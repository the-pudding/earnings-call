<p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eagle CEO, Scott Tarriff.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Well, thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We had an outstanding fourth quarter and full year. In 2018, we generated substantial cash flows that enabled us to advance multiple development program. Watch Big Bag, our 500 ml bendamustine formulation to complement BENDEKA, repurchased $78 million in Eagle Star and still end the year with a very strong balance sheet, which we will use to continue our product development and commercialization efforts and strengthen our portfolio.</p>
<p>Despite some challenges in 2018, we believe, we have multiple path forward to support the long-term earnings potential of our business.</p>
<p>I'll begin with an update on our Bendamustine portfolio, which has had some very significant catalyst in 2018 and here in early 2019. This business is strong and growing. In June of '18, we prevailed in obtaining orphan drug exclusivity for BENDEKA, the most significant product in our portfolio through December of 2022. We have always maintained that this exclusivity correctly apply -- applied would extend to train the project generics. Just last week on February 20, FDA issued a decision in favor of Eagle regarding the scope of BENDEKA's exclusivity. Pursuant to that decision, no Bendamustine product used to treat the same indication, including generic versions of TREANDA may launch (technical difficulty) until December 7, 2022, unless they're clinically superior.</p>
<p>Prior to the decision generic versions of TREANDA were poised to enter the market in November of 2019. We are obviously very pleased with the ODE results. This is now the most servitude, we have had with our Bendamustine asset since we launched. We should now have close to four years of continued exclusivity. Royalties from BENDEKA sales by Teva totaled $31.9 million in the fourth quarter and $134.4 million for the full year. The cash flow will allow us to build out the pipeline, both organically and externally. We are working aggressively on both, and I will discuss some of this today. To fill the need in the market for a lower cost alternative we launched, Big Back, our 500 ml liquid Bendamustine solution that does not require reconstitution, during the second quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>For the year, Big Bag sales totaled $22.9 million and we exited 2018, with a 6% share of the Bendamustine market. Based on recent pull-through data, we expect to exit February with a 10% share. The combined Bendamustine franchise revenue and royalty totaled $181.8 million in 2018. Teva continues to do an outstanding job. We believe, we have identified an additional value creating opportunity driven by our Bendamustine franchise that may allow us to generate a step-up in value. We hope to be able to discuss this additional value with you shortly.</p>
<p>Turning now to our RYANODEX program. In Q4, we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the US Military to conduct a study to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of RYANODEX. This study is now under way with three of the six animal cohorts already challenged. We expect to complete the study in the next few weeks, rodents exposed to the nerve agent Soman will be treated with the current standard of care atropine therapy and randomized to receive RYANODEX or control vehicle as added treatment.</p>
<p>If approved RYANODEX would represent a first of its kind neuroprotective treatment to combat neurological damage due to nerve agents exposure, which often results in death. Our previous rodent study that indicated that rodents treated with RYANODEX and anti-epileptic drugs perform better in neuro behavior testing compared to animals treated with anti-epileptic drugs only and had substantially less brain damage.</p>
<p>Early indications from our ongoing study with the US military are very encouraging and we look forward to further advancing this program this year. We've also made progress evaluating RYANODEX as a treatment option for acute radiation syndrome or ARS. Last year, we conducted in animal study to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous administration of RYANODEX to prevent or mitigate ARS. Animals in each treatment group received a well-characterized high dose of radiation to their whole body and also receive randomly assigned RYANODEX in different treatment modalities.</p>
<p>The treatments were quite promising with less mortality post-treatment overall for the RYANODEX group and the non-treated animals, we plan to further explore an investigational indication for RYANODEX for the treatment on individuals exposed to high doses of radiation, such as nuclear power plant leakage or nuclear weapons and conduct additional research to evaluated for certain cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment. Given the nature of the indication is likely to be developed under the FDA's Animal Rule.</p>
<p>We are also continuing to work to develop in IM formulation for RYANODEX, which we allow even more rapid administration, enabling immediate administration to patients in need. By eliminating the requirement for an IV infusion, the associated wait time for IV administration would be removed, delivering a clear benefit to individuals in the life-threatening situations. We are pursuing IM administration of dantrolene as a new chemical entity with the FDA. If approved, we anticipate, we would be eligible for five years on NCE regulatory exclusivity.</p>
<p>Lastly, I'd like to address the next steps in the development of RYANODEX for exertional heat stroke. We have now conducted two distinct trials, I believe that based on the result, there is a clinically meaningful treatment effect with the use of RYANODEX ambition to standard of care cooling alone. In fact, we believe these data show that there is at least six times higher likelihood that a patient will have full CNS recovery using RYANODEX when compared to cooling alone. We are confident that RYANODEX works than anticipated, unless there is a need for a drug entry, which does not exist today. We have submitted a meeting request to FDA and hope to meet as soon as possible to discuss an appropriate path for.</p>
<p>Today Bendamustine assets are our largest revenue drivers, and last week's FDA decision ensures the durability of these assets. That said, there is tremendous additional potential in our pipeline. As I just explained, we are working to expand the value brand by advancing multiple promising programs and other pipeline product candidates, which have significant potential as well. And with regard to vasopressin and PEMFEXY, we are aggressively pursuing legal and to make our products available to patients as soon as possible. We are the first to file on the one-ml vasopressin injection product, which we submitted to the FDA as an ANDA referencing part of Vasostrict product. This patent litigation is ongoing with the trial scheduled to begin May 2020, depending on different factors we may be able to get to the market as early at the end of next year.</p>
<p>We continue our patent litigation related to our PEMFEXY product, which references Eli Lilly's Alimta in the Delaware Court, the related antitrust litigation stayed at least until the trial in the patent case. The patent trial scheduled to being in September 9, 2019. As we head into 2019, we will continue to build value in the business by gaining greater clarity regarding our pipeline, exploring new opportunities with existing products and delivering a very efficient business model that provides the cash necessary to execute our strategy.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, we now have the most servitude in the Bendamustine franchise that we've ever had. As likely, that these assets will continue to deliver similar value for another four years. The question going forward for us is how to best invest our Bendamustine cash flow, and our plan is to build out organic pipeline, which we will know more about over the next 60 or 90 days, to continue to buyback shares, when we think, it is appropriate and increase our emphasis on analyzing licensing opportunities as a way to ensure continued growth.</p>
<p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Pete to provide the view of the fourth quarter results. Pete?</p>
<p><strong>Pete A. Meyers</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you, Scott. In the fourth quarter of 2018, total revenue was $56.1 million compared to $46.8 million in Q4, 2017. Full year 2018 revenue totaled $213.3 million. In 2017, total revenue was $236.7 million, on which $37.5 million was the result of milestone payments. Excluding milestone payments 2018 revenue was up 7% compared to 2017, largely due to the sales of Big Bag, which we launched in the second quarter 2018, as well as continued growth in rent index revenue.</p>
<p>Big Bag product sales were $6.8 million in the fourth quarter. Based on IMS data, Big Bag market share of wholesaler shipments to end users, with 6% of the US Bendamustine market in the fourth quarter and we expect to exit February at a 10% share, so we are approaching our 12% aspirational market share. Eagle recognizes Big Bag revenue on shipments by Eagle to wholesalers. As anticipated, fourth quarter 2018 shipments to wholesalers were slightly below that of the third quarter due to the stocking that occurred in Q3.</p>
<p>Product sales during the fourth quarter were up 95% year-over-year, totaling $20.3 million compared to $10.4 million, largely due to Big Bag sales. For the year, product sales increased by $25 million to $70.4 million in 2018 compared to $45.3 million in 2017. Fourth quarter, RYANODEX product sales reached $5.1 million, up 10% on a year-over-year basis. RYANODEX market share in the fourth quarter was 47% in normalized unit terms, and 68% share of dollars. For the full year, RYANODEX sales totaled $20.2 million, up 15%, compared with the prior year.</p>
<p>Q4 royalty revenue was $35.7 million compared to $36.4 million in the prior year core. BENDEKA royalties were $31.9 million compared to $34.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, royalty revenue was $142.9 million compared to $153.9 million in 2017. 2018 BENDEKA royalties were $134.4 million compared to $145.8 million in 2017. In 2019, we expect Big Bag sales to increase and RYANODEX sales to be down due to the expiry cycle.</p>
<p>Gross margin was 67%, during the fourth quarter 2018, as compared to 71% in the fourth quarter 2017. Obviously, the gross margin on Big Bag sales is lower than that on BENDEKA royalties. The year-over-year compression in gross margin occasioned by the introduction of Big Bag revenue was partly offset by an expansion in RYANODEX gross margin. On the expense front, R&amp;D expenses were $5.9 million for the quarter, compared to $9.4 million in the prior year quarter. The fourth quarter year-over-year decrease reflects a substantial reduction in fulvestrant expenses partially offset by the cost of analytical work to support vasopressin ANDA.</p>
<p>Excluding stock-based compensation and other non-cash and non-recurring item, R&amp;D expense during the fourth quarter was $4.4 million. Full year, R&amp;D expense was $44.4 million compared to $32.6 million in 2017, reflecting the cost of the fulvestrant trial, as well as the vasopressin analytical work. Excluding stock-based compensation and other non-cash and non-recurring items, 2018 R&amp;D expense was $37.8 million, below our guidance of $40 million to $44 million. Based on our portfolio as it exists today, it is likely that our R&amp;D spend in 2019, will be lower than that in 2018.</p>
<p>SG&amp;A, expenses increased to $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $13.4 million in the fourth quarter 2017. External legal expenses associated with litigation of PEMFEXY, vasopressin and Bendamustine account for the year-over-year increase. However, full year 2018 SG&amp;A, decreased to $60.5 million, compared to $71.4 million in 2017. 2017 SG&amp;A included the increased marketing expense relate to DHS, and the contract sales force agreement with Spectrum. The elimination of those expenses in 2018 was partially offset, by the aforementioned increase in external legal expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, and other non-cash, and non-recurring items, fourth quarter 2018, SG&amp;A expenses are $11.3 million, and full year of 2018 SG&amp;A expense was $43.1 million, below our guidance of $44 million to $47 million for the year.</p>
<p>Net income for the fourth quarter was $12.6 million, or $0.88, per basic share, and $0.86 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.1 million, or $0.61 per basic and $0.58 per diluted share in the prior year period, due to the factors discussed above. 2018 net income was $31.9 million, or $2.16 per basic share, and $2.09 per diluted share, compared to net income of $51.9 million, or $3.44 per basic, and $3.27 per diluted share.</p>
<p>Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2018, was $17.7 million, or $1.23 per basic, and $0.20 per diluted share, compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income of $15.6 million, or $1.05 per basic, and $1 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for 2018 was $59.2 million, or $4.01 per basic, and $3.87 per diluted share, compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income of $69 million, for $4.57 per basic share, and $4.34 per diluted share. For a full reconciliation of non-GAAP net income to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the tables at the end of our press release.</p>
<p>Our EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2018 was $22.1 million, compared to $16.4 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, EBITDA was $71.4 million, compared to EBITDA of $96.2 million in 2017. As a reminder in 2017, we earned $37.5 million in milestones. 2018 cash flow from operations, excluding receivables build was $65 billion. On October 30, 2018, the company entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with JPMorgan, pursuant to which repurchased $50 million in Eagle shares from JPMorgan.</p>
<p>Since our IPO, we repurchased $154 million in Eagle shares. As of December 3, 2018, the company had $78.8 million in cash, and cash equivalents. And $66.5 million in net accounts receivable, were $1.8 billion of which was due from Teva. The company had $45 million in outstanding debt. Therefore December 31, 2018, the company had net cash and receivables of $100 million after having bought back $50 million in stock in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>With that I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please go ahead and open the line for questions.</p>

</section><h2>Questions and Answers:</h2>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>(Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Ingerman</strong> -- <em>Piper Jaffray -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, good morning. This is Mickey Ingerman on for David. Thanks for taking the question. It's another -- there's been resolution on BENDEKA exclusivity, and you have greater visibility on cash flows from your Bendamustine franchise, and you guys discuss your current thinking around business development opportunities. I guess, there is a lack of near-term competition from 300 generics exchange your appetite or willingness to take on R&amp;D risk?</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Yeah, thank you for the question. Good morning. It does change things. This is the way we approach it now. We have four years of cash flow coming from Bendamustine, which is I stated on the call, it really does give us the most certainty that we had in the cash flow since we launched the product. And as we look to grow the company now, knowing that we are likely to have this four years of cash flow in place, we are excited about is, first, we have really great balance sheet, and so we have plenty of room to use the balance sheet if we elected. We also have a significant amount of cash, and the cash continues to grow, and at the same time, we have the equity and the stock if we needed to use that.</p>
<p>So it's clear, that we have all the wherewithal to grow the company. I think, the growth of the company is going to come, typically from one of two places, either going to -- come to pass through organic growth, or through external growth. Organically, I think, we're all pretty aware of what's transpiring. I think, there is going to be a lot of data that we'll see over the next couple of months. But to answer your question more directly, Yes, we're paying far more attention now to external growth, and how can that come, it could be potentially from products that are already on the market, it come from R&amp;D, it could be from M&amp;A. But I do believe that one way or another, we will grow this company, and we have the wherewithal to do it. And hopefully, we'll have more to speak to over the upcoming weeks and months, that how we see the growth is unfolding.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Ingerman</strong> -- <em>Piper Jaffray -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>That's helpful. And one quick follow-up if I may. I mean to the extent that you do look externally. Can you discuss your thinking about potentially pivoting to more paragraph four filings, versus sticking primarily to the 505 B2-based model?</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Yes, certainly. We clearly see ourselves as a specialty company, a branded company, and I believe, it's more likely, that we'll continue to work on projects, similar to what we have, where we find unmet needs or niches within the market too. You know that really move patient care, and to help our investors. I think it's unlikely or at least less likely for us to go into the ANDA space. Unless from time-to-time, things like vasopressin come along that we think, we're uniquely qualified to handle. But we should continue to think of ourselves as a specialty company, not a generic company.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Ingerman</strong> -- <em>Piper Jaffray -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks again.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>We'll take our next question from Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Busby</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey guys, this is Dan Busby on for Randall. Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Busby</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Few questions. Start-off, follow-up on that last business development question, could you just remind us where -- what your commercial capabilities are right now for example, how many sales reps you have and what kind of reach that gives you into the oncology and critical care hospital settings?</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Sure, Dan. Thanks for the question. So sales and marketing organization consists of 48 individuals, of which 31 are reps calling on the hospitals, the balance being marketing folks and sales management. David, did you want to comment further on the infrastructure. David Pernock is on the line with us.</p>
<p><strong>David Pernock</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Commercial Officer</em></p>
<p>Yeah, so basically we have a good question. We have -- our representatives are focused on calling a lot of the major hospitals right, several thousand hospitals and we also reach into the oncology market places while including some clinics. We also have ability to work with, the national accounts for contracting purposes, et cetera. And basically, we have a small marketing staff as well supporting our overall efforts. So we have a very good experienced team, most of our people, our leaders are very experienced in the marketplace and also people we hire are very -- have 10 to 12 years experience in hospital sales and our oncology sales. And basically, we feel we have the ability to handle the future oncology products as well as future acute care hospital-based products.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Thank you, David. And the -- and the only thing, I would add to that is, we are proud of the fact that we've been able to get to our 10% share, Big Bag as quickly as we have been. Clearly, we should get to that 12% that are -- that we've targeted quickly. And I think, that's due to the quality of the sales force that we've developed and we're pretty pleased with that and we think we have a strategic asset here at Eagle, a commercial group that we have is clearly strategic and we have the ability to add additional products into this infrastructure without adding much if any infrastructure cost to the company. And we believe that there's leverage in the P&amp;L going forward because of the breadth and the quality of the commercial team that we have.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Busby</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Great, thanks. And then just a follow-up on the Big Bag point, it's -- it's been a pretty strong uptake thus far, have you revisited your 12% market share target. I guess, in other words, is there potential upside to exceed that?</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>I would say that, we are consistent with our thought process, that 12% seems to be the right number. For a number of reasons, we're comfortable at 12% and what's important for us to do, at this point, I believe, is to leverage the value of the sales force and bring additional products into the company as a way to generate our growth. Clearly, the best way to create value for the company is to diversify away from Bendamustine. The good news is we have such a strong capable franchise for the next four years. The bad news. In some respects is that, it is a very significant part of our company and we should be using that sales force now to generate value from additional products, not just Bendamustine. I think, that's the best way -- the best path forward for the company to build a diversified long-term value for shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Busby</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And just one last question from me on EHS. So just to be clear, have you met with the FDA at all year. If so, what's the feedback then. And then, when can we expect clarity on the path forward with this fall within the 60 to 90-day timeframe that you referenced earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>I believe, so we've not met as of yet. We've requested our meeting with the agency that will happen soon and once we have feedback and a better understanding of the path forward will obviously report that to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Busby</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Brandon Folkes with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Folkes</strong> -- <em>Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And on RYANODEX for acute radiation syndrome and nerve agents. Could you maybe help us think through the timeline and process of getting this product potentially into the Strategic National Stockpile. I mean, is this something that could be procured under the emergency use authorization. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Brandon. Well, certainly it's possible. Let's, we're in the middle of the study now, we're about halfway through. As I mentioned in the call earlier that we're a few weeks away from finishing and then a few weeks after that having the results. Assuming that the results of this current studies are similar to the results of the first studies that we did and we're really very encouraged and excited about the neuroprotective capabilities of the drug. At that point, we'll start to have those conversations with the agency and with the government about how the drug would ultimately be used if it's stockpiled not just in the US, the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I do believe, that we are -- a few months, weeks away from being able to answer that question. Obviously, we're encouraged about the study results that we've seen in the first study, let's report out this next study that we're encouraged about. And I think, things will take care of itself. But we are still a little bit away from being able to accurately answer your question. And as it relates to radiation syndrome, I would say that we're a year behind where we are today in nerve agents and as the rest of this year unfolds, we'll continue to do more work around radiation indications and depending on the timing of that path forward, we should have more information for you later in the year or early next year.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Folkes</strong> -- <em>Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>(Operator Instructions) We'll go next to Timothy Lugo with William Blair. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Myles Minter</strong> -- <em>William Blair -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, Myles on for Tim. Thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter and the year. Just had a question regarding the timeline on the patient litigation cases from PEMFEXY. You sort of mentioned that you guys are pressing, that -- that you might from sales result in the best case scenario by the end of 2020. I'm wondering whether you have granularity on the timing for the PEMFEXY trail and when we're talking about additional organic growth opportunities from your pipeline, any work being done from our Eagle Biologics. If you can comment on that, that would be great.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Thank you very much. So that's a lot in there. Let me see if I -- if we have that all down. But from the patent litigation timelines, I think, we mentioned, we have our PEMFEXY litigation coming up in September of this year already. And so that's really just a few months away, let's see how that goes where we're still quite bullish that we think, we have a good hand in that case, let's get to trial and see how that goes and that don't follow normal order, as you normally see in these paragraph forward. We'll have the trial and hopefully we're victorious. And then, if that is the case, we'll just have to figure out the best way to monetize the asset and get it to the market. But that's the timing there. These are pressing the litigation is May of next year. And again the same timeline will go through a trail and get a response, hopefully, we will be victorious there as well. And then we'll have to determine at that point, the best way to monetize that asset as well.</p>
<p>But you can see, after a couple of years of hard work on all of this is coming to the ahead here in having two patent litigation trials taking place between September and May is quite a bit. Again, we feel good. Let's see what happens. And then we'll be aggressive as we always are figuring out how to build value for investors for those two assets.</p>
<p>In terms of the pipeline. The pipeline in its totality, we hope to continue to provide more information over the upcoming weeks and months, not just for the organic capabilities that we have and the products that we're working on, but certainly external growth opportunities that we're looking at. And as I stated earlier, we have a belief in the company that based on our balance sheet, our cash, our equity and most importantly, the strategic value that we see in the sales force. It would be in everyone's best interest that if we can construct a deal that makes sense to us from -- from an expense and timing standpoint to augment the pipeline with outside products as well. So we're being more aggressive with that.</p>
<p>In terms of the Biologics business that continues to move along recognizing that it's been a little slower than we anticipated. We continue to have high hopes that will be able to create partnerships using this technology. We're still very encouraged by the technology and we hope to have more information about the use of that asset and that we have in the upcoming months.</p>
<p><strong>Myles Minter</strong> -- <em>William Blair -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thanks for getting through that. And appreciate the color.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Thank you. Let me go back before we take any other questions potentially to Brandon's question earlier. You know, what I would add, as you look to the stockpile for an early agents. Once we get through radiation syndrome, certainly in the area of potential a nuclear bomb or discharge of a nuclear weapon at some place, the opportunity for the US government would be to have one pile of RYANODEX that would be able to cover the civilian population for both the nerve agent release and a radiation release. And I certainly think as we move through the opportunities around RYANODEX the likelihood ultimately winding up in the civilian stockpile will continue to increase.</p>
<p>And certainly once we put the product into an IM version, then we will have the -- hasn't happened by then, we have excellent opportunity of being able to have a full dissemination of RYANODEX available to the population, if unfortunately it's needed. And with that, do we have any other questions.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>There are no further questions at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Tarriff</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Okay. And with that, I'd just like once again to thank everybody. We had a really very positive quarter. We're expecting a very positive next several years at the company. We are very focused on growing this company in -- the many opportunities we have to do that, look forward to having additional positive information to share with you. And I appreciate the time that you spent with us today. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And this will conclude today's program. Thank for your participation, you may now disconnect. And have a great day.</p>
