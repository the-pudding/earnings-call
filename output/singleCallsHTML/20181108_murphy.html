<p></p><div id="pitch"></div>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer </em></p>
<p>Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone. I have a bit of a cough today, so bear with me. Thanks for listening in today. 2018 has been an excellent year, both fortunately and operationally for Murphy. Our excellent third quarter results illustrate our commitment to a diversified portfolio, as robust production from our oil-weighted onshore and offshore plays continue to drive high margin realization.</p>
<p>Production in the third quarter averaged 169,000 barrel equivalent per day at 68% liquids. Production exceeded the high end of guidance by over 1,200 barrel equivalent per day. This beat was driven by outperformance in our onshore Canada Tupper Montney and our offshore Sarawak Malaysia assets.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, we generated $94 million and $0.54 per share of earnings. Our disciplined capital allocation enabled us to return 12% of our operating cash flow to our shareholders. We achieved an annualized EBITDA for capital employed of 21%, and maintained our balance sheet streak with $2 billion of liquidity. In the quarter, we also paid our own way while building our cash position.</p>
<p>In early October, following the announcement of our accretive Gulf of Mexico transaction, we received an upgrade from Fitch Ratings to BB+. We view this as a step in the right direction on our path back to investment grade. Through the cycle, we've maintained unique abilities to successfully execute deepwater projects offshore. We installed a Kikeh gas lift project in offshore Malaysia, as well as a Dalmatian subsidy pump in the Gulf of Mexico. We also successfully drilled the Samurai-2 sidetrack well, and after early analysis of well walls and core data, we now believe we have approximately 90 million barrels equivalent of discovered resource.</p>
<p>In our North American business, we were able to show continuous improvement and cost reductions by achieving lease operating expenses just over $6 for barrel equivalent sold. We simultaneously deliver on the our growth plans, while spending within cash flow and growing our Kaybob Duvernay shale by 2.5x year-over-year.</p>
<p>On Slide 4, subsequent to quarter end, we announced an extremely accretive bolt-on transaction in the Gulf of Mexico that will immediately provide additional free cash flow. This is accomplished by forming a JV with Petrobras, where we will ultimately own 80% of the combined company's assets for a consideration of $900 million subject to closing adjustments. The full details of the transaction can be found in our press release issued on October 10th. The deal is expected to close by the end of the month.</p>
<p>We continue to successfully execute on our strategy. We have returned to offshore exploration with success at Samurai project, our low-cost innovative offshore projects in Malaysia and the Gulf of Mexico, now installed and beginning to see production uplifts.</p>
<p>Our team delivered an excellent operational performance in the third quarter, where we see Kaybob continuing to exceed our expectations. During the third quarter, our diversified portfolio delivered a weighted average price of over $69 per barrel of oil sold. No matter the price of oil, Murphy remains advantaged to our peers.</p>
<p>Slide 6. Over the course of 2018, we delivered strong EBITDA per BOE from three core areas. These areas receive premium prices, which is the key to our high-margin generation and account for 70% of our total production and 70% of our annual capital. We generated solid results in EBITDA from these assets, ranging from $34 to $40 per barrel.</p>
<p>Slide 7. We're maintaining our full-year CAPEX at $1.18 billion, with the annual production being in the range of 168.5 thousand to 170.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Both CAPEX and production do not include adjustments for the recently announced joint venture. We intend to provide those updates upon closing. Fourth quarter production is expected to be in the range of 167,000 to 169,000 barrels per day equivalent. The fourth quarter is being affected by a series of temporary one-off events across many of our assets. We've accounted for those events in our production guidance.</p>
<p>The Gulf of Mexico production was shut-in in October due to the impacts of an active tropical storm and hurricane season. Malaysia had a series of mechanical issues in the field and some non-operated onshore facilities that lowered production levels. In offshore Canada, the scheduled turnaround to the non-operated [inaudible] field was delayed and extended into the fourth quarter. These issues have been rectified and production been restored to previous levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, recent flooding across most of our Eagle Ford Shale play caused shut-ins due to road damage at some of our facilities. At this time, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, David Looney, for a financial update.</p>
<p><strong>David R. Looney </strong>-- <em>Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer </em></p>
<p>Thank you, Roger. I'll be starting on Slide 8. Consolidated results in the third quarter of 2018 included net income of $96 million or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $66 million, which is a loss of $0.38 per diluted share in the same quarter one year ago. Our adjusted income was a profit of $61 or $0.35 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018, versus a loss of $6 million in the comparable quarter last year.</p>
<p>The adjusted income varies from our net income due to the following after-tax items. No. 1, an unrealized mark-to-market gain on crude oil derivative contracts of $21 million; (2) proceeds from an Ecuador arbitration settlement of $21 million. The Ecuador arbitration settlement relates to a change in fiscal terms for a block previously owned by the company. No. 3, a prior period net income adjustment of $9 million for the reconciliation associated with the unitization of the [inaudible] Field in Brunei working interest income. This settlement, which was signed in 2017, relates to the reconciliation of accounts among the Malaysia and Brunei parties. It is important to note that there was no change in the quarter to Murphy's working interest in the [inaudible] Field.</p>
<p>Finally, a loss on foreign exchange of $18 million. At September 30th, Murphy's total debt amounted to $2.8 billion, excluding capital leases or 38% of total capital, while net debt to total capital was 30%. At the end of third quarter, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility, and cash and equivalents were approaching $950 million at quarter end.</p>
<p>Moving to Slide 9, one of the hallmarks of Murphy over the years has been our disciplined approach to capital spending within our cash flow. As Slide 9 indicates, we're once again leading our peer group in this area, as Murphy is currently one of only two companies in our 17-company peer group to generate free cash flow every quarter this year. Additionally, as the graph indicates, our free cash flow yield calculated by annualizing our 9-month free cash flow and dividing by our equity capitalization at 930 ranked up first in this metric among the peer group. As you can see, while many others talk about free cash flow, we are Murphy are delivering.</p>
<p>This is really nothing new for Murphy, as we have always been focused on disciplined free cash flow generation and strong execution. We're not simply growing for growth's sake, but rather with the goal of operating each of our assets as a free cash flow generating entity. At present, among our primary assets, only the Kaybob Duvernay is expected to be free cash flow-negative for the year, which is not at all unusual for an early innings shale play such as this.</p>
<p>By employing this approach at the individual asset level, we generate free cash flow as a company, which we then allocate in a shareholder-friendly way. This disciplined capital allocation approach leads to predictable, consistent execution quarter in and quarter out. With that, I'll turn it over to Roger to review the company's operations.</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you, David. I'll start on Slide 11. The Malaysia assets continue to be a reliable free cash flow generating business. Our Kikeh DTU gas lift project is now complete. In the third quarter, we achieved a milestone with the Kikeh FPSO completing over 600 liftings since we started product with that assets. In Sarawak and South Acis we completed an in-field 3-well drilling campaign, with the wells now online. Sarawak we completed a 9-well gas recompletion project that allowed for continued gas deliverability up to 300 million cubic feet per day gross.</p>
<p>Our Block H roton FLNG project remains on track, with manufacturing completed for flexible flow lines and dynamic riser section. In Vietnam, our LDV development team continues to progress the field development plan and progressing approvals aiming to declare commerciality by year end.</p>
<p>In the Gulf of Mexico, we commenced installation of the Dalmatian subsidy pump late in the quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, the installation was completed and is currently delivering incremental production of 7,000 barrels a day equivalent gross, with rates exceeding 11,000 barrels equivalent per day gross. This increase of 250% from prior-quarter production. Also, this pump installation sets a record of longest umbilical use and subsidy pumps at over 22 miles. This again is an example that sets Murphy apart. Another industry first, as we implemented a technology we believe we can use long term in the Gulf of Mexico, includes our new joint venture fields.</p>
<p>Slide 12 on Eagle Ford Shale. During the quarter, we brought 9 wells online in Eagle Ford, all in Catarina. In the fourth quarter, we plan on bringing an additional 4 Catarina-area wells online. Eagle Ford Shale's team continues to lower drilling costs while maintaining completion costs, in spite of service cost inflation. We continue to see cost-per-foot improvements, with 2018 year-to-date below last year. We continue to lower completion costs with our 2018 year-to-date is now approaching levels from 2015 with a backdrop of overall cost inflation and performance-driven sand per foot increases during this timeframe. This is all from continued outstanding execution and procurement work. For the nine months ended September 30, this asset has generated $140 million of free cash flow.</p>
<p>Slide 13. The Tupper Montney continues to deliver reliable well performance and free cash flow with operating expenses below $0.60 this quarter, U.S. For the nine months ended September 30, the asset generated $12 million to free cash flow in this gas price environment. We continue to mitigate our AECO spot exposure to hedges and off-AECO sales, with 40% of our Tupper Montney natural gas exposed to daily spot. In the third quarter, we realized $2.25 per MCF Canadian for our gas.</p>
<p>Slide 14. An active quarter in the Kaybob Duvernay brings 10 wells online. At this time, we feel that our appraisal plan is complete, with the exception of the Two Creeks area, which we are drilling and executing today. During the fourth quarter, we plan to bring five wells online, which brings our total 2018 wells online to 27. At this point, we are on track to deliver a fourth quarter exit rate of more than 11,000 barrels equivalent per day in this field.</p>
<p>Slide 15. We continue to have strong well performance at Duvernay. Production increases 36% from second quarter, exceeding 10,000 barrels equivalent per day with 61% liquids. We continue to drill longer, faster, and cheaper wells. We drilled our longest well lateral in the plate exceeding 11,400 feet in the Kaybob West area. The fastest and least expensive drilled were in the Simonette area, where we drilled a well in 18 days for $3 million.</p>
<p>Our lease operating expenses continue to trend down. We achieved an all-time low $7.29 per barrel equivalent in the quarter, which is outstanding considering we have only operated here for two years, and delineating across all areas of our acreage. Murphy has only executed 36 new wells in the play since becoming operator, proving again outstanding execution.</p>
<p>On Slide 15, we're showing some of the results from the four well pads that we executed this year. Clearly illustrating value creation as we moved to full development mode with outstanding IP30 rates and cumulative production volume.</p>
<p>Seventeen. I'm pleased with our early results on our new, focused exploration strategy. Our Samurai-2 well, where we were able to find contiguous sands that were hydrostatically connected to up-dip pay zones, with the Samurai-2 Sidetrack, we maintained an adjacent block in Green Canyon 476, where we have proven oil team relations extending across three sands of the pay. As we analyze the well logs and core samples from the Sidetrack, we feel confident in increasing the pre-drill resource estimate from 75 million barrels equivalent to over 90 million barrels equivalent, while targeting a full cycle IRR of 30%. We're currently working on development plans and look forward to bringing you more information on how Samurai's success plays out in the new year.</p>
<p>Drilling King Cake Prospect, Slide 18. Today in the Gulf of Mexico, we will spud the Murphy operating King Cake well with a 31.5% working interest. The amplitude-supported prospect is testing the same intervals as the Gunflint nearby, with the primary objectives in the Middle Miocene. Murphy's net well cost is expected to be around $25 million. The mean gross resource potential is 50 million barrels equivalent, with an upside potential of 100 million barrels equivalent. With this mean resource size, we again see full-cycle breakeven of $40 per barrel or less, and successful cycle IRR of over 30%. We look forward to updating you all on the King Cake well in our fourth quarter call next year.</p>
<p>Slide 19. A quick update to two other important exploration wells at the Cholula prospect formerly known as the Palenque well in Mexico received exploration plan approval from the regulators, and we're now awaiting approval of the driven plan. We plan to spud this well now in early 2019. In Vietnam, we expect to spud the LDT prospect in 15-105 in the first quarter of 2019 also.</p>
<p>As you look back on '18 and forward to '19, we plan to drill our exploration wells in Mexico and Vietnam very early, plus two additional wells in the Gulf of Mexico. These exploration wells are exciting and allow for continued growth in oil reserves [inaudible].</p>
<p>In our non-operated offshore Brazil acreage in the [inaudible] Basin, the 3-D seismic survey is completed, and we'll have the fast track data to work in our offices in the first quarter of 2019. We continue to add to our Gulf of Mexico expiration inventory with the recent award of the High Garden prospect in Green Canyon Block 852.</p>
<p>In closing, we're delivering on our 2018 plan. I'm especially proud we won a few companies for free cash flow yield and returning significant cash to our shareholders. This is enhanced by our exciting new joint venture in the Gulf of Mexico that immediately delivers additional free cash flow. We have a unique ability to create upside for our shareholders with continued success and our exploration strategy. Plus, we're executing well in North America onshore and our global offshore businesses.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like, as usual, to thank all of our dedicated employees who work diligently each day executing our strategy. I appreciate your time today and I will open up for calls at this time.</p>
<div class="interad"></div><h2>Questions and Answers:</h2>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, if you do have any questions at this time, please press * followed by 1 on your touchtone phone. And if you should decide to withdraw your request, you will need to press * followed by 2. We do ask that if you're using a speakerphone, to please lift the handset before pressing any keys. One moment, please, for your first question, which will be from Arun at J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Arun, good morning.</p>
<p><strong>Arun Jayaram </strong>-- <em>J.P. Morgan Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Roger. I heard the words "free cash flow" mentioned a number of times in the commentary, which is encouraging, but post the Petrobras deal, in our model, we see over $800 million of free cash flow generation for Murphy at a recent price deck. I guess the question we have, is what are the thoughts you have on deploying that free cash flow? How to buy back debt reduction? Where's your thought process behind free cash flow in 2019?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, we want to use a portion of that free cash flow and get capex into the Eagle Ford. You can tell on our call today, we still have pretty good results there. But delivery four wells a quarter just won't make it in an oil-rich play like that that's low entry cost, working executing well, and executing well. So we want to get a lot of capex into that next year, increase the capex for that. I would say just to get the budget type things behind us here. We're going to release that in late January, which is not so far away from now. We have a significant accretive cash flow providing business to get closed by the end. I feel real good about that closing, about that change.</p>
<p>So our budget's going to be different from last year, but in a very positive way. We're going to be using both 60s, WTI low 70s sprint. We're not focusing on growth, but we're going to have production growth. We're going to have significant oil CAGR. We have probably a 50% increase of capex in the Eagle Ford alone. We again will have free cash flow ahead of our dividend there. We're not putting all this free cash flow right back to work and focusing it really just on Eagle Ford Shale, with the rest of our businesses being maintained and our exploration probably slightly less than this year.</p>
<p>Those are the things we're working on. So it's not that we're putting all that capital to work. Our capex will be higher. Our production will be higher. Our oil CAGR will be higher. Our oil weighted production will be higher, and our free cash flow yield is going to be higher. So it should be a very positive budget when we disclose it. We'd like to get this closed and go through our Board and do that then. So that's a roundabout way of answering your question.</p>
<p>At this time, we're maintaining our dividend and having additional free cash flow yield. We have the option of paying back some of the draw on our revolver with that over the next couple of years as we see fit, as oil prices behave, and have a lot of optionality around that, but we're very proud about how our budget's going to look and how we're looking once we get this asset in our control here real soon.</p>
<p><strong>Arun Jayaram </strong>-- <em>J.P. Morgan Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>All right. Two other quick ones for me. Regarding the Petrobras deal, I know it had a 10/1 effective date. Any estimate of how much cash that asset would generate between 10/1 and closing? And thoughts on maybe hedging the oil price just to reduce your overall, involving some of that cash flow stream from the Petrobras deal?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>It's 550 to 60 maybe in a month kind of thing, Arun. Something to that effect. Of course, you've got to get to the final closing statement. This is a complex transaction involving a bunch of assets. I feel pretty good about that number. We're not hedged in '19. We're using a low 60s WTI right now. I'm still comfortable with that because I'm comfortable with the outcomes I have in my budget, as I just went through the high-level budget discussion of our pillars for our budget. We're not hedging now and we don't think we need to. Our liquidity and our revolver situation, which is improving doesn't require that in our mind, and we're hopeful that oil prices will return to more stable times after we get through everything that's been going on of late, and not hedged today.</p>
<p><strong>Arun Jayaram </strong>-- <em>J.P. Morgan Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Just final question is, you reported in Q4 some kind of quarter-specific items, weather, etc. Is there any knock-on effect to some of the fourth quarter items that you highlighted in the press release toward 2019?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>No, I wouldn't anticipate that at all.</p>
<p><strong>Arun Jayaram </strong>-- <em>J.P. Morgan Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks a lot, Roger.</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. The next question will be from Leo at NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Hello, Leo. Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>Leo Mariani </strong>-- <em>NatAlliance Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good morning, here. A couple questions for you guys, here. On Kikeh, you guys obviously got that gas lift project working here. Just trying to get a sense of whether or not you actually see production uplift in Kikeh or is that more of a maintenance production? And if there is uplift, can you take a stab at quantifying that?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>There is some uplift on it. Probably in the 2,000 range. This is one of the sources of some mechanical issues we had. If you follow back on our prior calls, we were doing an in-field workover, some Sub-C wells and that's been flowing in. We've been doing a de-bottlenecking and lowering system pressure on a compressor on the platform, the main FBSO. All trying to get our DTU to work. It's not really had the uplift today because it's hurt by some water injection problems and some issues in shore with the gas plant where we sell gas, so it hasn't been a good time to get that kicked off, but it's performing very well, and we're going to add up to five more tubing strings between now and the end of the year.</p>
<p>I'm anticipating kind of a 2,000 increase. But then overall, a maintenance type of deal in a field that's produced now for 11 years.</p>
<p><strong>Leo Mariani </strong>-- <em>NatAlliance Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. That's helpful. And I guess a similar question around Dalmatian. You guys obviously talked about 7,000 BOE per day of incremental projection. Do you guys see that as sort of incremental flush production in the short term that might start declining lower than that 7,000? Or do you think that could be maintained for some period? What can you tell us about that?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>I think it's going to be maintained for a while. This is a mechanical situation. There will be no evacuation of oil from the reservoir as we go through. We're looking in the budget today, in our draft budget to drill another well out there because this is performing so exceptionally well. This is pretty much a pressure draw-down of the long pipeline system to allow the wells to evacuate oil at a lower pressure. It's working incredibly well. It's industry leading. It's an outstanding project executed here in our Houston office. And so I'm not seeing major decline coming out of that because it's a mechanical uplift that's overriding that well into '19.</p>
<p><strong>Leo Mariani </strong>-- <em>NatAlliance Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And that's helpful. And I guess you just mentioned potentially drilling another well there. I think in your prepared comments, you talked about two wells in the Gulf of Mexico in 2019. Would that be one of the wells?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>That would be in addition to that. That would be a well from a reservoir we have in that field. It's not an exploration well.</p>
<p><strong>Leo Mariani </strong>-- <em>NatAlliance Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. So it'd be two exploration wells potentially in the budget in the Gulf for next year?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Plus the finishing off of the Mexico and the Vietnam wells. Correct.</p>
<p><strong>Leo Mariani </strong>-- <em>NatAlliance Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. At then at Samurai, any initial thoughts on development program there? I know you guys just finished doing some appraisal or the size. But any initial thoughts on how that might go?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, we're very pleased with the outcome. Very pleased that this is a very nice resource size to use in the tie-back system. We have to work with our partner there. We just developed our pre-AFP to study various development plans. Probably looking at a 3- or 4-well-type development with probably 6 or 7 different completions in the various reservoirs we've discovered. We outlined, in early October, series of slides that shows how a development like that would work probably 18 months from drilling a well next year. We may not have to drill the well. We're in the middle of deciding that now. We could just drill a development well later. So looking at drilling a well late '19, full in oil two years from that point, 18 months to two years from that point. And these things are going to -- probably on a growth to production basis kind of top out in a couple of years at 30,000 gross. We're 50-50. And the client from there has a very nice asset with outstanding economics that can compete with any capital in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Leo Mariani </strong>-- <em>NatAlliance Securities -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>All right. Thanks for the color.</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you. Appreciate it, Leo.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you [audio cuts out] please press * followed by 1 on your touchtone phone. Next question will be from Muhammed at Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Muhammed Ghulam</strong> -- <em>Raymond James &amp; Associates</em> <em>-- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the question. So if I'm reading this correctly, Eagle Ford production is going to be down pretty significantly next quarter. What exactly the driver behind that?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, we had a pretty rough start and continued into this week. We've removed hundreds of yards of segments of roads going into some of our newer pads in the Catarina and Karnes area. With water, we had to get some actual boats there to go service and turn the wells. We're afraid to leave the wells where we can't attend to them, as the road is washed out. So it's put a hurt on that. Not so much on completions and drilling, we happen to be in a dryer area while we're doing that. And just a very limited well count and delivering 9 wells in 1 quarter, and 4 coming up in the next in the shale play, it doesn't take much to have the production declined. So again, our focus is to get our accretive business in the Gulf in order of tax advantage business, take that free cash flow and up our capital gain to have more consistent, non-front-end loaded Eagle Ford business that will not allow for those type of pullbacks, primarily this year.</p>
<p><strong>Muhammed Ghulam</strong> -- <em>Raymond James &amp; Associates</em> <em>-- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And in Mexico, so what are the prospects there next year? Is there any risk to the timetable given the new administration going to come in, in December?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>What was that again? And what areas? Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>Muhammed Ghulam</strong> -- <em>Raymond James &amp; Associates</em> <em>-- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>No. We're progressing well. We had a milestone of the exploration program approved. There are some nearby peers that are gaining approval with theirs that are slightly ahead of us. And they've been able to do it. We're communicating with them. Our relationship with the government and the quality of the permit that we turned in has helped us. They were outstanding team that used to working internationally here at Murphy. And the quality of our work, and able to get in and our relationship with them, and we feel that we are going to get the permit in December and drill our well.</p>
<p><strong>Muhammed Ghulam</strong> -- <em>Raymond James &amp; Associates</em> <em>-- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Can you remind us of the pre-drill estimated cost for that well and also the one in Vietnam? Do you guys have that in front of you?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>It should be here. Just one second. It's on the slide that we're using this morning. I was reading at it. Here we go. The well in the Gulf of Mexico will be $25 million for Murphy. The well in Mexico will be $15 million, and the Vietnam well will be around $20 million. And what else is your question on that, Muhammed?</p>
<p><strong>Muhammed Ghulam</strong> -- <em>Raymond James &amp; Associates</em> <em>-- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Pre-drill estimates?</p>
<p>The Kikeh well has a gross mean of $50 million or 31%. The Mexico well is 200 million barrels or 30%. The Vietnam well is 35 million or 40%, but all of these have enormous upsides ranging from 100 to 250 to 500 million barrel improvements. These are very big upside opportunities for us and our company.</p>
<p><strong>Muhammed Ghulam</strong> -- <em>Raymond James &amp; Associates</em> <em>-- Analyst</em></p>
<p>All right, thank you. That's all for me.</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you. Talk to you soon.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Next question will be from Luke at Energy Intelligence. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Johnson </strong>-- <em>Energy Intelligence -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my call. I was just wondering if among the exploration wells you're planning next year, if any of that involves further appraisal at Hoffe Park? I know you guys just acquired full operatorship there from Chevron. Just wondering what your plans might be for that discovery going forward?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes. In our current budget draft, a well to be drilled at Hoffe Park is included, and we're very excited about it.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Johnson </strong>-- <em>Energy Intelligence -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>And you got any resource estimate for that?</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>It'll probably be around [a million] barrel prospect at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Johnson </strong>-- <em>Energy Intelligence -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Did you have any further questions, sir?</p>
<p><strong>Luke Johnson </strong>-- <em>Energy Intelligence -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>That's it for me.</p>
<p><strong>Roger W. Jenkins </strong>-- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Roger Jenkins for any closing remarks.</p>
