<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon, and welcome to Skyworks Solutions Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded.</p>
<p>At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell J. Haws</strong> -- <em>Investor Relations</em></p>
<p>Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' fourth fiscal and year-end 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.</p>
<p>Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.</p>
<p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks Mitch, and welcome everyone. The Skyworks team delivered record Q4 and fiscal 2018 results, demonstrating the resilience of our business model within a choppy end-market environment. Let me begin with a few fourth quarter financial highlights.</p>
<p>We grew our top line by 13% sequentially and exceeded our guidance of $1 billion in revenue. We expanded gross margin by 30 basis points sequentially to 51.2% and we produced earnings per share of $1.94, up $0.30 or 18% sequentially and $0.03 better than our guidance.</p>
<p>From a fiscal year perspective, we generated revenues of $3.9 billion, up 6% with earnings per share of $7.22, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. And perhaps most importantly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, representing a 55% growth in cash returns as compared to the prior fiscal year.</p>
<p>Notably, the Skyworks team delivered our ninth consecutive year of record revenue and EPS, with strong design win traction across Internet of Things and mobile ecosystem.</p>
<p>Specifically, last quarter, we validated world-class performance of our Sky5 suite of 5G New Radio solutions, powered Samsung's Galaxy flagship phones, launched millimeter wave RF technology at major avionics suppliers and we secured wireless networking sockets at Cisco for high density enterprise applications.</p>
<p>We supported DOCSIS 3.1 cable TV gateways with 2.4 and 5-gigahertz front ends, enables smart audio solutions across Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo gaming consoles. We captured LTE Cat M content with the new blocks machine-to-machine modules.</p>
<p>And finally, we demonstrated exceptional momentum in automotive, ramping our connectivity and telematics solutions with BMW, Gilead, Hyundai, Tesla and Toyota.</p>
<p>In short, we are capturing large scale design wins across all key segments, spanning industrial, home automation, enterprise, automotive and defense as well as numerous flagship mobile platforms. At a higher level, Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapidly approaching 5G upgrade cycle and build upon the strong foundation we've established over the past decade.</p>
<p>Our conviction is based on a number of strategic catalysts. First, we're seeing a significant uptick in demand for our base station and small cell massive MIMO solutions, as carriers around the world require LTE-advanced technologies to achieve multi-gigabit speeds, driving network efficiency, higher capacity and greater coverage.</p>
<p>Skyworks' vast experience is at the forefront of these initial deployments, leveraging our complete portfolio, including amplifiers, circulators and switches as well as system level highly integrated engines. We are well-positioned to support the rapid deployments of the world's leading infrastructure OEMs.</p>
<p>Second, on the other hand of the broadband connection, our smartphone opportunity is poised for a step up in architectural complexity, which in turn drives a dramatic increase in addressable content for us. This expansion is driven by entirely new bands, complementing existing systems, reformed frequencies and expanded use of multichannel carrier aggregation.</p>
<p>And keep in mind, Skyworks already offers the industry's broadest portfolio for 4G LTE, proven and selected by the most discerning market-leading customers. We've demonstrated technology leadership across a vast set of critical product categories, as our market tech tested solutions resolve increasingly complex architectures, preparing us for the performance gains demand in 5G.</p>
<p>Our solutions uniquely cover the spectrum from low-to-high and ultra high bands, leveraging Sky1 and DRX modules to optimize transmit and receive performance. And beyond cellular, we augment this portfolio with equally innovative WiFi, power management, precision GPS and tuning solutions.</p>
<p>Further, we see compelling TAM growth driven by new product functionality, including 4x4 MIMO, antenna multiplexing and new millimeter wave technologies. At the same time, the broader IoT category continues to accelerate. With expanded 5G network capacity on the horizon, we expect 75 billion devices will be connected by 2025. That's three times today's installed base.</p>
<p>Leveraging our leadership across all major wireless standards, including 802.11ac and ax, LoRa, Bluetooth, ZigBee, threatened (ph) Z-Wave, as well as 4G LTE and 5G, we are well-positioned to capture a disproportionate share of this growth, particularly with the advent of autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, Industrial IoT and frictionless commerce.</p>
<p>Finally, our complementary and synergistic acquisition of Avnera provides a strategic set of differentiated solutions, as we see voice becoming a critical means of communication across a diverse array of AI and IoT applications. The acquisition of Avnera will enable us to capitalize on the rapid proliferation of cognitive radios and it's convergence with our advanced connectivity engines.</p>
<p>With that, I will turn the call over to Chris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q1.</p>
<p><strong>Kris Sennesael</strong> -- <em>Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Liam. Skyworks' revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 was $1.008 billion, up 13% sequentially, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was $516 million, resulting in a gross margin of 51.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially, following 20 basis points of sequential improvements in the June quarter.</p>
<p>Operating expenses were $136 million or 13.5% of revenue. We generated $380 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 37.6%, up 130 basis points from fiscal Q3. Our effective tax rate was 9%, driving net income of $350 million or $1.94 of diluted earnings per share, up 18% sequentially and exceeding our guidance by $0.03.</p>
<p>Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, fourth fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $209 million and capital expenditures were $112 million. We paid $68 million in dividends and repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for a total of $235 million.</p>
<p>As this is the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, let's also review our annual results. We delivered a record $3.9 billion of revenue, up 6% year-over-year. Operating income was $1.5 billion and net income was $1.3 billion, translating into $7.22 of diluted earnings per share, up 12% year-over-year.</p>
<p>In addition to our solid top and bottom line growth, we generated cash from operations of $1.3 billion. We returned over $1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2018, well over 100% of our free cash flow, with $243 million of dividend payments and $760 million in share buybacks as we repurchased just under 8 million shares throughout the fiscal year. We ended the fiscal year 2018 with cash and investments of $1.050 million and we have no debt.</p>
<p>Now, let's move on to our outlook for Q1 of fiscal 2019. Continued strength in broad markets, coupled with the launch of a diverse set of new high-performance mobile solutions is offsetting unit declines in premium smartphones and overall China softness.</p>
<p>As a result, in the first fiscal quarter of 2019, we anticipate revenue to be between $1 billion and $1.020 billion. We expect gross margin of 51.2%, plus or minus 10 basis points and operating expenses of approximately $140 million.</p>
<p>Below the line, we anticipate roughly $3 million in other income and a tax rate of 10%. We expect our diluted share count to further reduce to approximately 179 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of these ranges, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.91.</p>
<p>With that, I will turn the call back over to Liam.</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Kris. Skyworks delivered record results in fiscal 2018. Despite the near-term market weakness, we have a clear path to deliver our 10th consecutive year of revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2019.</p>
<p>This outlook is driven by sustained double-digit growth across our broad markets business, a powerful and expanding design win pipeline encompassing a wide range of customers and applications, world-class operational execution and scale and finally, our unwavering commitment to creating shareholder value.</p>
<p>That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the lines for questions.</p>
<div class="interad"></div><h2>Questions and Answers:</h2>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B Riley. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Ellis</strong> -- <em>B. Riley &amp; Co. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the question, guys and congratulations on the Avnera narrow deal close. So just the first question is, following up on some of the prepared remarks regarding some of the things that you're seeing on the integrated mobile side. Is it possible to break out the relative impact of unit issue that you're seeing with high-end smartphones versus the China softness that you're seeing vis-a-vis a flat headline guide versus what I think would be plus 5% to 6% seasonality?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. Craig, this is Liam. Yeah, if we look at Q4 and moving into Q1, what we have here is a great demonstration of content gain and moving up to some very complex engines within Premier smartphones and that had been a lot of hard work that we've done over the last six to nine months to make that happen.</p>
<p>So those devices were ready enrolling and demonstrated a strong performance in Q4 and that same set of platforms rolling into Q1 were discounted on a unit basis. So again, a lot of great content and premier Tier 1 smartphones, but a bit of a unit miss year that came in kind of late for us entering Q1.</p>
<p>And on the China front, China continues to be an important market for us. We have a very diverse position, strong relationships Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, great alignment with the MediaTek platforms as well. So that market tends to have a little bit of seasonality going into Q1 as the premier Tier ones tend to occupy and contain most of the share in the December quarter. But the China business is relatively in line with our expectation there.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Ellis</strong> -- <em>B. Riley &amp; Co. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>That's helpful. And then the follow-up maybe two part question; one part for you, one part for Kris. Kris can you specify what the Avnera contribution is in both fiscal fourth quarter and what you've baked into your fiscal first quarter guide?</p>
<p>And then longer term, Liam, can you provide some parameters around how we should think about the way this business can scale within your broad markets group and to what extent is it going to gain leverage and traction from the channels that you have within integrated mobile? Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong>Kris Sennesael</strong> -- <em>Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure, Craig. This is Kris here. So we closed the Avnera acquisition on August '17. So we basically had six weeks of Avnera on our books in the September quarter. Revenue was approximately $6 million at above average gross margin. So we are very pleased with the acquisition there.</p>
<p>In the guidance for the December quarter, we included $15 million to $16 million of revenue for Avnera.</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Right and alongside that Craig just to kind of follow up on the broad markets piece, the Avnera portfolio lines up very well with the technologies that we've deployed, already today. So if you think about historically the acquisition of PSI G that we made several years ago how we levered that unique technology, very specific technology and brought that through our channel not only in smartphones, but through a broad set of IoT customers. That same strategy will be deployed with Avnera and early innings look really good there.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Ellis</strong> -- <em>B. Riley &amp; Co. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Blayne Curtis</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, I know in this environment, you probably don't want to venture too far into March, but just kind of curious given it's reset and a quarter that's typically stronger, give any perspective as to how does that translate into March?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure, Blayne. Yes, it is a little tough to go into March here, but we feel that the dynamics that we're describing that are imputed in our guidance right now, capture most of the pain here into Q1 and we expect, I would expect normal seasonality going into the March quarter. That's why we look at it.</p>
<p>You still have a broad markets business that has been able to offset weakness in mobile. When that occurs, we typically do have kind of some mobile seasonality in March, but there is nothing that we see today that would give us any kind of concern that there's going to be problems there. So we feel good about it. We are seeing more and more gains in the broader markets. They Avnera business is going to help. So we're in better position than we had been in the past to weather the storm in the March quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Blayne Curtis</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>And maybe just a question for Kris on gross margins, the Avnera deal is accretive gross margin, but obviously you're seeing a unit headwind, so that shouldn't hurt some of your absorption. Can you just talk us some of the moving pieces there. If you look year-over-year, margins are down a little bit. I know you've talked about kind of that margin clicking up over a longer horizon 10-20 Bps a quarter. Can you just tell us what are the moving pieces there?</p>
<p><strong>Kris Sennesael</strong> -- <em>Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Yeah absolutely. So first of all in the September quarter, we further improved our gross margins with 30 basis points in addition to 20 basis points that we added in our second fiscal quarter. So I'm pleased with that.</p>
<p>We will continue to drive further gross margin improvements. Obviously volume growth always helps with that and so the guidance for the December quarter is kind of flattish from a revenue point of view. And so also flattish from a gross margin point of view, but as we look into the back half of fiscal '19, we will continue to make further improvements on gross margin toward our target of 53%.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Caso</strong> -- <em>Raymond James -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess, first question would be with regard to 5G content and I guess I'm not sure I feel like we have the whole picture here with regard to where your content is going to stand with 5G with some of the new frequency bands.</p>
<p>Last quarter I think the word you used is that you're being crafty. Is it safe to say that there is some new technologies that perhaps you're not ready to talk about now, but things that would strengthen your position allow them to allow you to address some of the new frequency bands and some new technologies needed as we go into 5G more than what's been disclosed so far?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure, Chris absolutely, good question. So let me just begin with the fact that we are extremely well positioned to lead in 5G. There is a big step up in technical performance. We're working with customers today. We're sampling, we're getting feedback, we're getting validation on what we're doing and how that's going to work in their system. So that's for sure.</p>
<p>And that will include enhancing and upgrading even the backward compatibility in 4G even those devices will need to be altered in some way to work in a 5G world and then when you move into 5G proper, when you start to really deliver frequencies above 3 gig and above 6 gig, there some new technologies.</p>
<p>Millimeter Wave is an opportunity in a technology that we have some great expertise on and we think that would be compelling and differentiated in our customer solutions and it's a technology that we're being asked to deliver now and asked to sample now.</p>
<p>You're going to see more and more work done in our filtering technology, not only on the low-band that gets enhanced in the mid-end but we're going to start to really step up in high-band.</p>
<p>And having said that actually, we've done a lot of work to develop our filter technology and we talked a little bit about it, but we didn't fully disclose some of the work that we've been doing. And today, we're ready in BAW. We're developing BAW in house, we've made targeted investments as part of Kris' CapEx number here.</p>
<p>And we're working on sampling and we have number of customers that are very interested in. We're iterating through the normal process that we have with all of our technologies, but we will be ready when 5G comes for full capability across the whole spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Caso</strong> -- <em>Raymond James -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>All right. That's very helpful. Thank you. And if I could just return to some of your earlier comments with regard to some of the unit headwinds you're facing now and my interpretation of your comments is that, that was Tier 1 unit headwinds, is what you're referring to, as you went to last year, there was some abnormal seasonality with regard to shipments. The timing was a little bit different.</p>
<p>Does that have something to do as we're looking at the year-on-year growth that you're looking in the December quarter? Does that also have something to do with it as well should help us to do the math there?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, the timing is tricky. As you know Chris. Our job is to put forth the most compelling content and grow that content in advance our customer's performance and we did all of that. So it's tricky to see how the dynamics are playing out.</p>
<p>I think some of the signals that the Tier 1 players have provided have been helpful that everybody's understanding and digesting that. As we get into March, as I mentioned on the last question, it is kind of early to tell, but we don't expect anything, out of the ordinary. We still have a solid robust broad markets business and in some of the APAC players don't have the negative -- the negative cycle in the March quarter. In some cases, that can be offset.</p>
<p>The other thing I would say is just reflecting back on the prepared remarks. We are still modeling growth in 2019. So we are absolutely committed to delivering topline and EPS growth through the fiscal '19 quarter. So it's only Q1 here that we're talking about, but we're comfortable with that.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Ambrish Srivastava</strong> -- <em>BMO -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi. Thank you very much. Liam, just so that we are on the same page, how would you characterize normal seasonality for the March quarter? I know the business is now sort of little bit more of the broad based segment as well and then I had a follow-up for Kris.</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, market seasonality, it tends to be 10% to 15% or so, I think 12% at the midpoint. We always aspire to do better. It is early to make that call, which is concluding Q4 and guiding Q1. But that's the typical range that we see. We certainly do expect some of the things that we do in non-mobile areas to offset potential mobile volatility.</p>
<p>But net-net, as I said, we're committed to growth in the year. March I'm sure, we'll be fine in March, but that quarter is not fully guided.</p>
<p><strong>Ambrish Srivastava</strong> -- <em>BMO -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And then on the modeling front, Kris, what is the CapEx and then also the OpEx implications from the acquisition please. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Kris Sennesael</strong> -- <em>Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes. So from a CapEx point of view, in fiscal '18, we spent slightly over $400 million in CapEx, which was just over 10% to revenue. We continue to expand the capacity in our filter operation as well in our backend operation.</p>
<p>And as Liam indicated as well, we continue to advanced the technology in those factories and make the necessary technology related CapEx investments as well. So going forward, I do expect CapEx to stay on or about the same level as a percent to revenue as it was in fiscal '18.</p>
<p>In terms of OpEx, you can see a little bit of a step up here in the December guidance and that's mainly driven by a full quarter of the Avnera OpEx that will hit us in the December quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Vivek Arya</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my question. First just a clarification. Kris, could you give us the mix of mobile and broad market for September and what you're expecting for the December quarter?</p>
<p><strong>Kris Sennesael</strong> -- <em>Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. So in the September quarter, broad market was approximately 28% of total revenue. It was growing double-digit on a year-over-year basis as well on a full year basis, broad market was growing double-digits. So we are very pleased with the performance there.</p>
<p>We have now an annualized run rate of $1.1 billion in our broad market and looking ahead into Q1 of fiscal '19 we continue to see very strong double-digit year-over-year growth. So, on the flip side, of course, we have our mobile business, which was 72% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18.</p>
<p><strong>Vivek Arya</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>All right. And then maybe Liam one more on the visibility, as we look forward right, you mentioned that December is perhaps the bottom here and that you could get back to seasonal trends in March. I'm curious what is giving you that confidence?</p>
<p>If you could perhaps give us some real time sense of orders, have they stabilized? Just in general right, give us some more confidence that December is the bottom and things could get back to normal for March or is it primarily predicated on your broad market seasonally doing better, and China returning back to growth and offsetting whatever remaining declines are at your larger U.S. customers?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Right. No, that's great question. As I said, it's really hard to give a full complete view of the March quarter. What I would say is from where we stand today, we comprehended what we thought were the magnitude of the reductions that we could see and we've contemplated those in our guidance.</p>
<p>We look at the March quarter and we expect it to be in the range that I just articulated somewhere in the 10% to 15% sequential, which is normal. We do have some positive catalysts around broad markets. We think a better China environment in that period and then we'll see what happens with Tier 1 smartphone units, but we should be positioned to outperform and hopefully the market runs up a little bit, but in any case again we are committing to a full year -- full fiscal year of growth and earnings top line and bottom line.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thanks you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Hettenbach</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yes. Thank you. Liam, just to follow up on that point, just looking at how the fiscal year could potentially play out, so December and March would be down roughly 3% or 4% year-over-year and to grow in a full fiscal year, is there anything unique happening right now from an inventory perspective or unique in the back half of next year, you have some line of sight from a content just as to get to growth after the first half looks to be a little challenged?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, I think we should expect some recovery going into the second half of the year and then we have a lot of new design wins and platforms and programs that we're ramping mobile, but in many cases some of the broad market work that we're doing.</p>
<p>Lots of opportunity with the Avnera channel. We're already seeing customers embrace the Skyworks brand and our scale. Quite frankly, what we offer there is more than just a sales and marketing team. We have a tremendous reach operationally to do some high levels of integration where they have a discrete product line. So all of that's going to roll-in in addition to the core organic business. So those are some of the things that give us a sense of bullishness as we look out into the second half through the full 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Hettenbach</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. And then just a follow-up on Avnera and you mentioned kind of your side of your success story. Anything else you can kind of tie into that in terms of a playbook or how you see because Avnera has been around for a while, but just really your distribution and the ability to kind of ramp that business more strongly on the Skyworks' ownership?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. So a couple things. There is certainly an element around customer engagement and we have a great opportunity to leverage the years and years of customer work that we've done and the trust that we've built with our accounts to now bring Avnera through that channel, that's one.</p>
<p>We also have some amazing ability to create new solutions that would be very difficult for them to do on their own; leveraging our ability to package and test and bundle kind of think of it as a point product versus an integrated solution, i.e. SkyOne right. How we've taken kind of fundamental technology and wrapped it up into an engine, a system that made it much easier, much easier for the customers to consume</p>
<p>So they're doing some really special work in cognitive radio. So it's not just the audio portion, but it's also these highly sensitive microphones that listen and discern the voice of a signal to create a connection. So some incredible things that we can do together and the partnership should really perform well.</p>
<p>It will take some time before we see all the revenue build up, but we do think that it will be an impact positively in 2019 and in the outer years certainly a significant opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.</p>
<p><strong>Edward Snyder</strong> -- <em>Charter Equity Research -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thank you. Liam, what do you mean by your ready today in BAW? Have you sample duplexers in BAW and if so, what bands? We've heard of single BAW RX filter samples. Beyond that, we've not seen anything. So I am just curious you seem to make a much stronger statement about BAW this quarter than I've heard in any of your periods in the past, what's changed?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>What's changed, what's changed is that we've done a lot of hard work Ed. We've made investments in the technology. Our engineering teams have been working this for a long time and I haven't been talking about it because we weren't ready. But we're ready now and we are sampling with key accounts.</p>
<p>I don't want to get into all the details there, but we are sampling, we're getting feedback. There is credible iteration around the process and around the end products and as you know, we do it differently. We're not going to be a discrete filter company. We're going to be a systems level company. We're going to leverage that technology in our Sky5 suite, and just stay tuned for more developments.</p>
<p><strong>Edward Snyder</strong> -- <em>Charter Equity Research -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>So also this is going to be focused then in some of the -- most of the new products, the future products that you're putting out especially with regard to Sky5 and attacking and that was going to be higher, frequency bands in 5G, is that what we can expect to see the first samples of this?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, so we wouldn't -- our role here and our ambition is to move forward into 5G and there may be an opportunity for us to go back in the legacy architectures. But I don't think that's really the sweet spot. It's really the leverage that we have in providing customers a full suite of proven LTE solutions from SkyOne to diversity we see, augmenting that with 5G technology and then bringing some really compelling staff in the high-band to our customers.</p>
<p>Clearly this is something that's been on our agenda for a long, long time. We haven't talked much about it, but we're ready now and you're right, this is a lot more than we've said in the past and there's a good reason for it.</p>
<p><strong>Edward Snyder</strong> -- <em>Charter Equity Research -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. That makes a lot more sense and then if I could, it seems clear from this standpoint already that next year's premium phones, especially Tier 1 manufacturers, running headlong into this antenna problem and it looks like they will be pulling some BAW based DRX functionality. So I know, they will kind of redesign the whole thing.</p>
<p>But where does that put Skyworks? You've got a huge amount of content and I am sure you've got significant increase year-over-year in content in that section too. I don't expect you to be locked out giving you are the premier supplier, but does that put you into a little bit of a disadvantage for those bands that are looking at lowering insertion loss or is it something you can do with this new technology you're talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, no, we are very solid in the whole DRX family from low to mid to high, and that's been in place for a while and there is obviously iterations and improvements in performance that we make annually.</p>
<p>On the antenna multiplexing, I think that's a new opportunity for us that we will also pursue. So we will certainly protect our core on low-band and high-band DSM as we go forward, and our filtering technology today is perfect for that and we know how to curate and alter that if we need to.</p>
<p>But some of the other opportunities that are out there are still on the drawing board and we'll have the technology to address. It's not going to all happen in one cycle, but I'm really pleased with the team's performance, their patience, their diligence, their hard work, some of the devices that we're putting forth today, I'm really happy with, and I think we'll be able to demonstrate that in the market very soon.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Arcuri</strong> -- <em>UBS -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, thanks. If I look at the overall revenue growth, you guys have sort of barely grown year-over-year despite all the content growth the past couple of quarters and despite broad markets growing kind of like low teens year-over-year.</p>
<p>So if I look into March and I assume sort of a down 10 to 12 normal seasonal, you're going to be, it looks like down again year-over-year in March. So can you just again highlight why is that the case? Is it really high-end smartphone, is that why the company is not really growing in the last four quarters? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, listen, we just grew fiscal 2018, we're going to grow fiscal 2019. We talked about that. The fundamental change here from what would have been a more bullish guidance is really the unit change with some of the premier higher-end players where the content has been very significant. That's the fundamental issue.</p>
<p>There some China softness, but that's not a big surprise for us. That's something we've contemplated. We have a broad set of accounts. We have a broad set of technologies that we're bringing to market. We have new solutions coming out into 5G. We have an IoT landscape that continues to grow at double-digits and the broad markets that continues to grow double-digits. So we are not guiding the whole quarter-by-quarter, but we are comfortable with providing an outlook for the year in total, which will be top line growth and bottom line growth.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>Srini Pajjuri</strong> -- <em>Macquarie Capital Inc. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess, Liam, just want to understand the, I understand the outlook being a little bit weaker because of the unit weakness, but given your content expansion, I would have expected a little bit more upside to the quarter. You came in line, which is a pretty decent, but I'm curious, have you started seeing the weakness in the quarter itself or were there any other puts and takes that impacted the quarter?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>In the 4Q period, not really. A little bit of softness in China and I think it was a fairly strong quarter for us. We exceeded guidance. We grew EPS by $0.30, 18%. The 1Q impact is what we're seeing now and we're talking through. So I think that's something that we've imputed into the guidance.</p>
<p>We think we've taken the right amount of pain in the guidance on that. Our content position is solid. There is no share loss in our leading platform. So it's not a case where we fumbled and didn't execute or weren't able to win the sockets that we pursued, but across the most compelling platforms, the larger Tier 1's were just -- there's a bit of an impact there. We'll be able to recover from it. There's other parts of the business that are doing really well and I think this part of the business will recover as well.</p>
<p><strong>Srini Pajjuri</strong> -- <em>Macquarie Capital Inc. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Great. And then just to follow up on that Liam, as we look out to the next fiscal year, I'm guessing in 5G, it's little bit early, but over the next four quarters, can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in 4G? Looks like Qualcomm is definitely making some progress and the market is not growing in terms of units and are you seeing any more pricing dynamics out there and any more intensity in terms of the competitive nature? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, what I'm seeing and this has been a theme that's been going on for a while, is that the competitive landscape honestly, is getting more and more driven by two or three players right maybe four. And you have to have a broad set of technologies and you have to have the agility to work with multiple customers and solve their problems.</p>
<p>And the complexity within mobile platforms, especially at the high end, and the high end is where all the money is being made by the way. It's where the money is being made by the OEMs, and they rely upon suppliers that can do the hard work for them. The hard work delivering very, very high performance transmit and receive WiFi, tuning, having the scale and having the techniques to do the filtering that we've talked about in the last few questions, all of that.</p>
<p>So we don't really -- in fact that environment has been very good for Skyworks. It's given us a chance to outperform and leverage our technical expertise, our manufacturing scale and the investments that we've made in some of these high-performance filters.</p>
<p>So I think the competitive field is going to narrow and the complexity and challenge is going to be very, very high and those that can deliver and meet that challenge will do well. It will be among the few that can do that.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Peterson</strong> -- <em>JPMorgan -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, thanks for taking the question. I guess, when we think about the full year growth that you're talking about next year, and how it's going to be stronger in the second half. What is this driven by? Is it 5G? Is it more content in China, increased content in some of the flagships, what type of products is it, tuning plexing, more diverse to receive, if you can help us understand what's going to drive this growth next year that would be helpful?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, there's certainly there's new developments across multiple parts of the business. In the mobile side, we're continuing to drive a content move across all parts of the portfolio. So we talked a little bit about the high end, but also in the mid-tier, there is an equally important opportunity to take mid-tier players in China and other markets and even some of the Samsung portfolio to take mid-tier phones up a level to advance their technology in 4G.</p>
<p>And we are starting to see and we are developing right now 5G solutions that we know are going to market and they're going to create a meaningful catalyst. We talked about that in the prepared remarks, there will be meaningful new technologies in 5G product, that's an opportunity for everyone in our space to pursue and I certainly like our opportunity given our experience with customers, the manufacturing assets that we have, the technologies that we have and the ability, and I'll use the word crafty again, the ability to do very, very hard things with very high demand from customers and be able to have the flexibility to make it work for each and every one.</p>
<p>The more you go long in the technology and you move into 5G, people do it differently, customers do it differently. They select different bands, they have different performance budgets, current budgets and it makes it more challenging for the suppliers, and having that knowhow and that broad breadth of experience with baseband providers and multiple customers, puts us in a good position.</p>
<p>So we'll start to see that in the second half of this calendar year, more and more complex engines. The IoT space continues to move up. The Avnera y opportunity, we're getting our first year of that, that's going to be incrementally positive for us as well. So there is a number of very positive catalysts going on here as we get through the 1Q and 2Q periods.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Peterson</strong> -- <em>JPMorgan -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And as my follow-up, maybe sticking on 5G, and you talked earlier about millimeter wave, a competitor discussed in their call yesterday that millimeter wave would be required at launch next year.</p>
<p>I guess the first question is, do you agree with that? And I guess I would think that sub-6 would be more and more likely to start and millimeter perhaps later. But if you can expand on your expectations from the market perspective and then as well as expand on your own millimeter wave products both from maybe infrastructure as well as the smartphone?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. Yes, we are seeing a kind of a stepped up pace on millimeter wave and we'll be positioned to deliver on that. So that's something that could be a very positive catalyst for the industry. We are absolutely positioned to execute on that area, certainly on the handheld side and also on the infrastructure side.</p>
<p>There's a lot of IP in our company that goes back into the infrastructure days where we have a lot of IP around millimeter wave and some other technologies that we can deploy that typically haven't been used quite frankly in handheld devices. So if we're able to deliver that, I think that would be exceptional. We are working on it. It's not new for us. It's just about the pace in which our customers want to deploy the technology. We'll be ready on the semiconductor and systems side. It's really a matter of when does the market want to see this technology in a commercial use.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Ackerman</strong> -- <em>Cowen and Company -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good afternoon, Chris and Liam. It would appear the acquisition of Avnera is a precursor for additional bolt-on M&amp;A. Are voice applications are primary focal point going forward or are other areas such as networking infrastructure, more palatable as you build your economic around 5G and separately, how much cash do you think you need to run the business today? Thank you?</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure, I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Kris. Yeah, I think there is one of the things call that we like is in our deals and obviously we haven't done many and those that we've done have worked out pretty well. We had a very discerning view on these transactions, but one of the things that we like about this technology is that it dovetails so well into the areas that we've already created some real value.</p>
<p>So there comments that our customers in some areas, both in IoT and then somewhat in mobile, there is an opportunity for an integration process to occur leveraging their core IP more to chip level and then wrapping that up with our MCM technology and our packaging technology to do something even bigger and then we just have, kind of a real broad customer scale opportunity across the globe but we have a big team at Skyworks that's in just about every mobile and IoT customer you could imagine and comparing that with a great organization at Avnera, but just much, much smaller.</p>
<p>So you could see how that leverage plays and the technology today is really good. We don't have to fix their technology. It works. It's great. It's just a matter of bringing it to market and maybe changing some of the form factors to create more upside and more configurability.</p>
<p><strong>Kris Sennesael</strong> -- <em>Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>And so, on the question of the cash to run the business, well, we ended last quarter and the fiscal year with have just over $1 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet. That's definitely a level that's very comfortable. We actually need a little bit less of cash just to run the business. So we do have still access cash.</p>
<p>Given also the fact that we generate a ton of cash, we have a very strong cash flow from operations and very strong free cash flow. We continue to target of free cash flow margin of 30% and we will also continue with our cash returns to the shareholders. As we indicated in the prepared remark, we returned more than $1 billion of the cash to the shareholders during fiscal '18 and we will continue to do so in fiscal '19 through our dividend program as well as our share buyback program.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Ackerman</strong> -- <em>Cowen and Company -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Great, thank you, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And our final, final question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Harsh V. Kumar</strong> -- <em>Piper Jaffray -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yes, hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. I had a follow-up on the BAW. Congratulations by the way on getting BAW done in-house. We are hearing that the 5G handsets at least some models will be out in the second half of calendar next year, Liam, do you think your BAW products would be ready commercially around that timeframe?</p>
<p><strong>Kris Sennesael</strong> -- <em>Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, it's possible. We're in the middle of our design work and are sampling right now. So I don't want to hang a date on that, but certainly in the next 12 to 18 months as I indicated. So it's possible. It could be sooner. There's a lot of work to be done to validate and kind of leverage that spectrum. So we'll wait and see, but we're definitely going to be a player in that segment.</p>
<p><strong>Harsh V. Kumar</strong> -- <em>Piper Jaffray -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask another question on China. I assume that China is down in December. Did I hear you say correctly that by the March timeframe that China will be back to normal seasonal trend and then maybe you could tell us what that might be is China usually picking up in March of is it usually down for March?</p>
<p><strong>Kris Sennesael</strong> -- <em>Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>No, the seasonal trend is a sequential decline into the December quarter, a pretty strong sequential decline into the December quarter, but then typically in March, we see the business coming back with sequential increase.</p>
<p><strong>Harsh V. Kumar</strong> -- <em>Piper Jaffray -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thank you, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Liam K. Griffin</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
