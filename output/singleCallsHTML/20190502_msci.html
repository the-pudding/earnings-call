Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will limit participants to one question and one follow-up. Further instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
<p>I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Jay Penn, Interim Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Penn</strong> -- <em>Interim Head of Investor Relations</em></p>
<p>Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter which is available on our website along with our earnings presentation and the first quarter update. A copy of the release first quarter update in the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab.</p>
<p>Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You're cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.</p>
<p>During today's call in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP we also refer to non-GAAP measures including, but not limited to organic operating revenue growth rates adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow.

<p>On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President; Andy Wichman our Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Linda Huber, who will be joining MSCI as our new Chief Financial Officer officially this Monday, May 6.</p>
<p>With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Thank you, everyone for joining us today. Before I provide my comments for the quarter. I would like to take a minute and welcome Linda Huber to the MSCI family.

We're very excited to have her join MSCI and help us continue to build this incredible franchise. I would also like to take a moment to thank Andy for his leadership within our financial organization and congratulate him for his appointment as our Chief Strategy Officer.</p>
<p>2019 is off to a great start. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of 10 plus percent organic subscription run rate growth demonstrating the resiliency of our franchise and the strength of our business model. In Q1, we also hosted our first Investor Day in five years. It was a great success and we had a very significant turn out. I want to thank all of you that were able to join us.

<p>Page 3, our franchise remains incredibly strong as evidence to the performance that we had in Q1 and we feel confident of our prospects in 2019 and beyond. With that introduction and a review of what we cover in Investor Day to remind us all of what we did and where we are and where we're headed let me now turn the call over to Baer.</p>
<p><strong>C.D. Baer Pettit</strong> -- <em>President</em></p>
<p>Thank you, Henry. I'm pleased to share with you some key accomplishments from the first quarter. The long-term trends we have discussed in the past are all creating opportunities for us. These trends include the continued globalization of investments with investors shifting from a strong homebuyers to diversified global portfolios; increasing allocations to private assets and the need for greater transparency in these markets; as well as growing focus on sustainable and factor investing.</p>
<p>Investments we are making in technology such as our Analytics platform which we recently branded as Beon will further enable the use of all of our MSCI content to help clients build portfolios and understand the drivers of risk and performance. We also continue building out our capabilities at content in areas like fixed income. We now have industry-leading researchers and differentiated content which we continue to expand and complement with platform enhancements. These capabilities have been instrumental in fueling some of our largest analytics transactions and can be seen by the 8% organic subscription run rate growth for multi-asset class analytics. And these capabilities together with investments we have made in areas like ES&amp;G have been instrumental in helping us win some recent large transactions with global asset owners.</p>
<p>In fact we have one of our best quarters for sales within asset owners segment in the first quarter of 2019. Organic subscription run rate growth was 13% for asset owners in the first quarter. Growth within asset owners was fueled both by investors taking a much more proactive role in monitoring externally managed portfolios as well as of directly managing portfolios themselves. Our wins in the first quarter were the result of our continued focus on developing and deepening our relationships and engagement with large asset owners. In the first quarter several asset owners selected MSCI to deliver indexes designed to help them achieve specific investment objectives. As an example a client added minimum volatility equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes to a U.S. portfolio to help lower its overall volatility with a plan to allocate to other Factor ETFs over time.</p>
<p>An endowment used at MSCI ACWI X fossil fuels that's coal generation custom index to benchmark an allocation to a climate change strategy. A major plan seeking to simply reporting selected the MSCI ACWI Index for a policy benchmark which previously was a combination of Russell 1000, Russell 2000, MSCI EAFE World EM and EFA Small-cap. Our indexes were also selected by a client to manage a long-standing divestment policy on tobacco using the MSCI U.S.A ESG Universal ex-Tobacco and the MSCI World ex-U.S.A. ES&amp;G Universal ex-Tobacco indexes for two passive mandates totaling $375 million.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to highlight our regional growth. In the first quarter Asia was our fastest-growing region reinforcing the emphasis we put on Asia at our Investor Day. Organic subscription run rate growth in Asia was 13%. We had several notable wins in Asia in the first quarter of 2019 including one asset owner with well over $100 billion in assets who enhanced its risk management capabilities and developed deeper performance and risk insights using MSCI products and services.</p>
<p>This client selected our multi-class Analytics to help them better understand exposures run scenario analyses and position its portfolios in face of volatile markets. Overall we're very pleased with our consistent execution. I look forward to providing further updates on future calls.</p>
<p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy to provide some financial highlights. Andy?</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. As Baer and Henry highlighted this was a strong quarter that highlighted our continued success in executing our strategy. The double-digit organic subscription run rate growth in the quarter was driven by strength across all regions. Americas were up 9%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia up 13%. Asset owners and asset managers which together comprised about two-thirds of our subscription run rate had organic subscription run rate growth of 13% and 10% respectively.</p>
<p>More broadly many of the areas where we are seeing the strongest momentum our areas where we have been investing over the past couple of years. Areas such as ESG wealth and Asia all have run rate growth rates above 12%. We're continuing to fund and expand these long-term opportunities remains a top priority we're also looking to add layers of growth for the future. For example in real estate we continue to develop our enterprise Analytics platform. This platform is allowing clients to more easily access and interact with our real estate benchmarks analytics and market information as well as to much more easily contribute their proprietary data which underlies of those tools. We also continue to invest in data science capabilities. In addition to driving productivity and operating leverage across the firm these capabilities are enhancing the breadth, richness and quality of our content across areas like analytics models and our ESG research.</p>
<p>Additionally recurring subscription sales and net new recurring subscription scenes were quite strong for the first quarter up 16% and 34% respectively as we were successful in closing a number of deals in the pipeline. As you know timing of deals can lead to some lumpiness in net new quarter-to-quarter. Overall the business landscape looks solid and our subscription business remains on track. AUM and equity ETFs linked to our indexes are touching all-time highs driven by healthy cash inflows and favorable market movements.</p>
<p>Of the $28 billion of inflows during the quarter about one-third or $9 billion came from funds based on U.S. exposure indexes that represented over 100% of all flows into U.S. exposure ETFs during the quarter. Much of these flows into U.S. exposure products was in the ETF space on our Factor indexes where we witnessed strong flows into low volatility and quality products. Overall we saw close to $12 billion of flows into ETFs based on our Factor in ESG Indexes.</p>
<p>Now before we open the line to questions, I wanted to draw your attention to a few points including some comments on our guidance for the year. Given the strong business landscape the strong momentum we are seeing in key growth areas and the elevated levels of AUM and equity ETFs linked to our indexes relative to where we were at the beginning of the year. We plan to capitalize on some of the attractive growth opportunities in front of us and plan to make some modest incremental investments. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA expenses to be toward the top end of the guidance range of $685 million to $705 million.</p>
<p>We believe these are high return investment areas that will continue to fuel the long-term growth of the Company. I want to underscore that long-term positive operating leverage remains important to us. Overall our guidance reflects our disciplined approach to improving productivity and becoming more efficient while still finding investments. It's an approach as paid off over the last few years with high subscription growth rates and margin expansion. With regards to our tax rate guidance based on the $67 million income tax windfall benefit related to divesting in the first quarter of the multiyear PSUs granted to certain executives in 2016 we are lowering our full year 2019 effective tax rate guidance to be between 9% and 12%.</p>
<p>This benefit for multiyear PSU awards represents a full year benefit of approximately 11 percentage points and will be excluded from adjusted EPS. Excluding this benefit we expect the effective tax rate used for our adjusted EPS to be more in the range of 20% to 23%. Lastly, I want to comment on one reporting update. We've historically posted the prior month's end AUM and average monthly AUM in ETFs linked to our indexes on our Investor Relations homepage on the second business day of the month. For the April figures, we will be posting the information on or about May 15. We've recently made some changes to the data vendors we used to track his data and as a precaution we are allowing for sufficient time for testing and transitioning of the data to ensure meets our quality standards.</p>
<p>With that, I'll now open the line to take your questions.</p>

</div><h2>Questions and Answers:</h2>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Toni Kaplan</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thank you. First congratulations, Linda and Andy on the new roles. Andy just mentioned that you're going to be at the higher end of the expense guidance because you're investing in some of the opportunities and you mentioned a lot of those opportunities at the Investor Day. Just wanted to get a sense of which ones in specific that you're most excited about you're going to be spending the incremental money on versus where you originally expected? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>C.D. Baer Pettit</strong> -- <em>President</em></p>
<p>Hi, Toni, it's Baer here. So these are all previously prioritized investments that we feel strongly about and we've discussed previously the three main buckets we're going to be putting some incremental money in are ES&amp;G, fixed income and our technology investments notably in our platform and beyond. So those are the main areas we're focused on at present.</p>
<p><strong>Toni Kaplan</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>That's great. And then separately in ESG, we're hearing all the time about companies trying to get into that area just given the fast growth in the market. And Moody's for example recently acquired the majority stake in a provider of ESG research in assessments and basically wants to create standards in ESG and I know you're already doing that. So, I just wanted to get a sense of -- if you're feeling like the market's getting more competitive. I imagine that you're being a first mover really helps, but just want to understand a little bit better the competitive environment and your differentiation from competitors and sustainability of growth in that area. So, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Yes, Toni to it will be -- clearly MSCI is the leader here in this space and we want to continue to drive for that leadership in terms of clearly investments and revenue growth and profitability of this product line. A major area of differentiation that MSCI is trying to bring to this market is to have an integrated comprehensive product line for sustainable investing from the research that is needed for investors through screen or exclude different type of investments to the ESG ratings we currently rate about 15,000 issuers around the world and counting. The ESG Indexes that can be -- that can serve as a basis for portfolios of equity or fixed income instruments and also the ESG as factors in our equity and multi-asset class risk models to understand risk and performance in portfolio given ESG characteristics</p>
<p>And lastly to be able to put all of that content all of that ESG content in our Analytics platform especially Beon, the new branded Analytics platform. So that's an area of significant deflation, but obviously to drive that leadership and to drive that growth that we've experienced we need to be at the forefront of industry of security coverage of having client coverage personnel participating in conferences unlike and there to put a lot of new technology in terms of data science and the newer technologies of AI and machine learnings to capture a lot more data for the inputs into ratings. So that is the reason why we are stepping up a bit the investment in ESG going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>And Toni you've probably noticed, but the ESG run rate growth remains very healthy both on -- what we call ESG content side or the ratings side, as well as on the index side. And so the ESG ratings on the research side or the content side run rate growth ex FX was in the mid-20%. And then on the ESG Index side 43% and notably among ESG Index subscriptions the run rate growth was 53% and we saw pretty strong health across geographies and particular strength in Asia along the lines of Baer's comments earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Toni Kaplan</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Kramm</strong> -- <em>UBS -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, hello, everyone. Wanted to shift gears quickly to the analytic side. I think at the Investor Day that was one of the most aggressive increases in your medium-term guidance. But when I look at the quarter and I know it's one quarter, but I think the subscription growth it was fine, it wasn't great. But it maybe just put that in context what you're seeing out there and what the environment is like for analytics and where that really can ramp as you go through the year?</p>
<p><strong>C.D. Baer Pettit</strong> -- <em>President</em></p>
<p>Hi, Alex, Baer here. So look, I think we've been pretty consistent in how we talk about Analytics over the last number of years which is that we would expect to see a continued increase and the steady increase in the growth rate which I think we've delivered. So that fundamental message hasn't altered. I think the climate in which we're operating is the same as it was a quarter ago. So, I don't think you should read too much into this quarter. I think the strategic message is the same. I think we are confident that our investments are paying off whether they be in technology for Analytics or in fixed income as an example. So the thesis is the same a steady continued growth and the market opportunities including the comments I just made a few moments ago we're very confident about them.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Kramm</strong> -- <em>UBS -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Fair enough. But maybe staying on that business just a couple of follow-ups here. One on the expense side, I mean, it seems like the expenses in analytics have been pretty range bound, so and that's a little bit surprise. Is that an area you didn't highlight it as an area of increased spending while some of the stuff like fixed income is in there. But just wondering if that needs to be a step-up that will a surprise? And then just secondly, little quick on the pricing side in Analytics some discussions we've been having seem to just that you're getting maybe a little bit more aggressive in that business on pricing anything you can flush out on pricing in that business would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>C.D. Baer Pettit</strong> -- <em>President</em></p>
<p>Sure. So two -- on the first point for sure of the three categories I mentioned ES&amp;G fixed income and beyond technology two out of the three are linked to Analytics. Equally we're for sure not planning any surprises on expense growth where we've been extremely disciplined for quite a number of years on Analytics expense growth so you should not expect any surprises there. And equally on pricing I think we have probably starting closer to 18 months ago or so. We started to be more how should I put it direct on looking at those clients where we felt we were delivering more value than we were being paid for and we've been kind of cleaning that up steadily over time and I expect that to continue. But again it's not a seismic change type of thing it's just a continuation of the strategy which we have been communicating now for a few years.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Kramm</strong> -- <em>UBS -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Fair enough. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Manav Patnaik</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yeah, hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask about your thoughts on sort of the competitive landscape on the Analytics side. Obviously there was one acquisition of note in the last couple of months, but just curious, how you guys will characterize that field today?</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>So the -- some of the M&amp;A activity in this space has confirmed finally that the strategy that MSCI created some 15 years ago at the time of the acquisition of Barra and subsequently to the acquisition of RiskMetric is being copied by many other players in the marketplace. So therefore, it's a good testament that what we started to build many, many years ago is working well and that is the conversion that is taking place in the world. Secondly, we have a relatively large, large lead in working through that strategy of integrating content off indices, content of analytics such as factors for example in equity or fixed income, content obviously in ESG and then delivering that through either Analytics solutions or through index solutions think of them as portfolio solutions right to our clients.</p>
<p>So we have quite a lead and we intend to remain the leader in the marketplace even though obviously there will be more actors in the space and there will be more competition. I think, we believe that this is going to be a big business made up of bigger companies as opposed to the (inaudible) small players in the marketplace. And we are -- we welcome competition, it makes everyone good and we intend to win in the context of that company landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Manav Patnaik</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. And just in terms of your latest thoughts on how active you guys are in terms of your own M&amp;A pipeline, obviously in terms of all of these other alternative areas you're growing in there must be a bunch of niche things you can add on. So, I'm just curious if you could update us on where you guys stand there?</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Yes, so we see pretty much everything that is up there for sale and we engage in some deeper due diligence installment not in orders, everything that we want to do has to have a very strong and strategic logic that is an extension of what we do rather than go sort of greenfield. And secondly, an extremely importantly has to be predicated on very strong financial returns. And given the frothiness of the markets right now given the heat in this space and the willingness of players to throw a lot of money adding incredible evaluations with what we believe to be relatively low or negative financial returns. We are happy to stand out and let them take it. Let them take those companies. And the other thing about MSCI is that we really don't have to do a lot of the things. And so a lot of this incremental acquisitions are really optional. So we'll continue to look and see what we find but it's got to be landed on very strong strategic logic and a strong financial return.</p>
<p><strong>Manav Patnaik</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>All right. Got it. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>Manav, the only point I would add on that is and we've talked about that this in the past. Inorganic growth through partnership continues to be an attractive area for us. And so we're spending an increasing amount of time working with some of those technology and unique content providers as you alluded to as a way to enhance everything we do today and broaden what we do today. So it's not always about owning outright or controlling some of these properties to get access to some of the key capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Manav Patnaik</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. Thanks, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Hugh Miller with Buckingham. You may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Hugh Miller</strong> -- <em>Buckingham -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to start one on as we think about the free cash flow of the business obviously very strong the equity position that you're currently at right now and the stock's evaluation where it is now. How do we think about kind of the appetite for share buybacks in the near term?</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Yes. So as we repeatedly saying for quite a number of years. We once believe that the long-term prospects of MSCI are enormous and therefore the potential for high evaluations that remains there. On a more short-term and tactical basis we are opportunistic buyers of our stock not because we don't see value here and there it's just we will rather buy or we miss than on richness and we have proven that formula has worked. Last year we bought $950 million or so at an average price of $147. We did a little bit -- very, very beginning of this quarter $102 million at an average price of $148. So, we have been patience buyers of our stock and pounce when the -- when others are fearful and stand out when others are greedy.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>The only other variable to factor in here is our cash position which on the heels of other repurchases that Henry alluded to plus the first quarter which is always a light cash flow quarter for us. Our cash balance has come down to somewhere in the $650 million range which means we have a more modest amount of cash still a meaningful amount, but not as much as we used to. And so we can be a little bit more opportunistic.</p>
<p><strong>Hugh Miller</strong> -- <em>Buckingham -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Sure. Very fair point. I appreciate the color there. And then I guess as follow up as we think about kind of the advances that you're making with MSCI beyond, how do we think about kind of the monetization of that enhancement? Is that primarily a driver of kind of the ability to increase prices? Or is it more of an increased adoption with internet clients as you get more people potentially using the platform and the product or would just like a new client penetration just with the stronger platform?</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Yes. Well for sure it is -- it's a large opportunity with our existing clients. So as you know many of our clients use a variety of our content and applications and bring these together through many of their internal tools and beyond will significantly improve the user experience and the flexibility in that regard. So we think that with our existing clients there's a lot of upside. Equally the tool, the product will create a very attractive user experience which we think will win new clients to MSCI and we are seeing some early evidence of that as well. So, I think really what it is -- it's an enhancement to our overall Analytics strategy for existing and new clients and also a very attractive distribution tool for all of our MSCI content.</p>
<p><strong>Hugh Miller</strong> -- <em>Buckingham -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Just a quick follow-up, if I may. Is there a time frame that we should be thinking about in terms of broad rollout event?</p>
<p><strong>C.D. Baer Pettit</strong> -- <em>President</em></p>
<p>Yes. Well, this year we're rolling out the product for equities and have a pretty aggressive time line for getting the full range of MSCI equity functionality on to the platform. And starting next year the multi-asset class capabilities will start to be rolled out. And so that's really kind of the plan, equities this year, multi-asset class next year and from that way forward.</p>
<p><strong>Hugh Miller</strong> -- <em>Buckingham -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Henry Chien with BMO.</p>
<p><strong>Henry Chien</strong> -- <em>BMO -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, good morning, guys. I just had a question on some of the trends that you're seeing on ESG. I mean it sounds like there's a -- if I'm thinking about it correctly there's a sense of insourcing from the asset owners as well as growth in the wealth manager side. I was just wondering if you could describe a little bit more how MSCI fits into this new world of ESG. Is it just index data? Or are you taking more of an active role in the investment?</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>So we are clearly early in the process of sustainable investing in the world. At MSCI we believe that over a period of time it's also this sustainable investment processes will become totally part of the mainstream process. So it will converge a blur ESG sustainable investing into the mainstream investing so that there will come a point in which investing or whether it will capture sustainable investing in addition tool, think of it as financial investing or only looking at financial metrics of investing right?</p>
<p>So, secondly MSCI is a clear leader in providing research guidance tools of all types from research for exclusions or to ratings, to indices, risk models and all delivering in various platform of MSCI plus other platforms in the world. We intend to be all lower this opportunity we think it's a very significant one at MSCI. We have the organizational structure, we have the technology, we have the data science a big part of all of this is capturing the right data not only company-reported data, but a lot of data from all over the world on structure or structured data. So the scalability of this product line is something that we're very focused on and very confident about.</p>
<p>So and lastly we are called upon by asset owners and asset managers all over the world to be -- to help them think through this and to help them figure out how an asset owners will incorporate this, then they're going to do it rating by rating, they're not speaking stock so that's more of a portfolio decision. So this is where indices comment, interactive managers are trying to incorporate this in a day-to-day stock or bond picking process. So we work with them on that.</p>
<p>Risk managers are trying to understand how to manage risk in their portfolios. So this is where the ESG and Factor models comes in and all of that. So, I could tell you that five years ago maybe 10%, 15% of my dialogue with senior clients with ESG. Today, I always have to leave the ESG discussion to the second half of the meeting because if I start with that that's all within I'll talk about in the whole meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Henry Chien</strong> -- <em>BMO -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you for the color.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. You may proceed. (Operator Instructions)</p>
<p><strong>Chris Shutler</strong> -- <em>William Blair -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>No, hi, guys, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>C.D. Baer Pettit</strong> -- <em>President</em></p>
<p>Yes, we can hear you, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Shutler</strong> -- <em>William Blair -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Sorry about that. At Investor Day you mentioned asset manager centralizing their procurement efforts around indices and analytics products. What inning do you think that centralization trend is in? How should we think about the pros and cons of centralized procurement for MSCI?</p>
<p><strong>C.D. Baer Pettit</strong> -- <em>President</em></p>
<p>Look I think it's, I think we're good part of the way there just purely from like the administrative point of view. So I would say that in the last number of years we've seen that centralized procurement has always existed to a degree. It's been strengthened in the last number of years and I think we're pretty much there i.e. I think there are relatively few firms where -- just investment teams make those decisions on their own at least within larger asset managers. So, I think, it's well-established I think we're comfortable in dealing with it so in that sense I don't think it's a change which will have much of a material impact going forward. It's kind of an established pattern that we're working with.</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>So we also create anticipated this trend from four, five years ago. As you may remember we said in Investor Day in other form. We have built MSCI in all the product line largely on the basis of a subject matter expert at MSCI talking to the user at the client of the active manager and then the user going at the hierarchy to get approval of the budget for them to buy the product for the service. So that's how we were building and we've done very well with that process and we'll continue to do well. But about four or five years ago we anticipate that this change -- this pressure on the business model of active managers obviously because we're in that part we were part of the entity putting the pressure on the passive activities.</p>
<p>So we developed this top-down approach of covering the client that they should go to the bottom up with the Senior Account Managers going to -- and you know people like Baer, myself, Laurent Seyer going to the CEO and the CIOs and the CROs so that we can capture the part of that budget that is no longer controlled by the users of the middle manager. A lot of the budget in this active managers organizations that are being centralized are being determined in terms of their allocation by it's C-level people. So we need to have a seat on the table as to how that's get allocated and for MSCI to help them spend that money right.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Shutler</strong> -- <em>William Blair -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks. And then you mentioned the incremental investment in fixed income just maybe a little bit more detail there would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>C.D. Baer Pettit</strong> -- <em>President</em></p>
<p>Sure. So, it's quite relatively straightforward. So we have been really enhancing a lot of our modeling in fixed income, for example, in asset-backed securities and other areas of that kind we're putting more investments also into fixed-income indexes notably factor indexes, there's actually an overlap with the ES&amp;G as we're doing a lot of rating of fixed income instruments and issuers in ES&amp;G. So those are some of the main buckets of fixed income investing that we're doing.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Shutler</strong> -- <em>William Blair -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Warmington</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good morning, everyone. So the Q1 net subscription sales was very strong and combined with the favorable cancellation rate gave you very impressive net new up 34%. And that's particularly strong for Q1, and I wanted to ask if there was pull forward is on demand there? Or whether that is -- that strength is something that we can expect to continue for the next few quarters?</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>Bill as you know Q1 of 2018 was relatively light in general with Q1s that tend to be pretty light for us. And so that gave us firstly a relatively easy comp. On the growth rate, to your point timing of sales particularly some of the larger ones as well as cancels on the net new site can have a factor in any given quarter. And as I mentioned in my remarks we were successful in this quarter in closing a lot of the deals in our pipeline. And so I'd say my broad comments would be quarter-to-quarter as you've seen in the past sales and cancels tend to be a little bit lumpy.</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Bill, I would add to Andy's comment is that, if you (inaudible) MSCI the last few years is we are doing more with the largest asset managers and largest asset owners on banks in the world. Secondly, our sales have gotten to a higher median of price not price, but total value for sure in Analytics a bit increasing this on index and in ESG. So therefore if that trend continues in which we're doing a lot more with the biggest clients of the world which have deep pockets and we're selling them more things at much higher dollar -- total dollar amounts is relative to the base of sales whether if we put $5 million into one quarter at the end versus the $5 million that goes into the next quarter as an example it's going to determine whether it's incredibly strong quarter or an average quarter.</p>
<p>So we want to stretch over and over again to you that there will be lumpiness in quarter-to-quarter more so from -- a little more so than in the past. We want to be very open and transparent with you as to how we see the pipeline and whether it's something to worry about or something that is weakening or something that is strengthening. So that you look at the thing on aggregated version of a few quarters at a time at rolling quarters because if not you're going to take a strong quarter and extrapolate that we're not going to cover up the ball and you're going to take an average quarter and say things are slowing down and that may end up being the wrong conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Warmington</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>For my follow-up question you'd highlighted ESG wealth in Asia as the area is growing above 12% organically. And I wanted to ask specifically about wealth management segment there. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the pipeline of opportunities there? And had been a place where you were investing in technology and had you gotten your system to the point where you feel you can and are winning net new business there with new clients?</p>
<p><strong>C.D. Baer Pettit</strong> -- <em>President</em></p>
<p>Sure. So I think most of the wealth sales that we're seeing are very much content led which can be -- which is in index in ES&amp;G and other areas and including I would say that, if we're using our definition which we've been consistent about content in Analytics being our models and those type of capabilities that's really what's continuing to drive our wealth growth. So at present we are not in the process of designing a wealth-specific new application or product in that sense. But we do think that in addition to enriching all of our content we have -- we will have both one -- in investments in client coverage which are extremely important. We've invested for example in client coverage of wealth in EMEA and Europe to mirror what we've done successfully in the U.S. And we also think that our new platform will give us openings into wealth going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>And just so you have the stats Bill because I know we've given them in the past. The index subscription run rate to the wealth segment was 22% and within ESG it's in the high 20%. And so we continue to get some very strong momentum in those key content areas within the wealth segment.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Warmington</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. Well, thank you very much and also congratulations to Linda and Andy on the new roles.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>Linda H. Riefler</strong> -- <em>Independent Director</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Drew Schneider</strong> -- <em>Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, this is Drew coming on for Joe. Just one question for me. I was wondering if you could talk about any shift you're seeing in the demand environment? Obviously with a lot of volatility in Q4. And then the strong market rebound in Q1 just in to get any kind of sense you guys have about AUM shifting and what you expect moving forward?</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>So let me address the overall market environment and then Andy can provide a little more granularity on the AUM and ETF, right. So on the market environment, we made a conscious decisions in the second half of last year that going into 2019 we did not believe that the world was going to continue to slow down dramatically or going to rotation and that the market environment was going to be bad. So therefore, we created a budget that was an operating plan that was proactive in order to capitalize on a lot of the opportunities in 2019 (ph). We obviously have what we call an upturn playbook and a downturn playbook. The downturn playbook means that if things get bad we have a lot of levers to slow down investments and therefore a slow down EBITDA expenses.</p>
<p>And in an upturn environment we have a plan very explicit plan which Baer alluded to which is we can add a small amount of incremental investment to capitalize on those opportunities. So far it's playing out exactly as we said. The correction in the fourth quarter was completely -- of a reaction by the market we took advantage of that in our buyback. We kept our budget and our operating plan in place. The market environment is pretty benign to us. It's not galloping up or anything like that but it's good. And therefore we want to continue to capitalize on that and you see that in the subscription run rate the organic subscription run rate. Now the ETF it obviously there's a lot of shift back and forth. But Andy you want to provide some comments on the ETF and AUM?</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>Yes. I would just highlight firstly before I touch on the AUM the retention rate in the quarter you probably saw was 95.2% which is close to the if not the lowest rate we've had in the first quarter. And so I think that's reflective of kind of the environment that we're seeing or at least the demand for our tools. On the AUM side clearly you saw that over the last quarter the AUM has gone up for us over $100 billion, $28 billion of that was in inflows. And so we definitely benefited from market appreciation but the inflows look pretty healthy from our perspective. That $28 billion was about 70% of all the inflows during the quarter into ETFs.</p>
<p>I think a lot of that was driven by as we talked about on the prepared remarks. We definitely saw some strength into ESG and Factor products as well as U.S. exposure products particularly our Factor U. S. exposure products. We also saw of that $28 billion about $15 billion went into emerging market exposure ETFs. And the bulk of that was in the broad emerging market products and that came from both U.S. and European-listed products. So, I think part of the benefit was a little bit of a rotation back into emerging markets which naturally we benefit from. But I think a lot of it was idiosyncratic to us based on some of the newer high-growth areas like factors in ESG.</p>
<p><strong>Drew Schneider</strong> -- <em>Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Perfect. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Huber</strong> -- <em>Huber Research Partners -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thank you. My first question -- your subscription part of your business within indexes up a very strong 12.8% year-over-year. Can you just break apart for us the volume component of that versus pricing year-over-year?</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>Yes. So, I'd say it's very consistent with what we've seen in the past. So about a one-three roughly or even less than a one-third of the growth is coming from price increases, but we continue to fuel that growth mainly through volume. And so we continue to see strong healthy in the key areas of growth for us. So I mentioned already the subscription run rate growth from ESG Indexes of 53% for our Factor index, Factor module it's 40%, our custom module 19%. And so these have continued to be key growth areas for us.</p>
<p>I'd say from a client segment standpoint we are continuing to get strong traction in some of these new not I'd say higher growth client segments like wealth and asset owners we're among wealth managers as I alluded to 22% subscription run rate growth and asset owners at 27%. And so those are areas where we continue to see a long runway of growth and continue to fuel keep that elevated subscription run rate growth.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Huber</strong> -- <em>Huber Research Partners -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>And then my follow-up question on the cost side of things. How would you categorize the labor market right now in terms of wage inflation out there? I know when you're out in the marketplace trying to hire you've always valued high end well-educated folks. But is there any extra upward transaction of wages you have to pay to attract folks, maybe out of the ordinary here.</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Not really, we at MSCI benefit enormously by the global footprint of operations that we have. We have offices in 21 countries. As you saw in the reported material we already are at 62% of our total employee base in emerging market centers from 59% at this time last year. So, when we clearly are in a competitive market, but we can shift where we locate people in a lot of different locations and make sure that we get attractive best talent possible. So that has not changed that much even though in the U.S. which is remember we only have about 700 and changed 700 may be 50 people in the U.S. compared to over 3,100 people that we have globally.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. You may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Keith Housum</strong> -- <em>Northcoast Research -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good morning. Congratulations, Andy and Linda. First question I has to do regarding I guess the retention rate being as good as it is. I understand that MSCI has done a lot things to making yourselves more important to customer. But are you also seeing stabilization in the overall market?</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Yes. I think that the retention rate on index has always been very strong and we plan to make -- take steps to make it even stronger right. ESG it was fairly the retention rate was fairly high and as the -- if run rate grows on ESG it's obviously gone not be as high, but within a high definition right -- of similar to index for example. On Analytics a lot of the efforts that we have put in place in last 18 months have been to significantly increase our servicing capabilities to the client. Our Analytics product line is made up of a lot of content that needs to be understood how to use that content and then these technologies that enables that content. Think of them as the platform the technology our applications platform that enable that content.</p>
<p>So what we have found is that a lot of clients have this incredibly sophisticated content and tools, but they are only using a small part of it, and that sometimes will then lead to cancellations. So we have a strong push in helping clients understand how they can use it more broadly, deeper in their organization and that will mitigate cancel. Having said all of that, renewal rate and cancels will be lumpy particularly in Analytics. There will be some quarters that it's going to appear a little higher and there are some quarters that appear a little lower. We will endeavor to tell you whether you worry about which you worry about not worry about, but it is important to extrapolate on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It's always better to take two, three quarters in aggregate and see where the trend is moving.</p>
<p><strong>Keith Housum</strong> -- <em>Northcoast Research -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up question. The tax rate for the quarter is obviously really low even outside of the -- stock option units. Was there any drivers of that? And I guess to the -- I believe that the guys have taken that a little bit on the topside for the rest of the year. I guess what's driving the tax rate, I guess lower than expectations?</p>
<p><strong>Andrew C. Wiechmann</strong> -- <em>Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer</em></p>
<p>Yes. It was almost entirely driven by the windfall benefits we saw in the first quarter and divesting of stock-based compensation. So even outside of the multi-year award vesting which we're excluding from the adjusted EPS tax rate the normal course stock-based compensation windfall benefit was higher than what we've seen in the past largely driven by just the strong stock price performance. So it was close to $10 million windfall benefit that we saw outside of that multiyear benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Keith Housum</strong> -- <em>Northcoast Research -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our Q&amp;A portion of today's conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jay Penn for any closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Penn</strong> -- <em>Interim Head of Investor Relations</em></p>
<p>So, Henry you can actually...</p>
<p><strong>Henry A. Fernandez</strong> -- <em>Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director</em></p>
<p>Yes I'd just like to conclude by saying that you're probably noticed that we put in early in the slides, in the website, but we also put in a first quarter update that a few pages that goes over a review of the strategy that we went through Investor Day and I did a little bit of that in my comments. Some more the client wins and where things stands on the client side, some of the product introductions that we did in the quarter and an a little bit on the inside MSCI internally what are the things that we're working on that resilient to the quarter. We did that in an effort to limit the prepared remarks so that you could read them ahead of time and then we can spend a lot more time on Q&amp;A. We like to continue to push that envelope further in order to allow for a lot more discussion and lot more answer to your questions as opposed to all of us sitting in a conference call reading the prepared remarks. So please give us a lot of feedback into that, what for you, what doesn't and like to make sure that we calibrate this correctly. Back over to you Jay.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Penn</strong> -- <em>Interim Head of Investor Relations</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Henry. Just want to thank everyone for joining the call today. Really appreciate the continued support and look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. Have a great day.</p>
