</section><h2>Prepared Remarks:</h2>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Good morning and afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's CNH Industrial 2019 First Quarter Results Conference Call. For your information, today's conference call is being recorded. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Federico Donati, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p><strong>Federico Donati</strong> -- <em>Head of Global Investor Relations</em></p><p>Thank you, Jenny. And good morning and afternoon, everyone. We would like to welcome you to the CNH Industrial first quarter 2019 result webcast conference call. This call is being broadcasted live on our website and is copyrighted by CNH Industrial. Any other use recording or transmission of any portion of this broadcast without the expressed written consent of CNH Industrial is strictly forbidden.</p><p>We are pleased to have a year with us today CNH Industrial CEO, Hubertus Muhlhauser; and CFO, Max Chiara who will be hosting today's call. They will use the material, you may download from the CNH Industrial website. After their presentation, we would be holding a Q&amp;A session.</p><p>As a final comment, please note that any forward-looking statement, we might be making during today's call are subject to the risk and uncertainties mentioned in the Safe Harbor statement included in the presentation material. Additional information pertaining to factors that could cause actual results to be differ materially is contained in the Company's most recent report 20-F and EU annual report as well as other periodic reports and filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and equivalent authorities in the Netherlands and in Italy.</p><p>The company presentation may include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information, including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the presentation material. As a reminder, please note that starting from Q1 2019 onwards, we have updated the geographical composition of our regional sales information as indicated in the supporting materials of this earning release, consistent with the new jack organization.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Hubertus.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Thank you, Federico, and good morning and good afternoon to Europe to everyone. While many of us felt and clearly hope that some of the uncertainties that are unfortunately impacting our markets globally would have subsided by now, in most cases they have not. Regardless, we set a clear direction for ourselves at the beginning of the year and our relentless execution allowed us to print a record net income first quarter to start 2019 off on the right foot.</p><p>Before digging into the quarterly highlights, I'd like to thank our almost 65,000 employees, not only for their commitment and endurance in delivering a strong quarter, but also because many of them are in parallel actively contributing in the preparation of our new strategic business plan with the objective to transform our company from good to great.</p><p>Turning to the first quarter highlights. Industrial activities net sales were up almost 2% in constant currencies and adjusted EBIT was up 7% with operating margin increasing by 50 bps. We had a record first quarter in terms of adjusted net income at $248 million and adjusted diluted EPS, up almost 30% to $0.18 per share.</p><p>Additionally, net industrial debt was at $1.5 billion, up $900 million from December 31st of 2018 due to normal seasonality in working capital as we start the year, but down $400 million from the same quarter a year ago. Finally, on the back of our first quarter's good performance, we are reaffirming our financial targets for 2019, which I would go through toward the end of the prepared remarks.</p><p>Moving on to slide 4, let me provide you with a high level industry update for Q1.</p><p>First, I'd like to highlight that in the ag segment, Northern America row crop sector continues to trend positively with good performances as customers replaced dated equipment especially in combines with the market in the first quarter up almost 30% . EU tractor demand was up this quarter by 12% with combines down almost 20% due to the spill over impact from extremely dry weather conditions suffered in Central and Northern Europe during the last harvest season.</p><p>South America combines were also very strong, up almost 40%, driven by Brazil. While Argentina was down year-over-year. Before I touch on the construction segment. I'd like to point out that we have slightly changed the way we characterize this business. While we historically broke it out by heavy and light, we believe it is more helpful to talk about the equipment based on their end-user application. Going forward, we will refer to them as compact and service equipment which includes mainly the lighter compact and service equipment like skid steer loaders and tractor loader backhoe and general construction equipment, which includes crawler excavators and wheel loaders and road building and site preparation, which includes compaction, dozers, and graders.</p><p>Generally speaking, construction end-markets are developing in line with what we anticipated at the beginning of the year but with North America on the lower end of the range. The South American volumes have been slow in Q1, but we expect that financing incentives will continue to be available going forward and should support a strengthening market.</p><p>For trucks, the European truck market was up 8% year-over-year with light duty trucks up 11%, while medium and heavy was up 4%. However, our core markets, Italy and Spain were down 13% and 2% respectively.</p><p>South America was up 17% with Brazil up 52% and Argentina down 52%. As well please remember that while the Brazil figures seems large, this is still coming off the significant downturn that started in 2014, but we see promising future volumes as order intake is up 50% from last year.</p><p>For buses, the European market was relatively flat this quarter, but we were able to add 240 bps in our market share and we now represent almost a fifth of the market. South America was quite strong for buses in the quarter and our backlog of orders mainly minibuses is building as well. Overall, while there have been some weaknesses during the last quarter in certain markets like European combines in South American construction equipment, the key markets for us were generally positive in the quarter. We will go into this in more detail later in the call.</p><p>At this point. I'll now hand it over to Max for the financial overview of the presentation, Max?</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>Thank you Hubertus and good morning, or afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. As a general remark, despite the uncertain industry scenario in agriculture and the volatile and generally weak economic activity in certain high growth markets, we were able to achieve our expectations and closed the quarter with an improved operating margin on the back of a sustained performance across our portfolio with continued to focus to drive cost discipline in our operations.</p><p>Moving now to slide 5 and the key figures for the first quarter. Net sales in our industrial segments were down 5% reported and up nearly 2% in constant currency, with currency translation impact primarily due to the weakening of the euro and the Brazilian real, more than offsetting the strong price realization performance in excess of 3% in agriculture and construction and sales volume improvements in commercial and specialty vehicles with increased deliveries in light duty trucks and in buses in Europe and Brazil.</p><p>Adjusted EBIT was up 7% in the quarter. We had a record first quarter adjusted net income of $248 million, up 22% from Q1, 2018 as we continue to make improvement in our interest and tax expense lines and resulted in an adjusted EPS up $0.04 to $0.18 per share. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 26%, flat from Q1 2018 and we expect it to be at 27% for the full year 2019.</p><p>Net industrial debt increased to $1.5 billion, up $900 million versus year-end as a result of normal seasonality in working capital in the first quarter as we ramp up our industrial machine in preparation of the spring season. Despite the higher net industrial debt this is $400 million better than one year ago.</p><p>Available liquidity was $10 billion, up $1.1 billion compared to year-end 2018, primarily as a result of the new revolving credit facility executed in the first quarter, which I will discuss later. The liquidity to revenue ratio further improved to (ph) 24% with third-party gross industrial debt to EBITDA ratio at 2 times, down from 2.4 times last year. This performance coupled with increased liquidity buffer is a continuous and clear sign that we fully committed to further improving our credit ratings from the current levels, as well as reiterating our goal of achieving a net industrial debt free position.</p><p>Turning to slide 6, let's discuss the first quarter performance in our industrial activities net sales excluding now the impact of foreign exchange translation. As said, for the quarter, net sales in constant currency in our industrial activities increased $170 million or 1.9%. Agricultural equipment contributed $45 million as a result of price realization performance achieved across all regions offset by volume and mix. Construction equipment sales decreased net of $16 million or 2% primarily due to selected inventory destocking actions in our North American dealer network, partially offset by a strong price realization of more than 10%. Commercial and specialty vehicle sales increased $134 million or 5% on higher industry volume and favorable product mix in light commercial vehicles and in buses in Europe.</p><p>Powertrain was down $68 million or 6% year-over-year due to lower sales volume as a result of the strong 2018 year-end activity. In terms of regional segment mix for the quarter it was largely unchanged from last year.</p><p>Turning to slide 7 now with an overview of our operating results by driver for the business as a whole. Industrial activities' adjusted EBIT improved on a year-over-year basis 50 bps in the quarter or was up 6.5% on the back of increased deliveries in commercial and specialty vehicles and thanks to the pricing performance offsetting the cost headwinds coming primarily from the lagging effect of raw material cost increases in our procurement contracts. And the impact from the US tariffs enactment on Section 301 introduced in 2018.</p><p>Discipline in our structural cost was maintained throughout the quarter, while product development spending toward the next generation equipment continued to increase as expected, achieving now in aggregate a 4% plus figure over net sales, with a focus on digital and connected vehicles and regulatory capital associated with the transition to Stage V in Europe.</p><p>In addition, financial services results were slightly down in the quarter as a result of lower interest spreads. From a consolidated view, EBIT closed with a margin of 6.3%, up 30 bps year-over-year.</p><p>On slide 8 now with the view by segment of the gross margin and the EBIT contribution. All segments with the exception of commercial and specialty vehicles which was flat, delivered an increased gross margin on the back of a solid performance with (inaudible) and powertrain highlighting an improvement of more than 200 bps. Ag gross margin was up 40 bps on the back of a strong price realization, more than offsetting raw material headwinds.</p><p>Our adjusted EBITDA ended up slightly down year-over-year due to a lower G&amp;A primarily due to a negative FX impact, and as a result of reduced penetration of truck sales with buyback commitment in commercial and specialty vehicles realized during the last few quarters, inconsistency with the previously announced refocusing strategy to more profitable market segments and to alternative propulsion engines. The adjusted EBITDA margin was flat at 8.7% in Q1 2019.</p><p>Turning now to the individual segment performance on slide 9, agricultural equipment net sales at constant currency increased on the back of strong price realization across all geographies. Since volume improved from end user replacement demand in the North American raw crop sector and from sustained demand in Brazil, but were offset by a general slowdown of activity in Turkey, and by extremely dry weather affecting harvest conditions in Australia.</p><p>Worldwide deliveries were down 2% in tractors, and up 1% in combines versus last year and production was down 4%. Worldwide inventory in units was up 16% in tractors and down 5% in combines. In the row crop sector in North America, the segment over produced retail low double digits in the quarter to support the upcoming spring selling season. This segment closed the first quarter with an adjusted EBITDA of $168 million down $18 million from last year.</p><p>In the quarter, the agricultural segments accelerated investment in its precision farming platform and in the introduction of Stage V emission requirement compliant engine applications, driving the segment development spending up by 19%, compared to the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the increase in R&amp;D expenses, the segment performance improved as a result of the significant price realization achieved, more than offsetting the anticipated raw material headwinds and the implications from the enactment of the US tariffs regime.</p><p>As a result, adjusted EBIT margin ended down 50 bps to 6.7% in the first quarter of 2019 while gross margin was up by 40 bps. Looking forward, farmers muted sentiments from trade tensions, coupled with the slow start to the spring planting season in North America due to wet and cold weather, are delaying decision of restart of activity in the early part of the second quarter. Ultimately, this may reverse toward the end of the second quarter with a squeezed planting window.</p><p>Activity remained stable across the major European markets, while there run out of the Brazilian subsidized funding scheme total capacity ahead of the new program announcement is causing volatility in retail demand. More recently at the Agri show in Brazil, Brazilian authorities confirmed that the 2019-2020 funding scheme would be officially announced in early June. For the current 2019 crop, additional funding was in the meantime allocated to (inaudible). This is positive news to the market and definitely a good support for our South American operations during this transition period.</p><p>Limited improvement from the low level of activity still in Q1 are expected for the second quarter in the Australian and Turkish agricultural markets as the comparison to prior year remains tough. Given the current scenario and considering a year-over-year order book lower comparatively with high order figures in the second quarter of 2018, the segment activity is expected to remain challenging for Q2 with a possible shift in mix toward the lower end of the product range, as sentiment remains on hold.</p><p>Turning to slide 10, construction equipment and sales decreased 2% on a constant currency basis, mainly due to selective inventory destocking actions in our North American dealer network while activity was basically flat year-over-year in the other geographies and was partially offset by the strong price realization of 3% plus. Worldwide deliveries were down 9% with compact equipment down 11%, general construction's up 1% and road and site down 8%.</p><p>Worldwide production was flat versus last year with compact equipment down 8% to general construction up 37% and road and sites down 10%, Inventory was up 22%. This is again a normal trend in the segment with production restart in the first quarter replenishing low year-end inventory levels.</p><p>Adjusted EBIT was $13 million in Q1 with an adjusted EBIT margin of 2%. The 200 bps increase in the profit performance was a result of net price realization across the product portfolio and production efficiencies more than offseting raw material and tariff headwinds. The construction segment is accelerating on its 80:20 program effort and after having identified the areas of focus around product line simplification and SKU reduction on one hand, and customer line simplification geared at streamlining and strengthening its distribution network on the other hand is now moving into execution mode with early results expected to start rolling out in the second part of 2019. Later in the presentation, Hubertus will provide more of a general framework on how we intend to rollout the initiative across our major businesses.</p><p>In summary, the segment activity remains healthy across the board. although slightly below our initial expectations in North America and with a good order coverage for the second quarter.</p><p>On slide 11 now with commercial and specialty vehicles. Net sales were up 5% on a constant currency basis, benefiting from higher industry volume and favorable product mix in light commercial vehicles and in buses in Europe. Trucks worldwide production was down 10% versus last year primarily in medium and heavy trucks with company inventory units down 9%.</p><p>Light duty truck deliveries were up 9% and buses were up 13% in Europe, while medium and heavy instead were down 27%. The decline in heavy vehicle deliveries in Europe is attributable to the previously announced strategy shift, which focuses sales on a more profitable product portfolio including LNG and CNG vehicles.</p><p>Specifically for the natural gas initiative, the mix shift toward natural gas engines throughout the group continues, supported by solid demand in the sub-segment. As predicted, gas penetration within Europe for the industry grew toward 2% of total industry volume in Q1 and is projected to increase further. Our year-over-year run rate order book for medium and heavy LNG CNG duty trucks in Europe was up around 60% and our market share in Europe is stabilizing to about 60% as new entrants are coming into the market.</p><p>As a result, gas penetration for (inaudible) vehicles is now at 15% of its total retail performance and growing. The market share for trucks in Europe was 10.4%, down 1.2 percentage point in part driven by the decline of the market in Italy and Spain, countries where notably we retain a leadership position. Trucks book to bill was at 1.19 in Europe and 0.93 in South America with order book in Brazil up 50% from last year, starting from a very low base.</p><p>Buses market share in Europe was 18.5%, up 240 bps versus last year. Book-to-bill was at 1.24 in Europe and 1 in South America. Adjusted EBIT was $51 million in Q1, slightly up compared to $49 million in the first quarter of 2018. Positive volume in light trucks and buses, favorable product mix and positive underlying price performance were almost offset by negative foreign exchange transaction and year-over-year hedge impacts, higher production cost, including negative absorption from lower volume in our medium and heavy duty operations and increased product development spending. Adjusted EBIT margin was 2.1% in the first quarter of 2019. The cumulative reduction in units sold under buyback commitment since the start of the strategy shift at the beginning of last year is proceeding in line with our plan.</p><p>Although we expect a seasonal pickup in business activity in Q2 versus Q1, order books in Europe are mixed with light duty trucks holding well at high levels and medium and heavy down double-digit by design in diesel applications and up more than 60% in natural gas applications.</p><p>On slide 12 now, powertrain net sales decreased 6% on a constant currency basis versus last year due to lower sales volume as a result of the strong 2018 year-end activity. Sales to standard customers accounted for 47% of total net sales. Segment activity remained strong with volume expected to increase in the second quarter, sequentially up 10% from Q1. Adjusted EBIT was $96 million this quarter with favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies offset by increased selling expense to support the segment marketing activity to develop third-party business and higher product development spending. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 130 bps to 9.3% in the quarter, which represents an historical first quarter record for the segment.</p><p>Moving on to slide 13 and our financial services business. The financial services segment has performed at healthy levels in the quarter. Retail loan originations achieved $2.2 billion, flat compared to last year at incurred rate and up $100 million at constant currency, primarily North America. The managed portfolio of more than $26 billion at quarter end was up $1.2 billion versus one year ago at constant currency, with the bulk of the increase in South America and the Rest of the World.</p><p>Overall penetration is relatively flat on a year-over-year basis with strength in our established market, North America and Europe offset by the ramp up of our new India captive business in the hydro (ph) plant. From a performance point of view, Q1 2019 net income was $95 million, a decrease of 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reduced interest spreads, partially offset by improved cost of risk and operating lease performance as well as higher average portfolio in South America and Rest of the World region.</p><p>On a profit before tax basis, this represents a return on assets of about 2%, in line with historical performance. Importantly, credit quality performance remained healthy with delinquencies tracking at 3.4%, down 20 bps versus one year ago. In closing, the financial services segment goal of supporting the sales of CNH Industrial while adequately remunerating its own capital remains an underpinning of our portfolio strategy.</p><p>Moving on to slide 14, I'd like to discuss our net industrial debt and net industrial cash flow performance and provide an update on the balance sheet. Net industrial debt of $1.5 billion at the end of March 2019 increased by $900 million from December 31st, 2018 as a result of typical seasonality and working capital in the first quarter.</p><p>Let's discuss this working capital change in more detail. Main driver of the cash usage was the build up of inventories of about $1 billion in the quarter, of which about $400 million related to the restart of the industrial plant machine after the year-end shutdown, and about $600 million in finished goods in our different businesses. The main reasons for the increase in finished goods include a normal buildup in inventory, primarily in agriculture in anticipation of the spring selling season in the Northern Hemisphere, and in construction and commercial vehicles as a restart from the very low level at year-end. An inventory buffer primarily in finished goods to mitigate the potential risks associated with a no deal Brexit scenario completed the impact.</p><p>From a balance sheet standpoint, we delivered another important milestone this quarter with the successful execution in March of a new EUR4 billion committed revolving credit facility, replacing the existing EUR1.75 billion facility at improved terms. The new credit facility has a five-year plan on with two extension options of one year each, improved pricing and other conditions in light of our three investment grade ratings and expanded the number of participating banks. The successful execution of this deal puts us in a much better liquidity position in light of our credit rating targets.</p><p>In addition, in March, our European (inaudible) vehicle issued EUR600 million of 1.75% notes due 2027 and guaranteed by CNH Industrial N.V. The strong level of available liquidity permits us to look at our capital allocation priorities with a diligent approach to maintaining a solid balance sheet, continuing to invest in organic growth as well as being opportunistic in inorganic growth initiatives while protecting our dividend policy.</p><p>With regards to our dividend, shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on April 12, approved a dividend of EUR1.18 per common share, up 30% versus last year's dividend which was paid on May 2nd, 2019.</p><p>Before concluding on slide 15, I would like to provide an update on our investment program in CapEx and product developments. As previously anticipated, we have been accelerating our product development program which spending up achieving 4% plus of net sales in the quarter while CapEx activities ramping up 26% year-over-year, representing 1.3% of sales in Q1, whereby we're coupling new product spending with investment to upgrade our factories and improve their productivity.</p><p>When looking at the spending in new products, the spending associated with the key mega trends impacting across our industries, digitalization, electrification, autonomous and telematics was up 34% versus last year solid double-digit increases across each category, representing now 50% of our total spending in new product and growing. Stage V and other regulatory program spending account for about a quarter of total spending in new applications. While we remain focused on price and cost discipline, we are encouraged by the positive year-over-year performance of this first quarter, which sets us on track with our financial targets for the year.</p><p>I have concluded my presentation and will turn it back over to Hubertus for the outlook and his final remarks before opening for the Q&amp;A session.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Thank you, Max. Please join me now on slide 17, where we turn to the market outlook for the full year 2019. We need to understand that continued trade and geopolitical issues make it very challenging to precisely predict what will happen this year. While many of us had hoped some of these issues, would have been resolved by now or at least have some more progress, they continue to linger without a near-term resolution. This creates a scenario where upside potential is getting harder to find as we move further through the year. That being said, we are still cautiously optimistic that some of those trade issues will be resolved in the short term and would at least strengthen sentiment in the latter part of this year.</p><p>I won't run through all the segments by region here, but while the outlook for ag is based largely on the current steady state market conditions, comparables as previously stated in the first two quarters of 2019 are challenging. General sentiment of the agricultural end-markets in which we compete remains muted as a result of the uncertainties related to the trade tensions that are still unresolved. The spillover implications of negative weather events in Australia and Northern Europe and the potential for delayed planting in North America due to extreme wet conditions, as well as continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties in Turkey and Argentina.</p><p>On the positive side, reduced levels of used equipment continue to support new sales and precision ag solutions continue to drive adoption of high horsepower equipment for farmers who aim to offset lower commodity prices with higher yields and better sequential farm incomes.</p><p>In terms of construction equipment, we have lowered our outlook from 5% to 10% to 5% in general construction and road building equipment. End-markets in Northern America continue to demonstrate growth driven by solid economic footing and state and local investments in infrastructure. We're calling compact equipment in Northern America as flat based on sluggish housing starts and other mixed indicators that continue to be range bound.</p><p>In South America and Brazil, in particular, we're calling for flat to slightly up generally, as the current geopolitical environment is conducive to recovery, although financing is less attractive than the ag equipment sector. The truck market in Europe for heavy is expected to be flat to slightly down and in light, it is anticipated to be slightly up with positive trends and growing LNG and CNG demand as previously predicted. In the South American market, and particular Brazil here again, demand recovery should continue driven by attractive borrowing rates, old fleet renewals and increased ag rate and hence we are expecting at least 10% growth rates.</p><p>On slide 18, we highlight our guidance for the full year of 2019. We are on track with our profitable growth trajectory and are therefore reaffirming our 2019 guidance as follows. Net sales of industrial activities at approximately $28 billion, modestly up year-over-year, with favorable pricing across segments offsetting raw material headwinds and positive operating margin leverage. Adjusted diluted EPS between $0.84 and $0.88 per share with a growth of between 5% to 10% year-over-year. Net industrial debt at the end of 2019 between $200 million and $400 million moving us closer to a net industrial debt-free position.</p><p>As outlined in February during the 2018 year-end results, I'd like to reiterate the following items. Increased investments in organic growth with CapEx and R&amp;D up year-over-year, reaching 2.5% and 4% respectively of sales. Operating cash flow will be about $200 million higher than in 2018, helping to fund incremental CapEx and dividend versus prior year. And finally, an effective tax rate flat from last year at 27%.</p><p>Now I'd like to discuss a few quarterly highlights in terms of product developments, key product launches for full year 2019, and then I will conclude with a few additional final remarks.</p><p>On slide 20, you can see that we had another great quarter in terms of awards and initiatives. In the area of precision agriculture, we signed a partnership agreement to bring state-of-the-art connectivity to Brazilian agriculture. The company has participated in the creation of ConectarAGRO, a consortium of eight partners from the agri business and telecommunication sectors, whose aim is to bring open connectivity solutions to all the agricultural regions of Brazil.</p><p>Additionally, a memo of understanding for the development of bio-methane and the transport sector in Italy was signed in mid-April by FPT Industrial, New Holland Agriculture and IVECO and Confagricoltura, General Confederation of Italian Agriculture, CIB, the Italian biogas consortium and others to truly enables the circular economy in all the segments we operate in.</p><p>In terms of awards, at the SIMA ag show in Paris, we are proud to see our CASE IH and New Holland teams win four Machine of the Year awards to recognize our investments and innovation. Finally IVECO manufacturing facility in Valladolid, Spain has achieved the Gold status in our world-class manufacturing program, becoming the second site after the Madrid plant to do so.</p><p>Moving to slide 21, I'd like to talk about our new product and concept in this first quarter of the year. As you can see, we had the international launch of the New IVECO Daily van, which will be manufactured at the Gold medal Valladolid plant. The New Daily sets new standards in on board living and driving experience and makes important strides toward autonomous driving and enhanced safety features. During the quarter, we launched 24 new products throughout the group, including the New Daily Minibus takes connectivity to a new level, unlocking a world of highly personalized services precisely tailored to the driver's real use of vehicle and provide a complete transport solution that would change the way to transport passengers.</p><p>The New Daily 4x4 that was introduced last year combines the leading product line up with new off-road and go-anywhere capabilities and some other important new introductions in each of our industrial segment.</p><p>On the digitization front, I'm excited to report that we have a strengthening fleet of connected trucks and we are targeting to get more than 20,000 vehicles connected with the introduction of the model year 2019. This not only allows us to better assist and grow with our customers but feeds real-time data so that we can see the relative trends in our various markets and better forecast where things stand at a given point in the cycle.</p><p>In agriculture, Case IH unveiled new AFS Connect Magnum series tractors giving producers a new way to run their business, with a freedom to adjust, manage, monitor, and transfer data the way they want. In construction equipment, we unveiled our methane-powered wheel loader concept, Project TETRA at bauma and its vision for the future of sustainable construction.</p><p>This project shows how professional construction operators could help spearhead the move away from fossil fuel powered vehicles toward renewable resources by playing a fundamental in the circular economy in which methane-powered wheel loaders helped produce the gas from waste products and renewable sources, which then ultimately powers them.</p><p>This concept follows the methane-powered Concept tractor already mentioned in our full year earnings release that was recognized for its reimagined design features and it's pioneering alternative fuel technology. These two products, as well as the ones already available in the market further demonstrates the depth of our portfolio in alternative propulsion and our dedication to fitting the right solution to the appropriate application and not a one-size-fits-all approach.</p><p>When looking at the CO2 statistics in terms of well-to-wheel bio-methane has more impressive CO2 emission reduction than electric, as it results in more than 100% reduction of emissions contributing in the end in cleaning the environment. We are the leader in LNG, CNG and bio-methane for on-highway applications and see a clear path for adoption for off-highway usage in the future as well.</p><p>Before moving to the next slide, let me remind you that on April 24th, we published a companion guide to our 2018 sustainability report. A Sustainable Year 2018 edition highlights the company's ongoing commitment to sustainability and offers an engaging and visual insight into some of our major achievement within our environmental, social, and governance programs during the past year. I would suggest all of you to take a moment of your time and visit our website to have a look at it.</p><p>Moving now to slide 22, some of the strategic initiatives we have briefly referred to in the past are progressing as expected. Started in January, but continuing throughout the year is the rollout of our new organizational structure. Not only are we looking at increasing the span of control, but also expect to reduce organizational layers to achieve a best-in-class and talented organization that fully shares our objective to become more customer-centric, lean, and agile.</p><p>The world-class manufacturing program continues to deliver year-over-year productivity improvements with associated cost savings at almost 5% in the first quarter. On the back of the success of WCM, we are now applying the same principles in other areas, namely logistics, engineering and finance. Our goal is to achieve similar productivity and quality benefits as we did in manufacturing.</p><p>Our organization is fully embracing the 80:20 methodology. After having started a 80:20 pilot in construction equipment in North America, we will now implement in the first step, a reduction of configurations of 46% starting in Q2. Positive results in construction will be visible in the second half of the year.</p><p>In parallel, we have started the analysis in the agricultural segment and aftermarket segment for both segments in North America and we are currently defining the actions for those businesses. After having trained more than 300 people in the methodology, we are rolling out the principles to other geographic areas and segments.</p><p>Finally, we are analyzing our global manufacturing footprint with early findings expected to be unveiled in connection with our strategic plan presentation at our upcoming Capital Markets Day.</p><p>Moving on to slide 23, we have now defined the date for our Capital Markets Day event. On September 3, we will be presenting our new strategic business plan that we are currently developing under the new leadership structure. The event will take place in New York City at the New York Stock Exchange. On this day, you will not only see our current and future technology displayed, but you will have the chance to meet the global executive team of CNH Industrial. As part of the Capital Markets Day, we will share with you margin targets for our respective segments and most importantly, the strategic initiatives that will get us to those targets over time.</p><p>In addition, we expect to provide the capital markets with an update of our capital allocation principles and to discuss our medium- to long-term view toward the portfolio of our businesses. I'm sure it will be a defining moment in our roadmap to become one of the greatest capital goods companies on the planet.</p><p>I have now completed my presentation and turn it back to Federico.</p><p><strong>Federico Donati</strong> -- <em>Head of Global Investor Relations</em></p><p>Thank you very much Hubertus. This concludes our prepared remarks for the first quarter results, and we can now open up for questions. Jenny, over to you.</p><section class="read-more-section in-content">

</section><h2>Questions and Answers:</h2><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you very much. We'll now take our first question from Evercore from the line of David Raso. Please go ahead.</p><p><strong>David Raso</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p><p>Hi. Thank you. I appreciate with the trade tensions, it's really challenging to forecast the year for agriculture, but I'm just trying to kind of balance the comments on the second quarter. Sound a little more cautious on Ag, but then you look at your industry outlooks for ag and some ups, some down, some maintain. So I'm really trying to figure out is, have you really made any changes to your thoughts on '19 given the trade tensions have dragged on and obviously this week maybe they took another step backwards? And at the same time if you haven't, is there a certain point, be it early order programs, mid-summer when you'd have to really address, if there is no trade resolution, there is a step function change in how you view targeted ending inventories for the year in agriculture? I'm just trying to square it up with all the different commentaries near term, more cautious, but no real change in your industry outlooks in aggregate for ag.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Yes, well I start with the sentiment and then Max takes the inventory question. I think I mean sentiment I said is still muted. Honestly, we don't really know what to take from the tweets over the weekend by the President. But we are still cautiously optimistic that there is going to be a trade deal with China, despite all the posturing in the last days.</p><p>That being said, it's also weather right now that is of a concern, which in agriculture, of course, has an influence. But still, putting all together, we don't want to change yet the industry outlook for the year, as that outlook was based kind of on this scenario of uncertainty. So that's the reason why we're still kind of confident that we can deliver those numbers that we have predicted. And on the inventory side, perhaps you want to say something Max?</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>Sure. So as we started last year, we are continuing to look at destocking inventory in Hay &amp; Forage in North America, although at a milder pace this year. Net-net, we expect the production for the full year to be flat year-over-year from 2019 to 2018 in general. The slight overproduction was just above 10% in the row crop sector for Q1 was expected and is in line with the pickup in activity seasonally, Q1 to Q2. For the full year, we expect to be flat to slightly down in terms of production to retail.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Yes. And I think one thing also needs to be noted. I mean the disastrous -- the tariff discussions are for North America right now and for the world economy, obviously, South America is benefiting from that. And if you basically look at our Brazil business, that's up and driving. I mean order books are up, business is up and as we said continuously, the Brazilian farmers are right now eating the American farmers' lunch. And that's again not in their interest, but for us, it's a hedge that we have there.</p><p><strong>David Raso</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p><p>And could you help us by quantifying the ag order book trends year-over-year?</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>I would say that the comparison is not fair because last year we were ramping up in terms of sentiment Q1 to Q2. So there was an expectation of significant pickup in activity. So when I look at year-over-year they're down but they're still at a very healthy levels. And again, the used inventory in the field is continue to being reduced and that is a good support to demand of new equipment. And actually, pricing on used is also holding up pretty well.</p><p><strong>David Raso</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p><p>Last quick one, on construction, the year-over-year inventory gain. I wasn't sure the inventory year-over-year is up more in construction than it was year-over-year in the fourth quarter.</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>So we reduced dealer inventory --</p><p><strong>David Raso</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p><p>But at the same time -- yes, please go ahead --</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>We reduced dealer inventory in North America by about 700 units, which is $30 million more or less, take it or leave it on compact equipment of revenue. We increased company inventory in the balance of the business and again this is to take off the activity from the very low levels that we had normally achieved at year-end, when the activity shutdown for the year-end.</p><p><strong>David Raso</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p><p>That's helpful. Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. We'll now take our next question from JP Morgan from the line of Ann Duignan. And your line is now open.</p><p><strong>Ann Duignan</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p><p>Yes, good morning everybody.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Hi Ann.</p><p><strong>Ann Duignan</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p><p>I'm just going to continue on David's question and ask you if sales don't materialize in the ag sector in Q2, is it your intent to cut production in the back half of the year and end up with lower inventories or are you going to just sit on higher levels of inventory through the course of the whole year and hope that the margins comes back next year?</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>Ann, this is Max speaking. I'll take this question. So for Q2, we expect to be down in production -- slightly down year-over-year, low mid single-digit and so we expect to step rebalancing that inventory early on in the year and not wait until the last quarter.</p><p><strong>Ann Duignan</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p><p>Okay, I appreciate that. And then on construction equipment, can you comment a little bit more on the weakness in your compact equipment? Yes, I appreciate that might be leveraged to residential construction, but can you talk about maybe how much of that business goes to rental versus true sales, just a little bit more color, so we understand what exactly is happening in that business?</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>Yes, I would say besides the sluggish residential demand in North America, there is also an ag component. As you know, compact equipment goes into ag and livestock and Hay &amp; Forage is coming from two years of lows. So we don't see a lot of pickup in activity over there as well. And that's why we continue to look very conservatively at the inventory over there.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Yes. And some of it is a bit self-inflicted. So I think we can do better and we had a nice discussion with our teams. So I think you're going to see an increased performance going forward there.</p><p>By the way, I think, to be fair to the others, we should really limit it to like one to two question per analysts because we have a pretty full line and we only have 15 minutes left. I hope that's OK, Ann, right?</p><p><strong>Ann Duignan</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p><p>That's fine. No problem. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you very much. We'll now take our next question from Equita from the line of Martino De Ambroggi. And your line is now open.</p><p><strong>Martino De Ambroggi</strong> -- <em>Equita SIM -- Analyst</em></p><p>Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon everybody, two questions. The first is on pricing. I saw ag and CE still with a positive price effect in your EBIT bridge. Should we expect a similar trend going forward even if the visibility and the market environment is not particularly favorable? And still focusing on the pricing, what happened to the CV which was down after several quarters in a row with a positive mix and price effect?</p><p>And the second question is on the competitive scenario in the gas LNG engine in the truck business, because in your remarks, Max, you talked about new entries. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what's happening in the competitive environment for this potential mega trend and if this generated price pressure which could reduce the profitability of this segment. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Okay. Let me start and then Max chimes in. So on pricing for construction and ag, pricing is holding. We are also pricing for the tariffs and raw material headwinds that we're seeing and we see this holding throughout the year. On top of that, we do believe that we have pricing possibility also in construction equipment because as you know, the 80:20 methodology looks of course at different A&amp;D products and A&amp;D customers and that allows you to price for your B customers and for your B products. So you're going to see some positivity there despite all the uncertainty around. Max is going to talk about the commercial vehicle in a second.</p><p>Let me also comment on your second questions on LNG. I mean as we predicted, we had 70% share there. And the second competitor that has a solution had 30%. We have now balanced that out a little bit. We are 60% they got 40%, but it is with healthy margins and we also don't have to lower our prices. We looked a little bit at our MRA contracts and our buyback amounts and have adjusted those slightly, little bit more to reality and to become a little bit more customer-friendly. But it is a very, very successful and profitable segment for us which is growing high two digits and as you know, we have said by the end of the year, we think that LNG is going to compose 2.5% of the European heavy-duty truck market. And that number can go significantly higher in the quarters and years to come. Given that LNG is really the only short-term solution to reduce CO2 emissions, particulate matters and Nox.</p><p>And then, Max, do you want to say something on pricing for CV?</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>So as I said in my prepared remarks, the underlying pricing performance in CV is still positive, and is primarily light duty application performance. But in our WACC, we show a net pricing which is netting out the underlying pricing from the transaction FX and year-over-year hedge impacts on our currency hedging portfolio, which actually were higher than the price increase that we achieved in the quarter. That's why you see a negative number.</p><p><strong>Martino De Ambroggi</strong> -- <em>Equita SIM -- Analyst</em></p><p>So going forward should remain positive for the rest of the year?</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>Yes, the pricing function before ForEx is supposed to stay positive on CV as well.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>Martino De Ambroggi</strong> -- <em>Equita SIM -- Analyst</em></p><p>Okay, thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We now take our next question from Vertical Research from the line of Joe O'Dea. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.</p><p><strong>Joe O'Dea</strong> -- <em>Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst</em></p><p>Hi, good morning.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Hi Joe.</p><p><strong>Joe O'Dea</strong> -- <em>Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst</em></p><p>Could you talk to a little bit -- now that you're giving us a little bit more detail on the construction business, could you just talk about the revenue breakdown across compacts, general, road building and then mix opportunities there? I mean maybe if we're liking it to trucks and some of what you're doing on the light duty side and sort of driving out growth and margins up there, what are the opportunities that you have with construction and where you can put a different emphasis on different parts of that business?</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Yes, well, I don't know how much detail we really want to provide by product line now, but I think we basically have in our strategy a stronger focus on customer end segments, and trying to create a leadership in those sub-segments. And that strategy proves to be fairly successful. And on the back of that, obviously we're improving profitability.</p><p>And then if we switch to the commercial vehicle side, obviously we are one of the leaders in light commercial vehicles, and with the New Daily launch right now with the new platform, we're extremely excited about that and we see a lot of positive market reaction in perception in that. So we think that we can grow sales there throughout the year.</p><p>And then when it comes to the heavy, apart from our leadership in LNG, which is going to drive sales and replace diesel units, we are also launching a complete new 2019 heavy duty platform, which is also going to help the profitability on the diesel side and will then concurrently drive diesel and LNG sales.</p><p>Do you want to add something to that, Max? Okay. Thanks, Joe.</p><p><strong>Joe O'Dea</strong> -- <em>Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst</em></p><p>That's my question. Thanks a lot.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Bank of America from the line of Ross Gilardi. Please go ahead.</p><p><strong>Ross Gilardi</strong> -- <em>BofA Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p><p>Yes. Morning, good afternoon. Thanks everybody.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Hey, Ross.</p><p><strong>Ross Gilardi</strong> -- <em>BofA Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p><p>Hi. Hubertus, I was just wondering, I mean, given everything you're seeing on new equipment demands and in agriculture for row crop, I mean, just given the near term headwinds, what's your best explanation for how the used market is staying so well balanced (inaudible) and our pricing is holding up so well. I mean is it inevitable that that market is going to build some slack over the rest of the year. And can you -- do you think the industry and -- more importantly CNH can sustain that without having to cut production on new more aggressively.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Max, do you want to say something to that, kick it off and then I chime in?</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>So I mean when we transition from Tier 4A to Tier 4B, the productivity enhancements were not decided. So I would say the recent model year used equipment is pretty well performing. And hence in a period where net farm income is not on the upswing but farmers still need to replace dated equipment, they probably look first into what is available on the recent model year used and that is mainly the reason why pricing is holding up so well over there. But obviously when that recent mode year use is depleted, there is only one place, which is the new equipment and that's why, as well the demand of new equipment, although not growing is holding up. Well, let's remind all of us that we are still (inaudible) below the 20 year average in terms of units for (inaudible) power tractors and combines in North America.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Yeah. And that's the replacement demand that Max is talking about. And then, I mean just to be clear, I mean what the US administration is doing right now with the tariff discussion is really, really not helping the US farmers and. Again, if we can't find a trade solution with China and Europe soon, it will have a very negative effect to US farmers and also to equipment. However, we do believe that in this case then, we're going to see a lot of support given and support is already given as you know for soybeans, for example. However, the support that the farmers receive right now from the administration is kept -- its kept at pretty low values like $150,000 for soybeans for example. We do believe that that those caps have to be lifted up significantly. And as a matter of fact, we will be -- I mean we'll be in Washington tomorrow and we're going to talk exactly about that because we do believe that to help US farmers, the US administration has to basically lift up those caps to more reasonable levels because right now, the large-scale farms, which are very important in the row crop sector for our Case customers, they are limited to $150,000. So they are leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table, and that's not justifiable. So we do believe that in this uncertain environment, we're going to see also some measures to support those farmers if those trade discussions linger on.</p><p><strong>Ross Gilardi</strong> -- <em>BofA Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p><p>Okay. Got it. And then increase in R&amp;D spending for ag in the quarter (inaudible) you flagged that, how much of that is for the Stage V emissions versus precision farming and in any way to quantify that for the rest of the year would we expect that that margin headwinds to persist for the balance of 2019?</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Yeah. I mean, Ross, your question was really not very well -- acoustically we couldn't hear it. I think you are asking for the margin performance in ag. And we were referring to the Magnum tractors, which is actually entirely new cash crop platform that we are developing and that's the reason for the significantly higher R&amp;D spend in the first quarter. Needless to say we're launching this product this year and with the launch there, the R&amp;D headwind is going to abate a little bit.</p><p>So we kind of have a front-loaded R&amp;D budget there. So we think that margins are going to hold. And as you've seen on the gross margin side. We've improved that nicely by how many bps?</p><p><strong>Massimiliano Chiara</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer and Cheif Sustainability Officer</em></p><p>40 bps.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>40 bps, exactly and we think we've got more room for improvement there. So we're fairly positive on the margin side for ag, and again the drag on the EBIT margin was really with the front loaded R&amp;D for the significant investments that we do in precision agriculture on our new tractor platform, which actually is going to be a game changer in the cash crop sector for us.</p><p><strong>Ross Gilardi</strong> -- <em>BofA Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p><p>Okay, thanks a lot.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Thanks.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. And our final question comes from Melius from the line of Robert Wertheimer. And your line is open. Please go ahead.</p><p><strong>Robert Wertheimer</strong> -- <em>Melius -- Analyst</em></p><p>Thank you. And hello everybody.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>Hey. How is it going?</p><p><strong>Robert Wertheimer</strong> -- <em>Melius -- Analyst</em></p><p>Good, thanks. My question is really on LNG in the ramp. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on the current fueling infrastructure that your current sales base sort of uses and then how far the sales base can expand with current infrastructure. Does there need to be any step function change in order for the sales growth to continue?</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>No. Investments, investments happened as we speak, and this is not a showstopper for the rollout of LNG. As we've discussed numerous times, Germany is behind -- has been behind but we're going to have an infrastructure of 30 to 40 LNG stations by mid-to-end of this year. And this is sufficiently to run your large fleet. So what we're seeing right now is that talking about those large fleets, they never buy a couple of hundreds at the same time, they basically by a couple of handful pieces of equipment LNG to try it out. And once they basically work they then -- and they do work, of course, then they basically increase the quantity. So we are very, very firmly in that right now. All the large fleets are right now in test of LNG equipment. We do have the infrastructure available throughout Europe and also in Germany. That's the reason why we're very, very confident that these high two-digit if not three digit increases of LNG participation are going to continue well into the next years.</p><p><strong>Robert Wertheimer</strong> -- <em>Melius -- Analyst</em></p><p>And the current market is in fact freight hauling or is it more local trucks that you're selling to and I'll stop there?</p><p><strong>Hubertus M. Muhlhauser</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p>No it's long haul. LNG is long haul because it's really where you need the distance and where you need to wait. And as we have said, our record right now stands from one trip with one filling from London to Madrid, so 1,700 kilometers, so a bit more than 1,000 miles. So this is clearly a long haul application.</p><p>If you think about medium- and short-hauling, so the light commercial vehicles and the medium trucks, there you talk about CNG which is compressed natural gas. So the same engine, it's just a different tank system, which is significantly cheaper because CNG is just compressed whereas LNG is liquid and is frozen down to minus 170 degrees Celsius. I don't know what the Fahrenheit of that is. I should know that, but I'm thinking your team here.</p><p>And then the other one which we mentioned is and this is also for urban applications is (inaudible) methane, because CNG can be replaced by methane, bio-methane and this really comes from waste incineration, it comes from bio-gas. And if you basically put that bio-gas, so bio-methane into those CNG engines, then you're actually cleaning the environment, and this is the reason why we think politicians should be mindful of that, because this is significantly better than electrification because you're really cleaning the CO2 environment, and with the CO2 because you go down to minus 160 to minus 180 CO2 reduction, which is far better than any battery powered or fuel cell powered equipment can do. And that's something that people need to understand.</p><p>And as you know, being the leader on the on-highway side on that one, we are now pushing for that in the off-road side, so agricultural, it's a no-brainer, with all the bio gas that you have, and of course also for construction equipment, specifically in urban areas. It's actually very exciting. We are creating the market there, because we are kind of the only competitor in the off-highway side that has a competitive offering there. So good things to happen for us.</p><p><strong>Robert Wertheimer</strong> -- <em>Melius -- Analyst</em></p><p>Thanks, Hubertus.</p><p><strong>Hubertus M.
