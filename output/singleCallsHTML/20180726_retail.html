<p>Now I would like to introduce Stuart Tanz, the company's Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Good morning, everyone. Here with me today is Michael Haynes, our Chief Financial Officer and Rick Schoebel, our Chief Operating Officer. We are pleased to report that the company had another solid productive quarter. Building on our record leasing activity in the first quarter, during the second quarter, we continued to make the most of the strong demand for space across our portfolio. While in the first quarter our activity largely centered around releasing and renewing anchor spaces, our activity in the second quarter was predominantly focused on releasing a number of in-line spaces where we not only achieved strong rent growth through our releasing initiatives, but we also, importantly, continued to broaden our necessity-based tenancies.</p>
<p>With respect to acquisitions, we continue to take a cautious and patient approach. Accordingly, we've only acquired two shopping centers thus far in 2018, one of which we acquired in the first quarter and the other we acquired during the second quarter. Both are located in the Pacific Northwest, one specifically in the Seattle market and one in the Portland market, both markets being among the very best sought-after fastest growing markets in the country. Both acquisitions fit our portfolio perfectly. Both are stable, well-leased properties. In fact, both are currently a 100% leased. Both feature well-established supermarkets that are among the most highly productive stores in each operator's chain. Additionally, both properties offer opportunities for our team to enhance value going forward.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, we also acquired a freestanding prominent pad at one of our existing grocery-anchored shopping centers. The pad features Starbucks, along with Union Bank and several other spaces that we are already in the works to release. Beyond these acquisitions, we continue to keep a close eye on the market. While during the first half of 2018 there was considerable hesitation among buyers and sellers across our markets, we are now starting to see more favorable conditions again for attractive off-market acquisition opportunities. In fact, we are starting to look more closely at several interesting opportunities. However, we continue to take a cautious approach with our outlook and guidance and continue to assume that we will remain on the sidelines for the time being.</p>
<p>Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Haines to take you through our financial results for the second quarter. Mike?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Haines</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Stuart. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company had $72.3 million in total revenues and $23.8 million in operating income. GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2018 was $7.3 million, equating to $0.06 per diluted share. In terms of funds from operations, in the second quarter of 2018, FFO totaled $33.4 million, equating to $0.27 per diluted share.</p>
<p>Affecting FFO in the second quarter was the delayed timing of new tenants' rent commencements, driven in large part by the ongoing slow permitting process, particularly as it relates to our properties in the Pacific Northwest where it's taking six to eight months in some cases to get new lease permits pulled, as the local municipalities continue to be inundated with applications.</p>
<p>With respect to profit level non-operating income, on a same-center comparative basis, which includes all of the shopping centers that we have owned since April 2017, encompassing over 90% of our total portfolio of GLA today, cash NOI increased by 2.8% for the second quarter of 2018, as compared to the second quarter of last year.</p>
<p>In terms of our guidance for the full year, we remain on track, both in terms of FFO and same-center NOI, to achieve our previously stated range. Where in the range we'll end up is difficult to say at this point, but the biggest driver is when new leases commence paying rent. As Rich will discuss in a minute, we currently have about $7 million in annual rent relating to new leases signed, but rent hasn't commenced yet as we await the completion of the permitting process. If a good portion of that $7 million were to commence in Q3, then we could end up more toward the higher end of our range for the full year. However, if the bulk of it does not commence until the fourth quarter, then we could be more toward the lower end.</p>
<p>Turning to the company's balance sheet, at June 30, the company had a total market cap of approximately $3.9 billion, with about $1.5 billion of debt outstanding, equating to a debt-to-total market cap ratio of 39%. With respect to the $1.5 billion of debt, the vast majority of that was unsecured. In fact, only $96 million was mortgage debt at June 30. Accordingly, 94% of our portfolio today is unencumbered, which will increase further as we will be retiring a $9 million mortgage that matures at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>In looking out further, in terms of our overall debt maturities, we're continuing to maintain a stable well-laddered schedule. Beyond the one small mortgage maturing at the end of the third quarter, we have virtually no fixed rate debt maturing for the next four years and beyond that, our maturity schedule is balanced with only about 16% to 18% of our fixed rate debt maturing each year from 2023 through 2027. In terms of our floating rate debt, our exposure is limited today to our credit line, which had a balance of $192 million at June 30, equating to only 12.5% of our total debt outstanding.</p>
<p>Our credit line maturity currently extends out for another three years from now, with the ability to extend it an additional year to 2022, to be coterminous with our term loan. With respect to equity, as we have indicated previously, our goal is to issue between $25 million and $50 million of equity during 2018, with the proceeds going toward paying down debt. To-date, thus far, we have issued roughly $2.6 million of equity through our ATM program.</p>
<p>Now I'll turn the call over to Rich Schoebel, our COO to discuss property operations. Rich?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Mike. As both Stuart and Mike highlighted, our portfolio continues to perform very well. Our key operating metrics, occupancy, same-center NOI, and same-space rents, all continue to be strong. In fact, dating back to 2012, when we commenced reporting operating metrics, with a portfolio of 34 shopping centers at that time. In the six years since, during which time we have grown our portfolio substantially, nearly threefold, we have achieved same-center NOI and same-space rent growth each and every quarter; 26 consecutive quarters and counting.</p>
<p>To take you through our specific results for the second quarter, starting with occupancy, we continue to maintain our portfolio lease rate above 97%, ending the second quarter at a very strong 97.5% leased, including having a record 41 shopping centers that are 100% leased. Breaking the 97.5% lease rate down between anchor and non-anchor space, at June 30, our anchor space was a full 100% leased and our shop-space stood at 94.5% leased. During the second quarter we executed 42 new leases, all of them being non-anchor space totaling 99,000 square feet, achieving a 20.4% increase in same-space cash rents on average. And as Stuart alluded to, demand for in-line space continues to be driven more and more by service-oriented retailers, as well as organic health-oriented restaurants.</p>
<p>And just to give a sense of the demand, in our Seattle market, we're seeing something that we have never seen before in our 20-plus years of operating in the Pacific Northwest. Potential new tenants are coming to us and submitting unsolicited standing offers to lease space at our properties that are currently 100% leased and don't have any space rolling for a long while; over year plus in some cases. Needless to say, this works to our advantage and enhances our ability to negotiate new leases, as well as our ability to proactively replace underperforming tenant base.</p>
<p>Turning to renewals, just like we experienced during the first quarter, tenants continue to come to us early to renew their leases. During the second quarter, we executed 55 renewals totaling 167,000 square feet, and just as with our new leasing activity, the bulk of our renewals centered around in-line shop spaces. Overall, we achieved a solid 7.6% increase in renewal of cash-based rent on average, which includes one anchor renewal, where a longtime tenant simply exercised the renewal option that had a predetermined contractual renewal rent that was only a nominal increase and is well below the current market.</p>
<p>In terms of the economic spread between build and lease space, at the start of the second quarter, the spread was about 3%, representing approximately $6.8 million in additional annual rent on a cash basis. During the second quarter, tenants representing about $1.7 million of that incremental $6.8 million started paying rent, of which $290,000 of the $1.7 million was received in the second quarter. Taking the remaining $5.1 million, together with our leasing activity during the second quarter, as of June 30, the spread was 3%, representing approximately $7.1 million, the bulk of which we expect will come online as we move through the second half of 2018.</p>
<p>Finally, looking ahead, based on the ongoing demand for space, together with our portfolio of strong location attributes and necessity-focused tenant roster, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong portfolio results.</p>
<p>Now, I'll turn the call back over to Stuart.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Rich. In addition to proactively managing our portfolio and tenancies, as we have always done, and has always been the foundation of our success, during this past quarter, we've begun to explore densification opportunities across our portfolio. The long-term goal being threefold; to capitalize on our strong, highly sought-after infill locations, to enhance the long-term competitive position of our shopping centers, and to drive the underlying intrinsic value of our portfolio.</p>
<p>A growing number of the various municipalities that we interact with regularly, through operating our portfolio, are being increasingly proactive with us in exploring the feasibility of adding multi-family to a number of our properties to address the growing demand for quality-housing at prime locations, such as ours. With that as a backdrop, we are in the process of carefully examining each of our properties in a specific community profile and needs in which they are situated to determine the properties and the communities that are best suited for adding a multi-family component and what the resulting potential financial impact could be.</p>
<p>Thus far, our preliminary analysis has identified 20 of our properties where the demand, the ease of execution, and the economics, all look favorable. In fact, by our estimation, it could possibly increase the intrinsic value by as much as $400 million potentially, just on these 20 properties alone. Going forward, we will begin to carefully examine how to best go about potentially realizing this value as well as exploring other mixed-use densification opportunities across our portfolio.</p>
<p>Now, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator?</p>
<div class="interad"></div><h2>Questions and Answers:</h2>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Donnelly</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good morning, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Donnelly</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Stuart. Maybe just jumping in on the diversification point that you had just made, just I want to clarify, concerning those 20 properties and the $400 million, is that $400 million of investment opportunity or you are saying that's value that can be created over and above whatever the base of investment is?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>It's the value over and above.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Donnelly</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>And I guess, how significant of an investment would that be?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, we're in the early stages of exploring a lot of the analysis that have been done, and then how fast we pursue it. Our strategy could be very well different for each opportunity depending on the specifics. The process and the plan will take a bit of time, Jeff. So I would rather wait and provide some more details as we move into the next quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Donnelly</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>That's OK. And on the capital front, I think it was back at ICSC you were expressing maybe some interest or saying maybe there was some interest in issuing equity maybe to explore acquisitions at some point. Your share price is higher since that time period. I wasn't sure if your interest in issuing has intensified and I guess is it fair to say that if you did, the use of proceeds would be acquisitions?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>I think you would -- I mean the answer is, yes, we are monitoring the market and we certainly are looking to, over time, put some equity into the balance sheet, but that will also be -- we are also going to probably sell some assets as we go forward. So it's really a combination of doing both and as we move forward, depending on the velocity on both sides of that equation, then we'll look at the opportunity to keep growing the company as well as looking at market conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Donnelly</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>And just maybe one last one, maybe for Rich is, just looking at the shop space deals like the non-anchor deals that you guys have signed year-to-date, I think it's about $28 a square foot and change, which is pretty much in line with the expirations that are coming up in the rest of '18 and then into '19. I guess, one, I'm just wondering if you think that the deals that you signed are representative of market for where the expirations are that's coming up. I know there's a little bit of a mix issue there. Just curious, especially since the non-anchor rents you signed this year are a little lower than what was signed the same time last year. Again, I know it's apples and oranges, but it was sort of point to maybe a deceleration in shop brands or I was just curious if am I reading that right.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>No, we don't think so. I think that the leases that are -- we see coming up over the next 12, 18, 24 months are all still on average below market and we still expect to have good same-center rent growth in terms of that.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Donnelly</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Great, guys. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy from Citi. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Christine.</p>
<p><strong>Christine McElroy</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good morning, all. Just wanted to follow-up on Jeff's question on the densification analysis. You mentioned next quarter maybe providing a little bit more detail, I'm just trying to get a sense for how much additional detail would you expect to provide to us, to the investment community, you threw out the $400 million number, wondering how long we should wait to get more details on that to be able to do our own analysis and are you still thinking about this as sort of land contribution or outright sales to JV partners with little incremental capital invested on your part?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>We're exploring all of those in the coming quarter. We're very excited in terms of what we see. There are opportunities to certainly begin entitlements on a number of some vacant land as well as some assets that we have in terms of the process. It's a bit difficult at this point to tell you when we're going to provide all of this color, but we certainly will have more to talk about as we move through the next quarter and more importantly, we feel that the amount of detail that's gone into this analysis, it's pretty -- makes us pretty comfortable in terms of what we can achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Christine McElroy</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And then just with regard to same-store NOI guidance, thanks for the color on sort of the commencement timing in the second half, but how should we be thinking about any other kind of major drivers as we think about same-store NOI growth? And based on where you are today and where we are in the quarter, I think you mentioned that if the leases were to commence this quarter that you'd be toward the high end, but I would think that you'd have a little bit more visibility on that at this point. So should we expect -- are you kind of saying like you're guiding more toward the midpoint at this point with the chance toward the lower end based on where we are in the quarter?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, we can start with the quarter. So -- and really the anchors that we took offline late last year, we have made good progress in terms of construction. So right now it does look like those anchors will open during the quarter and start paying rent. I don't know if you want to add anything to that in terms of our same-store NOI guidance?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Haines</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, I was going to just add that our Q1 and Q2 same-store actually came in stronger than we had actually predicted in our own internal modeling and our modeling actually showed just that second half of the year being stronger than the first half of the year. So we are still expecting to ramp up in the Q3 and Q4 to bring that up into that -- well into that range.</p>
<p><strong>Christine McElroy</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. So even if these leases come online sort of in August, September, you're still looking at the potential for the upper end?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Haines</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Christine McElroy</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you, Christine.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Todd.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, good morning. Just following up there on the same-store NOI growth and your comments, Mike, so the guidance was 2.5 to 3.5 for the year. You're saying that you did a little bit better so far in the first half relative to your expectations. But there were delays in permitting and commencements, I guess, that you talked about. So are you saying that you're seeing a larger acceleration than you previously expected now as a result, as you think about the full year or are you tracking sort of in line with expectations?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Haines</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>I would say we're tracking more in line. You have to remember, in our case, because we're -- we've been really acquisitive over the last few years, our year-over-year pool is slightly smaller pool than the quarter-over-quarter-pool. So I'm thinking of one of the centers that we have that -- where we got the anchor repositioning, I'm not sure that that was in the year-over-year pool. So I think we still feel pretty comfortable with the range we have set out.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And then I guess thinking about 2018 in general, right, growth has slowed somewhat just particularly I guess relative to the company's growth over the last six or seven years or so during the cycle here. Do you expect that to sort of reaccelerate on a full year basis going forward into 2019 when you look at the commencements and the signed but not yet occupied space and all of that reanchoring and so forth? Is that sort of what the model is showing here?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>It's hard to predict because you're talking about the acquisition market. It's -- certainly also we're very cognizant of the balance sheet and delevering of that balance sheet is important to us both in terms of issuing a bit of equity and selling some assets and paying debt down on our balance sheet. So really it's a situation where we're going to continue to monitor the markets, monitor our balance sheet and if the right opportunity comes along, we could be inquisitive in terms of the second half.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And, Stuart, along those lines actually, so you mentioned that you are seeing some interesting acquisition opportunities starting to surface. Can you just elaborate on that comment and describe what you are seeing out there?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>We're seeing -- we continue to work on potentially some more OP transactions. Those seem to be moving now at an accelerated pace along with some interesting off-market opportunities in primarily both North and Southern California. These are things that we, as you know, take a lot of time and it's obviously -- a lot of this is through relationships. So it looks like the second half could have a couple of exciting sort of situations out there that hopefully will come to fruition, but nothing I can articulate in detail at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>But so -- but from a product standpoint, nothing outside of what you've historically looked to invest in, right? So grocery-anchored, necessity-based, this isn't something when you say interesting that's more high yielding or big box or anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>No, this is dominant grocery-anchored properties in affluent dense markets, in the primary markets on the West Coast.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Haines</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Todd.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Todd.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund from Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>George Hoglund</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, good morning, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Hey, George, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>George Hoglund</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good. Just two questions from me. One, just what's your updated view of the drugstore sector and your exposure there? And then two, were there any notable changes to the tenant watchlist?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure, this is Rich. I think you're probably focused primarily on the Albertsons and Rite Aid transaction and as we've previously discussed, we think that that merger is going to be a positive as the combined company's credit is going to be -- profile is going to be much stronger. We currently have 20 shopping centers that either have an Albertsons, Safeway or Vons in them and those only account for approximately 5.7% of our base rent. And we have 14 shopping centers with Rite Aid in them and that accounts for 1.6% of our base rent.</p>
<p>Of the 20 shopping centers that have the Albertsons or Vons in them, only five of those currently have drug stores in them. So we see this as an opportunity where potentially Albertsons could bring Rite Aid to the shopping center either within the existing footprint or as an additional space in the center. Our other drug stores continue to perform very well, and in terms of a watchlist, they are the names that you see out there, but primarily we don't have a lot of exposure to any one that is in those categories.</p>
<p><strong>George Hoglund</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks for the color.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>Wes Golladay</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey, good morning, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Wes.</p>
<p><strong>Wes Golladay</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey, Stuart. I just want to go back to that densification, at $400 million, it's a very large number. So how do you balance the Street having a full understanding and appreciation of that opportunity versus maybe doing some OP unit deals or equity later on?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, they are two totally separate things, right. I mean, obviously OPs is -- issuing OPs is more in line with our traditional business of acquiring assets. The densification that we spent a lot of time on has several interesting elements. I mean, one of them is, we do have some vacant land. Vacant land gives us the ability to move through the entitlements and start building quite quickly. And that's probably a third of the valuation, or about 25% of the valuation, so that would come very quickly. But more importantly, it's tough to really give much color yet on the -- on each individual properties.</p>
<p>So -- but the densification is totally stuck from our ongoing business and more importantly, we will be looking at various structures that relates to that densification because at the end of the day it isn't our business and the risk profile does change if we decide to go, obviously build the multi-family out, which is not our expertise. So there's great -- there are some great opportunities here for the company in terms of realizing value, and we'll see how things progress. We're working very diligently on this right now. And again, we'll have [ph] more to talk about next quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Wes Golladay</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Yeah, maybe I can clarify the question a little for you. Just saying like, if you were to do an OP deal with someone you want to buy an asset from, and you have this embedded value that might not be reflected in your stock today that may get realized maybe over the next few quarters as you lay out your densification plans, so maybe you get some appreciation in your stock, if you were to do an OP deal today, do you think that buyers would have an appreciation for that densification opportunity that the Wall Street might not appreciate at the moment, and would you still look to do an above-market OP deal?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes. The answer is, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Wes Golladay</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And then maybe going down to the, I guess, maybe some bigger moving parts for guidance, maybe not so much for this year, but looking out to next year for that. Given that $7 million of income to roll through the NOI growth plan, is there any major recaptures that you see coming up that would (Multiple Speakers) capital?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Not so much recaptures, but we do have a couple of anchor renewals coming up that have very large mark-to-market that are yet to finish, but should get finished shortly. So that will continue to drive our cash spreads, either at the levels they're at or actually move a bit higher. I don't know, if you want to add to that?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, I mean, there are other recapture opportunities that we are working on. They are hard to predict in terms of timing because we typically like to have our replacements lined up before we are taking back the space. So there are things we're working on that have some really nice lists, but nothing that we see happening imminently, but there definitely are some opportunities out there.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, and we have identified another, I think it's 11 pads to build in our shopping centers and we're on our way on a number of those right now. So, that's some incremental NOI that will be coming that we haven't accounted for yet.</p>
<p><strong>Wes Golladay</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And then looking at that $4 million pad acquisition this quarter, did that do anything like activate anything else at their property or is it just more of an opportunistic play?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>That was an -- really the --</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Yeah, we are reassembling the property. If some prior owner had sold-off a key pad in the shopping center, we like to control the windows to our shopping center. We don't like to be competing against some other owner within our shopping center for shop rents. This space has a very prominent location and some space that were really being underutilized, we are currently cleaning the space up and have a lot of interest in it and getting substantially more rent than they were prior.</p>
<p><strong>Wes Golladay</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks for answering all the questions.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone from Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Vince or good early morning.</p>
<p><strong>Vince Tibone</strong> -- <em>Green Street Advisors -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Can you provide a little bit more color on deleveraging plans. Is there a leverage level that you're targeting, and can you discuss any -- provide more detail on any plan to sell assets this year?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Haines</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Hey, Vince, this is Mike. So, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, our plan is to do $45 million to $50 million of equity down year end and use those proceeds on that. Hopefully, we expect to generate $10 million to $15 million of free cash flow during the second half of the year, which will also be used to reduce debt. Importantly, our balance sheet is pretty solid. Those proceeds obviously will help move our net debt-to-EBITDA or leverage level down. As far as assets sales, I don't know if you want to comment on that at all?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. I mean we are progressing on asset sales. So I think as we move into the balance of the year, I think we'll have some nice things to talk about there and I think that will help along with what Mike is articulating, delever the balance sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Vince Tibone</strong> -- <em>Green Street Advisors -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. There's no kind of debt-to-EBITDA level you're targeting or trying to reach by year end, it seems like it's a more fluid-on approach then?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Haines</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>I wouldn't say there is a specific target number, I would like (inaudible) share and we will work toward that.</p>
<p><strong>Vince Tibone</strong> -- <em>Green Street Advisors -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks. And then one more for me on kind of the acquisition side. Is the current patience you're showing on acquisitions more driven by your current public cost of capital or just cap rates being very aggressive in your markets?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>It's a combination of product. There is some product on the market, but it's really some of the product we've seen over the last couple of years that's been sort of recycled back into the market. Nothing too exciting as I would tell you in the first half, but we're starting to see some interesting off-market acquisitions come our way very recently, along with our cost of capital. It's really both.</p>
<p><strong>Vince Tibone</strong> -- <em>Green Street Advisors -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, makes sense. Thank you. That's all I have.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Mueller</strong> -- <em>JPMorgan -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey. The question is on the OP units. I think you've largely touched on that. I guess, Mike, was there anything abnormal in the quarter in terms of the FFO run rate maybe something that was one-time in nature?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Haines</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p>
<p>Not in this quarter, and looking back at Q1, we had a large termination fee from our properties. And in addition to that, we had a couple of non-recurring FAS 141 additive adjustments that were in Q1 that didn't repeat obviously in Q2. That's the big driver of it perhaps [ph].</p>
<p><strong>Michael Mueller</strong> -- <em>JPMorgan -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, but nothing really in Q2. Okay. That was it. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas from Capital One. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Hey, Chris, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Lucas</strong> -- <em>Capital One -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick questions. I guess, Stuart, just on the asset sales that you described, are you -- would you be looking at anything that is to sell in any of your core markets? You've had conversations about selling stuff in Sacramento for a couple of years now, as well as, I think Tahoe. I'm just curious as to if there is anything in the core markets that you'd be looking to potentially sell.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, it's a combination of -- right now we are moving forward both in Sacramento and Tahoe as well as in some of our core markets as well.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Lucas</strong> -- <em>Capital One -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And then I guess -- I'm curious about the permitting comment that was made. I guess I'm just trying to understand, is that -- is the permitting getting worse, so it's always been tough? So I guess I'm just curious as to, is this more of a recent phenomenon or just the consistency that's been in place for the last several years?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>This is Rich. I think it's actually gotten a touch worse. The municipalities are just inundated with permit request. The city of Seattle, you can't even bring in permit. You have to request an appointment six to eight months out. So we've been very proactive by requesting those appointments ahead of time, even when we don't necessarily have a project in hand because we know we're going to have a project. So it's about being very proactive. We employ expediters when that would help the process. The cities are just short staffed in terms of moving these things through the process.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Lucas</strong> -- <em>Capital One -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>And is the expediters helping anymore? Is that process sort of also sort of been exploited as fully as it possibly can?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>They're very effective in certain municipalities and not so effective in others and that's why we employ them selectively where they can add value.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Lucas</strong> -- <em>Capital One -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And then, Rich, while I have you, I guess, just as it relates to the mix of the lease to commence spread in terms of the revenue, is there -- is it -- is the mix mostly in the shop space arena, or is there any large sort of anchor revenue that could be -- could swing sort of the -- be more important in terms of the timing than the rest of the bucket?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Yeah, there the majority of it's going to be shop that -- lot of what our leasing is recently, but there are a couple of anchor deals within there that had some pretty big rent attached to it.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Lucas</strong> -- <em>Capital One -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And I guess just on that spread, I mean, you've guys have been sort of running at this rate for a little while. Is it possible to bring that down or is it just sort of, again all these factors that come into play that sort of create this consistent sort of $7 million lease to commence the rent spread?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it's down to touch going into 2018 here. We are always going to be adding to the bucket, but we do see that it will come down, although I don't know if the [ph] level would be zero.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>I mean, look, we're continuing to play offence, Chris, and as you probably know when you've got such a highly occupied portfolio, you can aggressively stay ahead of those renewals. So, that's the advantage of having an operating platform that again is playing offense or still playing offense. That's what will continue to just drive our cash spreads probably higher as we move through the year, the fact that we stay so far ahead of our tenant base.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Lucas</strong> -- <em>Capital One -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. And then my last question just, Stuart, just on the 11 pad sites. I guess, I'm just curious as to what the total rent opportunity is there and how much of that is already signed up pad? Where are you in terms of the process for whether it's the permitting, the construction, the delivery, commencement on those 11?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>We're making good progress on a number of them, un-levered yield between 11% and 12%, $21 million spent in capital, in terms of the numbers. So -- but those pads do take time. As Rich said, you've still got to get them entitled, but I would tell you --</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>About half of them are entitled and ready, basically about to putting shovels in the ground, some are under construction, some are a touch further out, but this is real and there is leases on the ones that are ready to go. And so, no, we feel very good about it.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Lucas</strong> -- <em>Capital One -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions this morning.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Good morning, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong> -- <em>Bank of America -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good morning. On your densification review, you mentioned ease of execution. I'm just wondering if this would include a community that had strong nimby perspective or maybe a slow moving municipality that might be giving a low priority making that execution a little different, or is it just physical that you're talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, there's a huge housing shortage in our markets. That I think is helping this process in a big way. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've actually had the -- some of the municipalities we operate in, reach out to us.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think to your question about the adjacent property owners having some pushback about this, I mean, I think we're already talking about commercial properties, so there, at some level, this is considered to be an upgrade from having a shopping center with deliveries at three in the morning, having residential going next to them, is actually considered better. So are you always going to have (inaudible) out there who is going to show up at every city council meeting? Probably. But that's part of the process we are working through to get those entitlements.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong> -- <em>Bank of America -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. So, it really isn't a factor then. I mean, I guess what you meant more by ease of execution is like vacant land where you could move more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong> -- <em>Bank of America -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong> -- <em>Bank of America -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy from Citi. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Hi, Christine.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bilerman</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey, it's actually Michael Bilerman.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Hey, Mike. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bilerman</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Fantastic. So I just want to come back on the $400 million. So it sounds like you said 25% or $100 million is pure land sales, where ROIC would get the immediate $100 million of proceeds. So what does the $300 million remaining sort of represent and I assume all of this is on the un-discounted basis in terms of timing? But just can you give a little bit more color surrounding the $400 million? I mean, your entire portfolio is only worth $3.75 billion. So it's not an inconsequential number and so can you give a little bit more color around that?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>You know what, Mike, I would love to give you a ton of more detail, but the best thing for me to do is to probably get a bit more -- articulate this a bit more and give the detail a bit more as we move through sort of some of this process. Some of the entitlement process has already started. And in fact, in one of the -- one of the properties is senior housing in that we've listed among the 20. That project is actually under construction and will be done and opened and in our numbers at the beginning of 2019. So, I mean, the good news is that some of these properties are actually in process right now as we're sitting here. Others are going to require a lot more work. I'd love to break down this detail for you, but what I would prefer to do is give you a lot more color on this as we move through the next several quarters and at that point, I'll have some real things to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bilerman</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>And I guess, I'm not looking exactly for the details on 20 different projects. What I'm looking for is, you've thrown out a $400 million number, which is not a small number, right, a few dollars a share. How is the value creation on projects? Is that pure land sales? How does -- thinking of that $400 million, is that all ROIC share, is it the total value created, some of which obviously has to go to a partner? There's a lot of different variables. I think, if you're going to throw out a number like that, you got to be able to at least put some guardrails in terms of what it is, right. So, out of the $400 million, $100 million represents land on these projects, another $100 million represents potential residential projects that could be started in three years, and we're valuing, contributing our basis that we've put in at this and the other developer has got to be -- is going to spend $200 million based on that, we think the value creation is $50 million and that's that piece. So just trying to give us the different components of the $400, so that the Street can think about how to value that or how to treat that, I think is thoughtful [ph] if you're going to throw something else that large.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. Well, let me try to get very generic here and then I think this is basically -- I think at this time all we'd like to say. I mean, in doing the analysis obviously we looked at what we're removing, in the centers that we are removing some in-line space, we took that NOI offline and the value associated with it. Then we looked at what we're building in terms of the component of multi-family. And we looked at -- we did very detailed performance in terms of building that multi-family. And in doing so, we looked at the NOI associated with that. We took affordable housing into consideration in terms of the performance and other things. And then applied a value to what that would be worth once it was done. We then came up with a value after we stripped out the value that we're taking out and the value that we're creating. And that's how we get to what we are -- what the -- the net value creation. Hopefully, this is helping you.</p>
<p>In terms of costs and other things, the one thing that I don't want to -- the reason why I don't want to get into so much detail, because over the next several months, we'll be visiting structure on a number of these opportunities and structure can be many different things, as you know. And so that's why I would prefer to wait to give you some very concise details because I think over the next several quarters, whether we create a joint venture and bring in a developer to do this with us, whether we move forward and sell the entitlements and end up doing nothing, I mean, there's all kinds of opportunities here in terms of finding and hopefully getting to that value. But I would prefer to give you these details as we move through the process because over the next couple of quarters, we will be hopefully sort of bringing a lot of this sort of forward in terms of structure and then I can sort of give you those details with a lot more clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bilerman</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Right. But arguably value creation is all about risk and return depending on where you are, right, if you're doing something on yourself and you are going to be able to build it to a better yield and get that value creation. If you are selling that to a third party, that third-party who is taking on the risk of development is going to want a higher return, ergo you've reduced your risk because you're selling off the entitlements, you are selling off the project, your value creation to ROIC is less. So that's the scope of this $400 million, is in fact it's the way you described it is the potential full value, assuming all of your risk profile taking on all the development, the end result may be something very different if you end up contributing effectively the land to a third party. And so that's where I was trying to get at in terms of really trying to grasp what this $400 million represented.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yeah. No, you're right in terms of how you're describing that, but again I will prefer to give you more of those details as we move forward, because again as we move through and discuss structure with the operators and move the entitlement process forward on a number of these locations that will give us the flexibility and give us the ability to really fine-tune what that end value creation is going to end up looking like.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>(inaudible) I will just add to that. I think what Stuart is articulating is we're in the early stages of this process. We've taken a very high level look at the entire portfolio, identifying the properties that have the attributes that would allow for densification. We see -- in some place, it's going to be direct land sale, because it's raw land. That's very straightforward. In other cases, it's going to be selling the air rights, similar to what we're working on in Phase II up at the Crossroads. And in other cases, we may be taking some retail offline. And so I think it's just premature for us to get into those specifics. We're highlighting the broad opportunity and more specifics to come.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bilerman</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>How do you think Costa-Hawkins in California could play into some of the value that you'd want to create, given the large majority, I assume, of these projects are in California?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>There is -- some of them are in Seattle, some are in Portland and, yes, they are both in Northern and Southern California. We're watching obviously that very closely, Mike. And because this is brand new product, I don't know whether that impact will be that dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bilerman</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, typically rent control if enacted typically stymies new development because you can't push through rent increases going forward, but there could be -- obviously that could impact some of the value and the timing of achieving some of this. Last question just in terms of, you made a comment in your opening remarks, something you haven't seen in your history on the West Coast was retailers coming to your sites and coming to you to lease space. Maybe give a little bit more color around that. Is that anchor, is it in-line, is it national or regional or local, are they coming to you with lease terms, what are the rents that they're suggesting relative to in-place? Just a little bit more meat behind the bones on that.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Schoebel</strong> -- <em>Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. This is Rich again. I think it's primarily our regional and national tenants. I think the -- obviously, we've always been very proactive in keeping in front of the tenant base about pending opportunities and the rest. I think the difference here and the nuance here is where people are coming to us and telling us the center that they want to be in and what they're willing to pay and being much -- the tenants being much more proactive in terms of trying to secure the locations in the spots they want to be. While we've always had the proactive conversations with these tenants, this is unsolicited people coming to us, making offers where we don't even necessarily see an opportunity yet, but it gives us that ability then to engage with our tenant base to see where we can fit these people in.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bilerman</strong> -- <em>Citi -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Great, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Tanz</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
