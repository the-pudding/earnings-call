<p>Now, I'll turn the call over to Jason.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you, Thurman. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to make a few comments. For a detailed account of our financial results, please read the Shareholder Letter posted on our Investor Relations website.</p>
<p>Cirrus Logic reported revenue of 366.3 million in Q2 of FY '19, revenue exceeded the high end of guidance as orders for certain portable products moved into late Q2 from early Q3. Predicting revenue for these quarters can be particularly challenging, as we are typically ramping heavily at the quarter boundary and our customers can and frequently do change individual orders on short notice.</p>
<p>While our guidance for the December quarter reflects the shift in orders, we note the Company's expectations for this six month period remained relatively unchanged. With respect to the Company's overall expectations for the remainder of FY '19, the primary drivers of variability include end customer demand for handsets that utilize our products and timing of new smartphone launches expected late in the fiscal year. We are pleased with our progress in Q2 as design momentum across our portfolio was strong and numerous new devices were announced that use our components. In the smartphone market, we expanded our share with existing customers and began shipping two audio amplifiers and a haptic driver in a new North American flagship Android handset customer.</p>
<p>During the quarter, Company increased penetration of boosted amplifiers in flagship and mid-tier smartphones and ramped a new 55-nanometer amplifier with a leading customer. Further after our initial win in a single smartphone model last quarter, we expanded our footprint with one of the largest Android OEMs and are now shipping boosted amplifiers and multiple models. We expect additional flagship devices utilizing our technology to launch over the next six months. In haptics, we're delighted with our team's execution since Cirrus Logic began investing R&amp;D resources in this product line in calendar 2017.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, we are now shipping haptic driver in our first flagship Android smartphone. While design activity with our first generation haptic driver is robust and we expect new devices to come to market over the next 12 months using this component. We also plan on taping out our first product designed specifically for haptics in the spring of calendar '19. With an extensive portfolio of products and a compelling roadmap, we are encouraged as we continue to see increased demand for products that capitalize on our expertise in ultra-low power, low latency and, mixed-signal processing.</p>
<p>As we look to FY '20 with a solid pipeline of products and meaningful customer engagements, we remain confident in our ability to return to year-over-year revenue growth. Before we begin the Q&amp;A, I would also like to note that while we understand there is intense interest related to our largest customer in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about our business relationship.</p>
<p>Operator, we're now ready to take questions.</p>

</div><h2>Questions and Answers:</h2>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>(Operator Instructions)Your first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Tore Svanberg</strong> -- <em>Stifel -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yes. Thank you. First topic is haptics. So it sounds like, you're going to be offering haptics specific solution in the spring of '19. I was just hoping, Jason, you could elaborate a little bit on -- on what that means for you as a Company, especially when thinking about the integrated DSP and what that can offer customer for flexibility and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure, yeah. It's a great question. Yeah, I would say, it's kind of more -- the theme would be more or the same, it's kind of building on the success, we've had anytime you come out with a new device and you first engage our broad market, you learn about things where we could sweep in more-and-more of the system and just try to make it as a turnkey of a product as possible. And in particular, relative to the Android ecosystem, they really prefer to have self-contained devices that are not having us to do a lot of the development that cross multiple devices whenever possible. So it's really just kind of a little more purpose-built, little more integrated type of device.</p>
<p><strong>Tore Svanberg</strong> -- <em>Stifel -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Great, thanks. And my other question was on voice biometrics. You mentioned in the Shareholder Letter that everything is progressing there but could you update us on timing on when this could be more of a revenue driver for you? Is it going to be fiscal '21 or could it be earlier than that?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>I mean, we could see some contribution before that. But it's, that's probably a reasonable placeholder for when the potential is for to be meaningful, that is one of the further outfittings on our the layers to our growth strategy. I think obviously the short term is being driven significantly by progress in amplifiers and haptics in particular, broadening out our penetration into more-and-more of the Android ecosystem. Increasingly, we feel like haptics is a really good poster child for where we can take our audio technology and imply it to other areas that maybe aren't as audio and voice related.</p>
<p>But that mixed signal capability to embed high processing power in an integrated mixed signal device, maybe with higher voltage capabilities is a little bit unique and we're seeing a lot of pull-forward from the market. So we remain really excited about voice biometrics. But as you point out, it's further out in some of these other growth factors for us. Feedback from customers has been good. We've done a number of demos with various interesting customers for the technology and continue to look for ways to broaden out the appeal into other devices, obviously, we're targeting handsets first, but there's a lot of interest in it for other markets as well.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Ramsay</strong> -- <em>Cowen -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I guess, guys maybe you could talk a little bit about, you had given some commentary over the last couple of quarters about visibility to returning to growth in fiscal ' 20. Could you just expand on that a little bit, if that's definitely still the case, and kind of forward commentary would be helpful. There's just a lot of moving parts here from a macro perspective, which don't really affect the wireless market per se. But we just want to make sure we have things calibrated. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. Yeah, I mean. So just to be clear, we don't have any magic crystal ball as it relates to the macro situation and trade wars and all of that. So that the commentary about return to growth is definitely not reflective of us being overly rosy as it relates to what the general markets going to do, but it is reflective of content gains that we expect to see with customers we've already had. We do expect in the Q4 timeframe to get back to having a second customer that is north to 10%. So sorry for the challenge of raising -- have to pay attention to more than one customer of ours, but we're excited about that and that should drive a good result for us through the year.</p>
<p>So the return to growth is really based on things, where we know what we're shipping and we know the content we have in the content gains that are associated with that progress the team has made penetrating an increasing number of accounts in China, some of which are smaller. And we have to aggregate up a larger number of wins, but some of which are not so small, either in China or Korea, I'll just highlight the comment from the last Shareholder Letter where we are pretty excited to be now shipping to the top three handset manufacturers overall and we've been and as we kind of alluded to earlier, we've made some progress with some of the bigger guys in China. So that's what the guide, the outlook I guess I should say for FY '20 is based on is not any miraculous growth in the market are overly rosy outlook in that perspective, it is based on content gains and continued expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Ramsay</strong> -- <em>Cowen -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it, got it. That's helpful. And then I guess as a follow-up, completely unrelated. One of the-couple of trends, we've been following in smartphone space or I guess OEMs push to just have completely flat glass spaces with no real holes or buttons and additional wrinkle of potential folding phones and flexible phones and alike coming down the pike. Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the challenges around audio from microphone and speaker replacement et cetera for some of those type of designs. Is that an area of R&amp;D that might differentiate your products? If you see that as a driver or am I sort of going down around rapidly, I shouldn't be going down. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>No, I think that is already a driver of a lot of what we're doing, particularly as it relates to the boosted amplifiers and then also in a different way to some of the haptics stuff we're investing in. So the analogy I always use is probably, I remember back when they're in college and they had a chipset of stereo speakers, that were the size of a refrigerator but they sounded pretty good. It's easy to make things sound good when you got big speakers and a lot to air to move around.</p>
<p>But as things get really compressed, it seems like the acoustics folks are always left in line, when space in a handset or volume in a handset or microphone or speaker placement is decided, it's always the idea as it got to go first and get what they need, and so it becomes increasingly difficult to make these handsets and other products sound good as they get smaller and have less air to work with or less ideal placement of the transducers either on the input side or the output side.</p>
<p>So that's a lot of what we've done with the boosted amplifiers, for example, is just trying to make them sound -- continue to sound good and especially be louder in an environment where the speakers get smaller, and the air volume they have to work with get smaller. So as you spot on, that that's already driving a meaningful amount of the business for us through the boosted amps, and it's certainly an area that we're investing in to try to make such things better and better and especially louder over time.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill of Needham &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Rajvindra Gill</strong> -- <em>Needham &amp; Company -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the good execution on the boosted amplifier. So staying with that theme, can you talk about the share shifts that are happening in the amplifier market, particularly the Android market, your competitive advantage there and the fact that you are ramping with more models, how do we think about that as the total TAM and as a growth driver going into next year?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. Yes, so it's a key part of our growth, it has been a key part of our growth over the last, however, many years since we got into that market. We definitely expect it to be a meaningful part of the growth through ship and amplifiers to folks we haven't shipped amplifiers to previously. It's a little bit of a mix of taking share from other suppliers or competitors of ours and also selling amplifiers in the handsets that either didn't have an external boosted amp at all or just had a basic amplifier that was built into say, PMIC or so forth in somebody's chipset.</p>
<p>So as these kind of -- to the question earlier, to the point that we were making there, it's gotten harder to either maintain the amount of output volume that you previously had and also there is a real desire to have them be much louder in the first place with people having the use case that really like to be able to set the handset on the passenger seat of the car and use the speaker phone without monkeying around a bunch of Bluetooth and trying to get everything to work right to set the countdown (ph) and use it in speakerphone out. And that really does need to be pretty loud to pull that off. So that's why you've seen the migration to boosted amplifiers and then also the addition of stereo, which yes, those provide some degree of stereo separation but in larger part is about just making the overall handset to be much louder.</p>
<p>So it's -- specifically to your question, it's a bit of growth through addition of two separate boosted amps that didn't have before that changed to stereo and some of that's come at competitors expense, some of it's come via devices that just didn't have this product in them before at all.</p>
<p><strong>Rajvindra Gill</strong> -- <em>Needham &amp; Company -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>And we're seeing some Chinese OEMs start to adopt voice activation, voice trigger for -- that includes always-on voice. What's your positioning there, it seems that's a market where there's going to be a need for always-on ultra-low power voice processing, what's type is that?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. Yeah, we agree and that's certainly an interesting trend. We expect to benefit from that certainly more voice activation drive means that you need to be even more conscious about power than handset manufacturers already are. So that creates good opportunity for us. We're certainly ship in some of those models today. Generally speaking, it's a little higher end play and therefore while the flagship wins, we got a lot of notion and flash to them, they maybe don't drive as big of a business as the amplifiers might over time simply because, well, not everyone wants to differentiate on some of these more Esoteric speakers -- sorry -- Esoteric functions, everybody wants it to be a better phone in the better hands and a better speakerphone. So I would say the still in rank order the amplifiers and haptic are probably a bigger -- we expect them to be a bigger driver of revenue growth in the China market over the near term.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Blayne Curtis</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Jason and Thurman, I'm just curious, you have updated the fiscal guidance for two quarters here. I think December is down little over 20%. If you have any thoughts? I know you talked about Android win, but is there any update to the fiscal guide? That's question one.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, yes, December is down significantly. But that's because Q3 was kind of a significantly they are going to -- some of the two quarters, Q2 plus Q3 is largely in line with our previous expectations and I think pretty consistent with consensus as it relates to Q4, there's a lot of moving parts in that timeframe. I would say, whenever that happens, we like to be really conservative. And so I would say in that context maybe consensus is a little bit high relative to, if we had our druthers, and we were drawn up everybody's models, we'd probably lower that a bit. Just to give ourselves a little bit of space. But there's a lot of moving parts between now and then, the primary drivers, as I said in the opening remarks are just end customer handset demand, which we don't necessarily know yet.</p>
<p>And then also in the Q4 timeframe, we expect to get back to having a second customer that's over 10% and so the timing of that launch is also add some variability as it relates to Q4 versus Q1 of FY '20. And so those are kind of the remaining bits of variability and given all of that, we would just as usual try to be conservative and maybe drop a bit. But any range of things as possible, I think depending on how things go, we could potentially be significantly higher, we could potentially be significantly lower. Maybe not lower than your number, but consensus list.</p>
<p><strong>Blayne Curtis</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Jason, maybe you did mention -- you did talk about a little bit, but I wanted to follow up on haptics you mentioned taping out a specific part for it. Can you just walk us through the competitive landscape for haptics drivers and then your visibility in maintaining the sockets you have and then where do you see opportunities for this nature?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it's been pretty -- the concept has been pretty well received. I would say that the device we already have has been tremendously well received. It's Korea, it's China, it's really -- and as we've mentioned in the release, the North American customers are interested in that. The competitive landscape is pretty limited at the moment, because of the needs for ultra-low latency and some of the other real kind of nitty-gritty details, it's really helpful to have the DSP integrated into the amp and so that's less, if I think about our audio amp, competitors that's more in the NXP wheelhouse versus Maxim stuff generally is amplifier by itself and you need to do the signal processing elsewhere.</p>
<p>And there are certain customers for whom that's an appealing architecture. But for haptic, given the ultra-low latency and the feedback, it's really helpful to have the integrated DSP. So that kind of narrows it down a little bit to us and NXP. TI has got some products that are out there, it doesn't seem like all of our competitors focused on it early enough, it is I think the case that certainly one of our amplifier competitors had a bit of a circus going on over the past couple of years on the M&amp;A front, which I think maybe have there stood on this particular market.</p>
<p>But yeah, it's a very compelling opportunity and I'm certain everyone else won't ignore it. But at the moment it's -- that isn't the primary concern, when we roll in with customers, they are -- customers worry about well, if I go to a proper haptic actuator that does add cost not through our chip, so much as just a good haptic actuator is more expensive than an old-school vibration motor provides a completely night and day different experience but not everybody in the Android space is well under pay for while much of anything. But nonetheless, we're seeing that kind of customers across the Board are very, very interested in it. And then that -- this leads us to try to address things like overall system cost through integration of more of the capability, more of the things that are needed on the Boards, lowering passive component costs being able to do more in DSP, such that you can use a less expensive haptic actuator. Those are kind of some of the competitive trends in that space.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Rolland</strong> -- <em>Susquehanna -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey guys, just quickly on the second customer over 10%. Are you providing them enhanced or better features that you're already supplying? Or are these totally new features for that customer?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, it's kind of new functionality for us to ship them.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Rolland</strong> -- <em>Susquehanna -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Excellent. And then on amps, if you win one amp or you typically winning all of the amps in haptics in that phone and then also the amps that you're shipping now kind of, where are we in this 55-nanometer ramp, it kind of reads like a lot of the end points that you have might have been older stuff? Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, I'll try to do that in reverse order. Until -- we didn't have this new 55-nanometer amp with integrated DSP for the Android market. We didn't have that until about a year ago. So certainly, some of the wins in Android where we are with one or two of the older devices, that frankly, they really want the architect that well for Android. So we've really seen an uptick in Android design-ins following the launch of the 55-nanometer part with integrated DSP. Two, I forgot what your first question was.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Rolland</strong> -- <em>Susquehanna -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Sorry, my product (ph) team of IR professionals reminded me the first question was do we usually win the both of them. I'm unaware of any case where if somebody is actually doing stereo, where the amplifiers would get split either even among models of our own amps little alone across two different vendors that would really be complicated to manage. There are cases where customers do what we call receiver assisted stereo, which means they use a traditional receiver speaker for the earpiece like when you hold the phone up to your head, kind of speaker, and they'll play -- they'll filter out the base and play a little bit of the high-frequency stuff through that in speakerphone mode to try to give you a pseudo-stereo experience. And in that case we would only have one only amp, but it's a pretty uncommon solution to that. The haptic isn't necessarily connected from one competitive -- in a competitive situation. But certainly the more content you're shipping that gives you a lot more opportunity, most customers really like to have as few throats to choke as possible when it comes to developing their products. So if we're winning a stereo amplifier, so I got to say that gives us a leg up on the haptic slot and also vice versa. But they are not as directly connected as the stereo amp pair.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Adam Gonzalez of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Gonzalez</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just based on your disclosures, it looks like revenues outside of your largest customer implied down mid teens or so year-on-year and this is despite your comps from last year. Just wondering if you could remind us why that's still the case and when we can expect this to rebound as it when that second 10% customer comes back online, in Q4, could it be before that? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Thurman Case</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance</em></p>
<p>Yeah, that's dynamic, it's largely related to that same customer. And it's difficult to really get any visibility about it. Given that they are not currently at 10% outfit. So, yeah, it's largely related to that related to, so some of the larger Android customers that we've had of not had the most superb past couple of years, which has been a little bit of a challenge there.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Gonzalez</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. And then just my second question, can you just talk about some of the progress you've made in digital headsets, just remind us what some of the milestones, you've said anything that's on the horizon that we should be looking out for?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, we are shipping in more models as seems like a new one here and there. Over time, it really the Android space did not rush to the adoption of USB-C only or drop the headphone jack nearly as quickly as we thought they might. We do have some thoughts that in the over time, the 5G transition might actually impact that a bit. Because it does get pretty complicated from an antenna and radio perspective and turns out at those kind of frequency is having analog ports in your phone and in particular wires that are three meter, three feet long sticking how does not great from a -- and tenant perspective.</p>
<p>So we might see some catalyst there as that category customers figure out why that actually mattered a number of years ago, but it has been slower to progress than we expected, but nonetheless, we remain feeling pretty good about the product line that we've got and the offerings that we've got out there which are broader than they've ever been, and we are seeing good uptake of that from the customers that are choosing to launch such products. So it's probably I would say, relative to expectations a year or so ago amps and haptics are better than our expectations in that timeframe and headsets, probably a little bit lower, but we're still still working on trying to --.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson with Dougherty &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Anderson</strong> -- <em>Dougherty &amp; Company. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Jason, I think we're starting to see a few Chinese OEMs adopt these so-called smart mic with a single DSP core I guess voice -- voice activation sort of the thought there, I'm just sort of curious over the long term, what you see is that trend and the interplay between now and the codec. What capability they are looking for from the codec versus what they want to do out the (inaudible) you certainly have a mic business and we will participate to some degree, so just long-term trend architecturally, what are you seeing there?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, frankly that architecture doesn't make a lot of sense to us and the feedback we've gotten from most of our customers. It doesn't make a lot of sense for them either in most of these cases, where you are wanting to do any of that voice activation function, that's not a single mic system. And so why you would embed the DSP content there were, it actually, that there is no value, particularly in the adding it there, I suppose, unless you don't have a chance of winning the codec, so I would characterize the wins that we see in that business for them as a really pretty niche and to develop something in 55 nanometer to go after opportunities that also to us. Ee have made a lot of progress on the microphones. We do see a lot of opportunity to innovate in mics and turn them into something that's far more, far less of a commodity product, but it's not along those lines. In particular, I mean again, there's always an interesting niche here in there, it's a pretty broad market and so forth, but it's not a major driver that we're likely to go pursue at least not as far as the way they've differentiated that particular product.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Anderson</strong> -- <em>Dougherty &amp; Company. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, that's all I had. Thanks so much.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Rhode</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
