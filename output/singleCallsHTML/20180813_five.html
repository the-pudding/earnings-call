<p>Forward-looking statements represent only Five Point's estimate on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.

<p>These factors include those described in today's press release and Five Point's SEC filings including those in the Risk Factors section of the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Please note that Five Point assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Wetenhall, Executive Vice President of Capital Markets.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Wetenhall</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President</em></p>
<p>Welcome and good afternoon. For investors new to the story, I want to highlight that Five Point is an owner and developer of large mixed-use communities in California. Our communities are planned for more than 40,000 residential homes and 23 million square feet of commercial space in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Orange County.</p>
<p>I'm joined this afternoon by CEO, Emile Haddad; CFO, Erik Higgins; Chief Legal Officer, Mike Alvarado; and our Co-COOs, Kofi Bonner and Lynn Jochim. I'm now going to hand it off to Emile, who'll provide an overview of market conditions in California followed by a brief synopsis of our long-term strategy as well as a recap of second quarter results. Erik will then discuss our second quarter financial performance and liquidity.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Let me start by saying that the operating environment in our markets remains very favorable. After six years of strong job growth in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Orange County and a very limited number of new homes built, we are seeing pent-up demand driven by the compounded effect of the imbalance in supply and demand.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, the headlines in San Francisco and Los Angeles have been about the housing crisis. The lack of available land in the primary markets in California and the lengthy approval process will continue to constrain the supply of land available for development. This dynamic is what gives Five Point its competitive advantage. We control a substantial share of the land available for future development in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Orange County. Today, each of our communities is operational and our management team is in the process of unlocking the value contained in our irreplaceable land assets. Our management team has also stayed true to our long-term strategy for many years. Three points inform our strategy.</p>
<p>First, we have a dominant market share of available land in three of the strongest markets in the country in which there is very little supply. Second, we have a continuous focus on creating value by accelerating the virtuous cycle in our communities. This includes building state-of-the-art schools, amenities, and commercial uses that complement residential development. We also create value by opportunistically enhancing our entitlements. Third, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, which allows us to execute on our strategy.</p>
<p>The past quarter was simply another step toward advancing our strategy. In San Francisco, we received unanimous approval from the Board of Supervisors to add 2 million square feet of commercial space to our existing entitlement. The Board's action is another vote of confidence in our public-private partnership with the City of San Francisco and its commitment to transforming Candlestick Point and The San Francisco Shipyard into world-class mixed-use communities. We also continue to work on building infrastructure at Candlestick Point.</p>
<p>At Newhall, we continued working on developing the first phase of our community. Newhall is designed to include a total of 21,500 homes and 11.5 million square feet of commercial space. The first phase, which we refer to as Mission Village will include over 4,000 homesites and 1.6 million square feet of commercial space and we are on track to have our first deliveries to builders in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>At the Great Park, to date, we have sold 5,000 homesites representing approximately 50% of the 9,500 homesites for which we are currently approved. A sports complex more than twice the size of Disneyland has been completed and this summer so far, we have had 17 live concerts at our 12,000-seat amphitheater.</p>
<p>Finally, before I turn the call over to Erik for the financial update, let me address the issue of environmental testing at Hunters Point Shipyard, which has been in the news lately. Here are the facts as we know them. The Navy published its testing plan for the next parcel that is scheduled to be delivered to us. The plan is currently being reviewed by federal and state regulators and sometime within the next few days, the Navy is expecting to receive comments on the plan. Once that occurs, the Navy is expected to publish a schedule for testing. The Navy has also held several public briefing.</p>
<p>It is important, however, to reiterate what we have previously shared with the market. First, our focus for the next few years will be on Candlestick Point, which is not a decommissioned Navy base and thus is not subject to any Navy activity. Second, it is critical to reemphasize that our agreements with the City of San Francisco and the Navy require the Navy to deliver clean parcels with the appropriate sign-offs and that the Navy will stand behind their cleanup obligations.</p>
<p>With that, now let me turn it over to Erik and we will be happy to take your questions afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Erik Higgins</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer, Vice President</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Emile. A summary of our financial results was included in the earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. As we've discussed on previous calls, our consolidated financial results for the next few quarters will reflect our continued investment in planning and development activities at Newhall and Candlestick as we prepare these communities for land sales. Our results for the second quarter of 2018 reflect a land sale in Heritage Fields, which closed in May and continued inventory expenditures. As a reminder, our Newhall and San Francisco communities are consolidated on our financial statements while the Great Park Venture and the Gateway Commercial Venture are unconsolidated entities that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.</p>
<p>Revenues for the second quarter totaled $13.1 million and were primarily generated from management services. For our unconsolidated investments, which include our 37.5% investment in the Great Park Venture and our 75% investment in the Gateway Commercial Venture, we recognized a gain of $9 million, which was primarily due to our proportionate share of the Great Park Venture's net income for the quarter. Great Park Venture's net income was $37.5 million for the quarter, which resulted from the sale of 536 homesites on 33 acres. The base purchase price was $166 million or $5 million per acre and the gross margin at the partnership level was 30%. Five Point's 37.5% proportionate share of the Venture's $37.5 million net income was $14 million and after adjusting for the basis difference, our equity in the earnings of the Great Park Venture was $8.9 million.</p>
<p>Corporate and divisional SG&amp;A was $29 million for the quarter while interest income was $2.9 million. As a result, the net loss for the quarter was $11.3 million.</p>
<p>Now let me address some of the changes in our balance sheet during the second quarter. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $679 million. We had no outstanding borrowings under our corporate revolver, which results in liquidity of approximately $803 million. Total book capital at June 30th was $1.9 billion and our debt-to-total-capital ratio remained at 24%.</p>
<p>One last point, during the quarter, we facilitated an exchange of approximately 2 million operating company units per common shares. The result is a reclassification of approximately 26 million from our non-controlling interest line item up to members' capital. In addition, due to the company's increase in ownership of the operating company resulting from these exchanges and other tax attributes the company receives as a result of the exchanges, our liability under the tax receivable agreement increased by $15 million.</p>
<p>Let me turn it back to the operator now who will open it up for questions.</p>

</div><h2>Questions and Answers:</h2>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Przybylski</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yes, this is a Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. First, I was wondering if you could provide us any color on the Great Park and how the builders sell-through has been at Cadence, and if there is any change in demand by price point there or incentives or what kind of pricing power the builders are seeing?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Hi Paul, this is Emile. We're still seeing a very consistent performance by the builders at Cadence that we've experienced Parish Hall and Beacon. So from a sales rate point of view, so very much in line with expectations of past performance. We haven't heard anything from the builders in terms of any softening at the price point that we are selling at, at Cadence right now.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Przybylski</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay and recognizing that this really isn't part of your daily business, generally, what do you think is happening with the consumer and affordability, does that change your plans going forward as you bring these projects out of the ground with respect to density or price point along those lines? What kind of density or price points should we expect for the first phase at Newhall?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. So let me say first, I think that it is, it's very -- I think it's very dangerous to look at the housing market as one total housing market and apply one thought process across the country because there are certain markets that are much more sensitive right now to price points and the elasticity of movement. In our markets, because we are basically in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and Orange County, or in the primary market, we haven't seen really a softening of the demand as a result of any price movement and that's mainly because there is very little supply. However, we are constantly at the company looking at making sure that we don't push the envelope in terms of price points. So when we look at products, we are all the time thinking about products that are going to stay within a certain band of pricing that doesn't start pushing above a certain level. The word density is dangerous because we don't look at it only in terms of intensifying the product, but creating different type of creative products and lifestyle that goes with it. So the answer is, we're always looking at products to counter the price escalation that we see in order for us not to push the envelope on affordability.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Przybylski</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay and at Newhall, what -- I guess what consumer (inaudible) going to be your primary focus with Mission Village?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>We are seeing right now a lot of family as you can imagine, that's a big family community, if you are in LA and you're looking for good schools and an environment that is pretty much a family environment. You don't have a lot of options and that's what we cater to and we pulled from a for employment markets, we pulled from the Los Angeles market downtown, we pulled from San Fernando Valley, the studios in Burbank and we have a big local job market. Mainly family, we're right now in the process of developing our product over there and I think once we unveil that, you're going to see that we're introducing a product that's going to be very fresh and new to that marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Przybylski</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, would it be fair to assume that it's maybe a first move-up type product or a second move-up?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>I think it will be probably first and second move-up. I think that you will -- we will see that we will provide some opportunities for even first time home buyers with some of the products we're looking at right now. We're also seeing a lot of move-down in that market people who live in bigger homes in Valencia who are looking to stay within that area be close to their kids and family, but are looking for more of a product that is less maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Przybylski</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thank you. Appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Daley</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, this is actually Tim on for Nishu. Thanks for the time. So my first question is in regards to the deliveries out of Newhall that we're expecting for 4Q 2019, just since there is going to be one quarter of deliveries, could you help us get a better handle of the number of lots that are expecting to get put forth toward the builders next year?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, I mean I don't want to put out a number not because of anything because we are in the middle of land development and a lot of what is going to drive the number of homesites that will be delivered is how many homesites would we have ready for delivery. And as you can imagine, when we get into a rainy season and all that, that number is a little bit of a moving target. But if you're asking in terms of the demand, the demand is there in that marketplace and if we were able to produce 1,000 or 1,500 homesites, the market demand is there. So I don't want to give out the number now. As we get closer, I will be more comfortable giving a number, but it's going to be a very meaningful number of homesites.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Daley</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Understood, and then following up on that topic, so just curious as to -- thanks for this helpful color on Paul's question regarding the general demand that you're seeing in the market, but just curious, could you help us understand, I guess the split in terms of the foreign buyer demand because it tends to have a bit more exposure in your markets than on a national basis, I guess relative to kind of domestic demand that you will.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure, look, I think that you have to differentiate between actually foreign buyer and buyers with a foreign name and I think what we're seeing, for instance at the Great Park, is we're seeing a high percentage of buyers who have names that come from the Greater Asia, China, Korea, India, Pakistan and the Middle East. Those are not necessarily foreign buyers, Irvine [ph] has 40% of its population today is Asian. We're starting to see household formation out of that community and because of the way the culture works, a lot of these families are helping their kids buy home so they can stay close and the grandchildren gets close. So, if you're asking me what percentage of buyers have names that come from that part of the world, I would say, today we're probably about two-thirds, but if you're asking me if those are foreign buyers as investors, we don't have a lot of those.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Daley</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Understood, thanks, appreciate the color. And then I guess just one final quick one is, do you guys have any update for us on the Macerich JV, obviously the plans changed a little bit recently, just curious as to any kind of forward-looking guidance you could provide with us in regards to that project.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, I think in the last quarter we shared with all of you that we are working with Macerich and we are rethinking that whole area. One of the things that we want to make sure of is that we are building a product for the future and because of where the retail world is right now, we don't want to go ahead and stay on autopilot and find ourselves building a product that might not be the right product. So we're spending a lot of time in planning and thinking about what do we want to do over there. That's a very unique piece of land on the water in San Francisco and you want to maximize its value by making sure that whatever we build over there is right. So we're spending a lot of time thinking through that and I think that sometime within the coming probably quarter or two, we'll have more clarity on what happens over there. In the meanwhile, we are still going forward in putting the infrastructure needed. So, yes, it's not impacting the critical path per se, but we want to make sure that we think through it before we pull the trigger on whatever we're going to build.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Daley</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Understood and look forward to seeing the progress there. Thanks for the time.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Michael Eisen with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Eisen</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Good afternoon. Thank you guys for taking the questions. Just wanted to start off, on the commercial side of your business, you guys have put up two pretty consistent quarters. I just wanted to touch on it, if you can give us any update of occupancy rates from those properties, what you think of the run rate the lease agreements coming in on a quarterly basis might be and how you see this growing over time.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>So, we haven't given any update because we haven't had really any new leases signed up on the Five Point Gateway, the one that we announced, which used to be referred to as the Broadcom project. And we have right now two buildings, out 1 million square feet, 650,000 square feet are already leased to Broadcom and that's a long-term lease and a building is going to be leased almost -- most of it is going to be leased to both Lennar and Five Point for our headquarters and then we have a building that we are in the process of talking to potential tenants on. 77% of the total project is already leased up. So that's why we haven't given any update because we haven't had any real change. In terms of our plans, as we have shared with the market in the past, we will be building more of our commercial portfolio, we have, besides the Macerich opportunity, which has been discussed and the areas around Macerich, which are all income producing, we also have a community at the Great Park that's a commercial village that is in process with the city. So you should expect us to be updating you and talking about the growth of our segment or that segment of the business over the coming year or two.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Eisen</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. And then when thinking of the entitlement you guys are granted in San Francisco for additional commercial space there. Do you guys have any view on what the timing of that development may look like and as we think about that lapping in, would that be considered something you'd want to put into the commercial segment or would that still specifically be in San Francisco results?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, though, I think that we right now -- and Erik will correct me if I'm wrong, we will be reporting on the commercial segment as one segment. So it will be a separate segment that would include all commercial in all of our communities. So as we start building up the commercial in San Francisco, it will be reported with the commercial segment. In terms of the plans for that, obviously, that reflects the need for commercial and office in San Francisco right now and the job housing balance that we're trying to create within the community. The entitlements have a certain level or a great amount of fungibility to them in terms of where we put them and that will all be informed through planning and the right way of mixing the uses together. So we got the approvals, we are going through the process of the planning including Macerich and everything that surround it and we will be utilizing that -- those additional entitlement as the plan take shape.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Eisen</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Understood and then just one more if I could, just looking at the Great Park and some of the new products that you guys have launched in the last month or two, can you give any indication of the absorption pace on those new lots and whether there's any need to accelerate or fluctuate the current development plan you guys have to help meet build their demand.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>No there hasn't been. Actually we -- the way we actually deliver homesites is we deliver the home sites in a very optimized way where we like to have a certain amount of absorption that gives us the balance between speed and pricing. And because we've been selling homes or builders have been selling homes, we've been able to measure the number of homesites to be delivered on a periodic basis and make sure that we do not oversupply the market or under-supply the market. So we have not seen a need for us to adjust the pace of delivery to the builders which is driven by their pace of delivery to the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Daley</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Understood, thanks for all the information and good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman &amp; Associates. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Ratner</strong> -- <em>Zelman &amp; Associates -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey guys, good afternoon. So I guess Emile, just on that same topic for the Great Park, I think last quarter you mentioned that you were still planning or thinking about doing another round of lot sales in the Great Park (technical difficulty) maybe another 500 lots. Is that still on track?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, it is (inaudible) and we have seen a very consistent pace and we are planning on having another delivery of homesites sometime toward the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Ratner</strong> -- <em>Zelman &amp; Associates -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, great. And then just in terms of the cash distribution from the Great Park, I believe, there has been a distribution made to the legacy holders. What's the current expectation for distributions to start flowing through to Five Point?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, right now based on our schedule of delivery of homesites to builders and therefore satisfying that legacy we're probably looking at the first quarter or sometime in 2020 for the first distribution. That could move up or down based on our decision as to whether we want to accelerate or decelerate delivery of homesites to builders.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Ratner</strong> -- <em>Zelman &amp; Associates -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Is it triggered by like once you reach a certain milestone of how many lots have been sold? And can you talk a little bit just about how we should think about both the magnitude of that?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>No, it's actually a certain amount of cash that is the priority distribution to the legacy, once we hit that point, then the distribution will go pari passu to Five Point and the other partners. And we are right now about $210 million away from satisfying that out of the $560 million, approximately $560 million were the -- was the priority distribution amount and we're down to $210 million.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Ratner</strong> -- <em>Zelman &amp; Associates -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. Okay, that's helpful, thank you. And then just if I could squeeze in one more, just on the development side. So if I look at just the inventory line item on your balance sheet, it's up about $120 million year-to-date and it looks like your cash usages in the ballpark is a similar amount. Presumably that reflects both the Newhall and the San Francisco developments that's been under way since there haven't really been any offsets on the revenue line. So, is this a decent run rate to think about kind of quarterly or biannually what the cash expenditure should be or is it going to be much lumpier than we've seen over the past two quarters.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>No, I think you should expect it to be pretty much consistent with that. We are now in full gear at Newhall and San Francisco. We also have a sort of like a smooth path of infrastructure. I say that with a caveat that obviously if we end up with some weather conditions or things like that, that might create more lumpiness, but I think that's a good number to look at in terms of your run rate.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Ratner</strong> -- <em>Zelman &amp; Associates -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, that's helpful and then just if I could squeeze in one more just for an update on Newhall, I know there were a couple of groups I think that were not included in the settlement that you reached, it looks like they haven't really been a factor since things are progressing there, but is there any reason to believe that at some point they might be successful in stopping the process?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Wetenhall</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President</em></p>
<p>Well, no, I mean look, I'm not going to answer it from a legal point of view because the system still allows people to make attempts and there have been a couple of attempts made and we beat them in court, but we are extremely confident with the fact that we are now in an uninterrupted process. We have moved so far 15 million cubic yards and we are, as I said, we're really moving toward the delivery. So within the hallways of Five Point, we are very confident that we are up and running right now.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Ratner</strong> -- <em>Zelman &amp; Associates -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Right -- alright, good luck guys.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Kim</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Thanks very much guys. Yes, a few questions. Emile, first of all, I was wondering if you could talk about the testing at the naval base that's due to take place, do you have any idea when we might get the results back from that and do you have most likely and obviously, hopefully it comes back negative, but do you have a contingency plan in case it comes back positive?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. First of all, as I said, all we know is that the Navy has put together a plan and send it to the regulators for review and they are expecting some public comments sometime I think this week. Once they receive all the feedback, the Navy has basically inform us and they've been talking about publicly that they will then publish the testing plan. We expect the testing to be probably several months and then -- whatever it takes to analyze the data. As I said before, Stephen, one is the Navy is responsible to deliver clean parcels to us. So assuming that there is anything that comes back into testing, our expectation is that the Navy will go back and take care of those areas and make sure that they get the sign off and we will not be taking any parcels down until all that process goes through. In terms of the contingency plan, actually the contingency plan was put in place a while ago, way before this issue of testing came up and that is by shifting our focus to Candlestick. Candlestick was never a Navy base, and therefore it's -- doesn't have any testing, it doesn't have any contamination and it's not subject to any potential delays as a result of that. All our focus right now is on Candlestick and candidly I think for the coming probably five years to six years all development activities will be taking place in Candlestick. So we, as much as we're watching what happens and we obviously want to make sure we get now clarity from the Navy in terms of timing of deliveries, we expect that our focus will be on Candlestick and none of what's happening with the Navy will impact our business plan.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Kim</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Right, that's good to hear. Shifting over to Newhall, you mentioned, I guess first of all, I was curious as to whether or not the fires you've been hearing about have impacted you at all and also I noticed in Newhall, you mentioned weather or rain a couple of times and I was curious if you were thinking that, if there's anything to know about or just if you're thinking it evolving with respect to weather-related issues in the long-term plan around Newhall?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>First of all, the fires have not impacted us. They are not close to us and the reason I mentioned weather is not because I have concerns about weather, but because of the amount of movement of dirt right now and the amount of area and we actually will be posting some pictures hopefully maybe for the next call so at least people on the call will get a feel for the size and the magnitude of the land development operation. Because we have a lot of area opened up, I always have the caveat of weather because if it rains heavily for a week that means you're going to have a delay of a week or two until it get dries up, so you can go back and start working on land development. But we're not expecting any other delays, the fires have not impacted us and I am very optimistic that we are going to go through next year and deliver homesites and you all will be really supplying a lot of -- well needed supply of housing in LA County.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Kim</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, that's helpful. That's great, thanks for clarifying and then also with respect to an earlier question, I think you were sort of holding off giving a number around what kind of deliveries you think you're going to get at the end of next year for Mission Village, but in the past you'd given a range of I think you had 500 to maybe 1,000 or something and today you sort of threw out a 1,000, 1,500 even though you weren't endorsing that number. I guess should we at least take away from your comments that it is -- your view is that you probably will not have fewer than the 500 you had talked about previously?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, I don't expect to have any less than the 500 as I said, assuming we don't end up with a surprising season and rainy season that might delay some of the infrastructure, but we don't expect less than that. And again, Stephen, when you look at land development, I know we keep on talking about reporting within periods of quarters and years, in land development, we could actually be delivering a certain number of homesites by the end of 2018 or 2019, but then a quarter or two later, we might deliver few hundreds on site. So it's going to be within a certain period, but if you're trying to create a cutoff of a year end, it's going to be few hundred.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Kim</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yes, OK. And then in Great Park, I think the numbers that we were looking at suggested that the 536 sites you sold were at about $310 million [ph] a lot, was curious as to, first of all that number is right and then what was the mix of attached versus detached homes that drove that?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, Lynn is going to look that up, it was a mixture of attached and detached, but as you can tell from the price per acre of -- the $5 million price per acre, it's not a big area from an acreage point of view, when you look at it in terms of thinking 533. So it's a higher density product, again goes back to answering the question of affordability, but Lynn, do you have a break down? Why don't you keep on going Stephen, we'll look up the answer in a second.</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Jochim</strong> -- <em>Co-Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>I am looking.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Why don't you keep on going Stephen, we'll look up the answer in a second.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Kim</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yes and also in Great Park, I think in our numbers, we had been assuming that there was going to be another sale later this year roughly equivalently size from a lot perspective, is that kind of what you're still thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Yes, that's what we're thinking. And so we have the breakdown. I'm going to give it to you in product type, just because sometimes people characterize certain products as attach, sometimes characterize them as detach. So we have one product that's in 11-plex and we have (inaudible), we have duplexes, triplexes and town homes and then 8 pack. Does that help you?</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Kim</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay. Yes, definitely, very high density, that's kind of -- the sale later this year, should we be thinking that that would be a little bit more single-family detached or would it be a similar kind of mixture?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>The answer to -- before I go with -- let me just give you another maybe way to look at what you were asking for before I answer that question, our density goes from about, call it 13 to an acre to 32 to an acre on the homesites that were sold before. The answer to your question is, that's what we do. We monitor right now what the sales base is of the builders and we try to dovetail a product type to a product that's selling out. So I think it's going to be a mixture, but it will be all dependent on which of the product types are selling out and that's what we bring to the market.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Kim</strong> -- <em>Evercore -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay great. Thanks very much guys. That's very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong> -- <em>-- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hey, this is (inaudible) for Mike. I guess at a high level, maybe can you talk a bit about some other opportunities you might have identified or finding attractive maybe early stage outside of your current portfolio?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>We haven't announced anything. So I'm not going to talk about anything we have not announced yet, but I can tell you that we are in process of a couple of opportunities where as we said before our new opportunities will come from people who will approach us to partner with them for redevelopment and repurposing of space and I can tell you that there was a couple of those type of opportunities we're looking at, but I'm not in a position to discuss them yet, one of them has been put out. We haven't spoken about it, but Cal state Pomona has announced that they have picked us to be their potential developer. We are right now in an exclusive live [ph] negotiate process with them to develop a parcel they own next to the campus, which will have residential as well as commercial and it'll have student housing and we view that as a great opportunity and we view it as, again a big statement in terms of a university picking us to be their selected developer on the parcel they own. So those are the type of opportunities I think you're going to hear us talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong> -- <em>-- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Okay, that makes sense. And I guess given the profit sharing you do with the builders and your comments earlier on pricing, I guess what's the latest you're hearing from builders on the cost side?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Well, I mean I've been in this business for 35 years, builders always whine about costs. So this is not new. Well, I've just -- you have to add some levity to the call, right. Look, it's not a secret that we're hearing from builders that they're starting to see a lot of pressure on the cost side and that they're trying to go through all type of processes on that. One of the things that I can tell you that's worked well for us with the builders and I actually was having a discussion with one of the builders about that is because we have an ability to provide builders with a longer runway of homesites to be sold to them over several years as they go from one product to another, the feedback I'm getting from some of the builders is that's enabling them to negotiate a better price structure because it's not about a short-term contract on one neighborhood, but rather it's a commitment to a longer-term process, and that's really where the relationship with the builders helps both.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Participant</strong> -- <em>-- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Got it. That's all from me. Appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schrier with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Schrier</strong> -- <em>Citigroup -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask one question and a little bit of a follow-up on the costs you were just talking about, but more on the commercial side, I'm curious what you're seeing in the market and how you're thinking about your development from a yield on cost perspective taking into account your potential to get the NOI that you want to get on some of these investments versus what you're going to have to pay for it. So if you can just put some parameters around how you think about yield on cost and the attractiveness of the commercial assets at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>So the way we, OK, if I'm going to give you a general answer, it will be 2% above cap rate is what we usually target, but we own the land that we are going to be building on, so there is also that factor that you have to think of in terms of how do we cost the land to the commercial entity. Second thing is, we look at commercial not only as a stand-alone performer, but as a value add creator for a larger master plan. So when we look at a commercial opportunity, we are benefiting from both hitting the right targets of return on a stand-alone, but also what that amenity or that commercial use might do to creating a premium for the balance of the homesites that we're selling. So we tend to look at our commercial approach a little bit different than somebody who is just looking at it as a one at a time because of that. Just to refresh your memory on the Broadcom opportunity as much as we can look at the stand-alone return of the -- what we paid versus the leases we get and what that return looks like, we also captured back entitlements that we took back to the Great Park neighborhood that could be converted to as much as 1,000 homes if we were to go all residential. So there are these type of opportunities that we look at, that might actually not be evident in a yield, but they have huge value for us.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Schrier</strong> -- <em>Citigroup -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Great. Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Przybylski</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo. -- Analyst</em></p>
<p>Yes, this is Paul on for Stephan again. I was wondering if you could add some color on what you're seeing with respect to horizontal development inflation? And then also given your lack of development experience at Newhall with the work done to-date. how does that compare with the original budget?</p>
<p><strong>Emile Haddad</strong> -- <em>Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer</em></p>
<p>Sure. So let me just start maybe at the end, I mean we might not have been in land development for a while at Newhall but we have a lot of experience developing up there -- the company of the developed all of -- the City of Valencia and we developed (inaudible), so we have a lot of expertise in terms of what to expect in land development. But more importantly, to answer your question about inflation, because of the nature of our development, because we now at Newhall for example have a commitment to grading contract because that is a long-term commitment. We have the luxury of negotiating price structures, that are long-term price structures that somebody else might not be able to get. So we have not really seen any price pressure or cost on pressure in terms of land development. We usually factor in your typical cost of living escalation, but we haven't seen any real surge in cost on land development, as I said, because of our dominance in the marketplace we're in.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Przybylski</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo. -- Analyst</em></p>
