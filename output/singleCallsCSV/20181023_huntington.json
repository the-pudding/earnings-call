(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations.\nMark Muth -- Director, Investor Relations\nThank you, Sherry. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.\nOur presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call.\n(Forward-Looking Cautionary Statements)\nLet me now turn it over to Steve.\nStephen D. Steinour -- Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had another very good quarter and as we continue to deliver high-quality earnings and expect to carry this momentum through the end of the year. It was also another clean quarter, as for the third quarter in a row, there were no significant items. We reported net income of $378 million and earnings per share $0.33, increases of 37% and 43% respectively over the third quarter of 2017.\nReturn on common equity was 14% and return on tangible common equity was 19%. We had record revenue of $1.2 billion, which represented a 5% year-over-year increase and maintained strong expense discipline. We're pleased with the resulting efficiency ratio of 55.3%, an improvement of 520 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The average total loan increase was strong at 7% versus the third quarter of 2017 and 5% annualized versus this 2018 second quarter. This loan growth was driven by a 10% year-over-year increase in average consumer loans, with particular strength in residential mortgage, RV and marine financing and automobile lending. We remain focused on core funding the balance sheet with 6% growth in average core deposits.\nIn the third quarter, we increased the quarterly common dividend to $0.14 per share, representing a 27% linked quarter increase and a 75% year-over-year increase. This year marks the eighth consecutive year that we've increased the common dividend. We believe our earnings power, capital generation and risk management discipline will support higher dividends, including a higher dividend payout ratio over time. We also repurchased $691 million of common shares or approximately 65% of the total repurchase included in our 2018 CCAR capital plan.\nAs briefly outlined on slide three, we developed Huntington strategies with the vision of creating a high performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through-the-cycle shareholder returns. Our profitability metrics are among the best in the industry and we have built sustainable competitive advantages in our key businesses that we believe will deliver high performance in the future. The franchise continues to perform well in many fronts, allowing us to make investments and capabilities we need to drive consistent organic growth. We're focused on driving sustained long-term performance for our shareholders. We remain committed to our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite, which we put in place eight years ago. As a reminder, we reinforced the importance of these standards by requiring the top 1400 officers of the company to comply with hold-to-retirement restrictions on their equity awards.\nSlide four illustrates our long-term financial goals, which were approved by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. As a reminder, these goals were originally set with a five-year time horizon in mind and we fully expect to achieve these goals this year on a reported GAAP basis, two years ahead of original expectations. I've already touched on our record revenues, the continued expense discipline and our third quarter efficiency ratio, which was below the low end of our long-term goal. In addition to our credit metrics, our credit metrics remain excellent. The third quarter 2018 was the 17th consecutive quarter where net charge-offs remained below our average through-the-cycle target range and loan provisions in excess of net charge-offs have been taken in 12 of the last 13 quarters. Our 19% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top performing regional bank. Now, these results demonstrate that our strategies are clearly working and will continue to drive Huntington forward.\nSo let's turn to slide five to review 2018 expectations and discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. The local economies across our eight-state footprint continue to perform well, and we remain optimistic on the near-term outlook. Unemployment rates remain near historical lows, and we continue to see labor shortages throughout our footprint markets. The Midwest, in fact, has the highest job opening rate in the nation so far in 2018. The our major regions of the country, the Midwest is the most dynamic region for potential jobs growth according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics August JOLTS survey. The employment and growth opportunities in Midwest continue to make it a favorable economic region. Six of our eight footprint states experienced net population in migration in 2017. In fact, 2017 was the first year Ohio had net immigration in a quarter of a century.\nAs shown on slide 70 in the appendix, the Philadelphia Fed's state leading economic indicator indices for our footprint, point toward a favorable economic operating environment for the next six months. While the impact of the ongoing tariff issues, some positive and some negative can be seen in specific industries, we've not yet seen a material impact to our customer base overall. The uncertainty regarding NAFTA was far more impactful to our customer base and our footprint. And we're encouraged by the new USMCA trade agreement as we believe it will be beneficial to our footprint, especially within the auto industry. Customer optimism has materialized throughout 2018, as we've seen our customers invest in capital expenditures and grow their businesses. Our commercial pipeline is up year-over-year. Consumers are doing well, with consumer loan growth remaining steady. It's a good time to be doing business in the Midwest and we remain bullish on our local economies.\nNow moving to our updated 2018 expectations. We expect the full year average loan growth rate -- growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, consistent with our year-over-year growth for the first nine month. For the fourth quarter, it provides a challenging comparison, given the significant amount of growth at the end of last year following the federal tax reform, loan growth rate in the third quarter and so far in October have been encouraging. Full year average deposit growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, while full-year growth in average core deposits is expected to be 4.5% to 5.5%. We remain focused on acquiring core checking accounts and deepening core deposit relationships.\nWe expect full-year revenue growth of 4% to 4.5% and during the fourth quarter, we expect to realize approximately $20 million of security losses related to a portfolio restructuring. This will allow us optimize the securities portfolio, improving the revenue outlook for 2019. The modest reduction in our 2018 revenue outlook is related to the cost of the portfolio restructure -- restructuring, as all remaining aspects of our prior revenue expectations remain intact. We continue to project the GAAP NIM for the full year will expand by two basis points to four basis points compared to 2017. We expect NIM expansion in the fourth quarter on a GAAP and core basis will be in the range of four basis points to six basis points.\nWe will deliver positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. We expect a 2% to 2.5% decrease in non-interest expense on a GAAP basis. Full year expenses are now projected to be slightly higher than previous guidance as we expect to incur approximately $40 million of expense in the fourth quarter related to the recently announced consolidation of 70 branches and some additional corporate facilities. The run rate cost savings associated with these consolidations will be entirely redeployed into targeted investments in both people and technology, and specifically, digital and mobile technology. We anticipate the net charge-offs will remain below our average through the cycle target range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Our expectations for the full year 2018 effective tax rate is in 14.5% to 15% range.\nAnd before I turn it over to Mac, I'd like to give you a quick update on the strategic planning process we began earlier in the year. We are excited about the progress we've made and the meaningful discussion steered by our Board of Directors, the executive leadership team and many dedicated colleagues in Huntington.\nIn September, we had a three-day board off-site to further refine a decision, the strategic plan and last week, the Board had another robust set of conversations as we're nearing completion of the plan. As we previously mentioned, we anticipate new long-term financial goals will be an important outcome of the new strategic plan and we look forward to sharing those with you later this year.\nSo Mac will now provide an overview of our financial performance. Mac?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. Slide six provides the highlights of the third quarter results. As Steve mentioned, we had a strong third quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.33, up 43% over the year-ago-quarter. Adjusting for $31 million of acquisition related significant items in the third quarter of 2017, core EPS was up $0.08 or 32% year-over-year. We are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing across all of our businesses as evidenced by our 5% year-over-year revenue growth and our 55.3% efficiency ratio, down 520 basis points from the year ago quarter. Return on assets was 1.4%, return on common equity was 14% and return on tangible common equity was 19%.\nWe believe, all three of these metrics distinguish Huntington among our regional bank peers. Tangible book value per share increased 3% year-over-year, to $7.06, even with a considerable share repurchase in the quarter. Lastly, the tax rate was 14.1% during the third quarter, which was impacted by a $3 million benefit from stock based compensation and a $3 million benefit related to the tax cuts in Jobs Act.\nTurning now to slide seven, average earning assets grew 4% from the third quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by a 7% growth in average loans and leases, including broad-based strength in consumer lending. Average residential mortgage loans increased 22% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in loan officers, as well as further expansion into the Chicago market. As we typically do, we sold the agency-qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained the jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.\nAverage C&I loans increased 4% year-over-year, with growth centered in middle market, asset finance, energy and corporate banking. On an end-of-period basis, C&I balances increased 5% linked quarter annualized as we saw a healthy pickup in originations in the final months of the quarter. Average auto loans increased 6% year-over-year as a result of consistent and disciplined loan production. Originations totaled 1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2018, down 15% year-over-year. This was deliberate as we have been consistently increasing auto loan pricing, which slowed originations while optimizing revenue. The average new money yield on our auto originations was 4.62% in the quarter, up 40 basis points from 4.22% in the second quarter and up 100 basis points from 3.62% in the year ago quarter.\nAverage RV and marine loans increased 31% year-over-year, reflecting the success of the well-managed expansion of the business and the 17 new states over the past two years. Linked quarter growth was 52% annualized, reflecting the normal seasonality during the summer months. Average commercial real estate loans were down 1% on a year-over-year basis and down 3% on a linked quarter basis. This reflects anticipated pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of commercial real estate lending, specifically in multi-family, retail and construction, in order to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital. Finally, securities were down 3% year-over-year as we continue to let the portfolio run off and remix the cash flows in the higher yielding loan products.\nTurning now to slide eight, average total deposits grew 5% year-over-year, including a 6% increase in average core deposits. Core certificates of deposit were up 141% from the year ago quarter, reflecting the initiatives during the past three quarters to grow the fixed rate term consumer deposits in light of the rising interest rate environment. Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 9% year-over-year, while average non-interest-bearing DDA deposits decreased 7%. This was almost entirely driven by our commercial customers as they continue to shift from non-interest-bearing to interest bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market.\nHowever, as shown on slide 37 in the appendix, our core consumer and non-interest-bearing deposits were actually up 5% year-over-year, as we continue to grow households and deepen relationships. Average money market deposits were up 6% year-over-year driven by solid growth in consumer balances and preferences of commercial customers shifting toward higher yielding products. On a linked quarter basis, total deposits grew $2.2 billion or 3%, reducing our average short-term borrowings in the quarter by 44%. We remain focused on core funding the balance sheet in the current rising interest rate environment.\nMoving now to slide nine. Our net interest income increased $39 million or 5% versus the year ago quarter. Driving this growth was the 4% increase in earning assets and rising yields in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Our GAAP net interest margin was 3.32% for the third quarter, up three basis points from the year ago quarter and up three basis points linked quarter. The third quarter was impacted by a slower rise in short-term rates, as average one month LIBOR increased 14 basis points during the quarter versus 63 basis points in the first half of the year. We do not anticipate the same headwind in the fourth quarter.\nMoving to slide 10, our core net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.25%, up seven basis points from the year ago quarter and up three basis points linked quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed seven basis points to the net interest margin compared to 12 basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 33 in the appendix provides information regarding this scheduled impact of first merit purchase accounting accretion for 2018 and 2019.\nOn the earning asset slide, our commercial loan yields increased 59 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 22 basis points. Our deposit costs remain well contained, with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 73 basis points for the quarter, up 38 basis points year-over-year. Consumer core deposit costs were up 26 basis points year-over-year and commercial core deposit costs were up 27 basis points.\nMoving now to slide 11, our cycle-to-date deposit beta remains low at 28% through the third quarter of 2018, which is still well below our expectations. Our CD funding strategy negatively impacted our deposit beta in the second and third quarters. Our core deposit growth continues to outpace peers. And we will be better positioned for continued interest rate increases in the future. As we told you last quarter, overall deposit pricing remains rational in our markets.\nSlide 12 provides detail on our non-interest income for the quarter and comparisons with the year ago quarter. Our non-interest income increased 12 million or 4% from the third quarter of 2017. We're seeing momentum in our fee businesses, driven by our ongoing household and relationship acquisition and the execution of our strategies including our optimal customer relationship strategy.\nSlide 13 highlights the key drivers in our 4% year-over-year reduction in reported non-interest expense. Comparisons to the third quarter of 2017 are impacted by $31 million of acquisition related significant items in the year ago quarter. We remain focused on expense control, while also investing in our key businesses. Our efficiency ratio has trended down, reflecting the successful cost save initiatives from the FirstMerit acquisition.\nSlide 14 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. Tangible common equity end the quarter at 7.25%, down 17 basis points year-over-year. Common equity Tier 1, end of the quarter at 9.89%, down five basis points year-over-year and down 64 basis points linked quarter. CET1 is now back within our operating guideline of 9% to 10%. We expect to stay there, the upper end of this range given the length of the current recovery and where we believe we are in the economic cycle.\nSlide 15 illustrates our previously articulated capital priorities, which have been confirmed during the current strategic planning process. Our first priority is to fund organic growth of the balance sheet. Our second priority is the cash dividend. As Steve mentioned earlier, we were pleased to be able to increase our cash dividend materially this quarter. This was enabled by the significant improvement in capital generation driven over the past few years and our strong results in the DFAST and CCAR processes. Our final capital priorities everything else, which includes share repurchases and selective M&A.\nOur $691 million share repurchase during the third quarter included a $400 million ASR. We use the ASR to effectively offset the dilution incurred during the first quarter from our Series A preferred equity conversion, as was contemplated in our CCAR submission. Excluding the one-time nature of this ASR, the total payout ratio this year would look closer to our long-term payout ratio targets, versus the elevated 112% year-to-date payout ratio shown on the slide. Recall we have previously stated that we have a long-term total payout ratio target of 70% to 80% and a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 45%. We continue to view whole bank M&A as unattractive use of capital at this time, given the highly inflated seller's expectations and where we believe we are in the economic cycle.\nEarlier this month, we closed on the previously announced acquisition of Hutchinson, Shockey, Erley & Co., a small specialty broker dealer with expertise in municipal underwriting. This is a small bolt-on acquisition, which is a nice addition to our government banking and capital markets business.\nMoving to slide 16, credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We booked loan loss provision expense of 49 million in the third quarter, compared to net charge-offs of 29 million. The loan loss provision expense in the quarter reflected the strong loan growth and continued migration of the acquired FirstMerit portfolio into the originated portfolio. We have now booked provision expense above net charge-offs for 12 of the past 13 quarters, illustrating our high-quality earnings.\nNet charge-offs represented an annualized 16 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our average through the cycle target range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were flat from the prior quarter and down nine basis points from the year ago quarter. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans increased two basis points linked quarter to 1.04%, while the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans also increased two basis points linked quarter to 1.17%\nSlide 17 highlights Huntington's strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The graph in the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue as a result of focused execution of our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to support balance sheet growth and return capital to our shareholders at an advantaged rates over the long term. The top right chart highlights the well balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both the consumer and commercial bank and believe that the diversification of this balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle. Our DFAST stress test results in the bottom left highlight our disciplined enterprise risk management and finally, the bottom right demonstrates Huntington's strong capital position.\nTurning now to slide 18, this new slide highlights Huntington's continued investment in our customer experience advantage, with a focus on human-led technology enabled delivery and solutions. We are seeing an ongoing shift toward mobile and digital usage by our customers. 62% of our households are digitally active and we would expect that figure will continue to increase materially in the years to come. On the top right of the slide, you can see a few of the most recent mobile and digital initiatives. As you can imagine, the current strategic planning process has a significant focus on digital and mobile technology and we will share more details once the plan is finalized. We remain focused on extending our customer experience advantage through targeted investment.\nAs previously announced, we are consolidating 70 branches and a handful of corporate facilities in the fourth quarter. The strategic decision to consolidate these offices is the result of our continuous review of our distribution channels and our customers' perceptions, behaviors and needs. The run rate cost -- savings associated with these consolidations will be entirely deployed into targeted investments in technology, specifically digital, in order to better serve our customers.\nLet me now turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions.\nMark Muth -- Director, Investor Relations\nThanks, Mac. Sherry will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nKen Usdin, Jefferies.\nKenneth Usdin -- Jefferies LLC -- Analyst\nMac, wondering if you can just help us flush out the incremental securities laws and then the incremental charges on your previously announced restructuring charges and may be even more so then understanding the fourth quarter-- help us understand the return on those and how we should expect that to affect the '19 starting points for both the securities portfolio yield and also just for the cost base? Thanks.\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo we're selling about 1.1(ph)billion of investment securities in the fourth quarter and we will replace those one for one. So there won't be an increase in the securities portfolio from this action. You know, basically, it's a shorter duration low-yielding securities and the payback is pretty quick, under two years on this transaction. We're going to get a net yield pickup of about 1.2%, which should translate into about $13 million in additional net interest income in 2019. So we just see this as good hygiene and continuing to make sure that we stay efficient with the balance sheet and think about opportunities.\nOn the expense side, so this is basically related to the 70 branch consolidations that will take place in the fourth quarter and there will be some corporate facilities that we will be closing consolidating as part of that as well. And we estimate that to be approximately $40 million and it would be the typical expenses that you see in these types of activities. And when you think about the 2018 guidance and the change to the 2018 guidance for both revenue and expense, these items impacted those changes to a very large degree, entirely on the expense side and primarily on the revenue side. So we shouldn't think about this really has been a change in core guidance for 2018. This is really about these actions that we're taking in the fourth quarter.\nKenneth Usdin -- Jefferies LLC -- Analyst\nAnd my follow-up, Mac, just on that expense point, if I follow you on that and just put in the $40 million on the expense side, which still seem that underlying that you're still expecting a decent increase in kind of underlying cost growth third to fourth. Can you just level set us on that versus the $651 million result you just put up, the type of underlying expense growth you're still expecting in 4Q? Thanks.\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Ken, so it is somewhat seasonal. We do have higher expenses in the fourth quarter. I would tell you, there's not anything out of the ordinary relative to what we've seen historically in the fourth quarter, just the fact that we do have higher revenue because of seasonal actions taken place in the fourth quarter by our customers and expenses that come along with them.\nOperator\nJon Arfstrom, RBC Capital Markets.\nJon Arfstrom -- RBC Capital Markets, LLC -- Analyst\nQuestion on lending, when you talk about your pipelines and the outlook. This mid-single digit pace that you guys have put up may be even a little bit better. Steve, I'm just curious, longer term, do you see any threats to that or do you feel like that's a sustainable pace for the company?\nStephen D. Steinour -- Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nWe are sitting with a pipeline that's largely equivalent to where we were this time last year, on both the consumer and commercial side. As we look forward, we're bullish on the economy in our footprint. There's certainly a lot of macro volatility right now so that could impact things, but we're optimistic and getting the NAFTA risk off the table is a big step forward for us in this region.\nUnderlying commercial demand seems if anything be triggered by -- the constraint on employment and we have many, many customers throughout all of our regions now suggesting that they could do more if they had more labor. So there is a -- clearly, a labor supply impact going on. Then additionally -- then out quite a bit and have had a lot of commentary about pipelines now going into 2020. So, it would appear to be -- that it would appear that business is consistent and to be at this time of the year with backlogs into 2020 is a bit unusual, so very positive together(ph).\nJon Arfstrom -- RBC Capital Markets, LLC -- Analyst\nAnd then not necessarily an M&A question, but Mac's comment about, I mean, less interest in M&A because of where we are in the economic cycle. I'm just curious where you think we are in the economic cycle and are you or may be Dan could comment, seen any kind of stress or rational behavior?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, I think that's irrational behavior. I mean, we're definitely seeing people pick their spots in terms of being quite aggressive, but that really is nothing new. We've seen that for some time. So I think it's pretty much the status quo. In terms of where we are in the cycle, we're several late in the cycle, I think this is the third year that we've said we're late in the cycle. So we continue to plan and look at our portfolio and view new transactions in light of the fact that we have to be prepared at all times for a downturn, whether that happens 18 months from now or three years from now, so it really hasn't changed our posture.\nOperator\nScott Siefers, Sandler O'Neill & Partners.\nScott Siefers -- Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. -- Analyst\nI was hoping you could sort of rewalk through the margin expectations for the fourth quarter. I know Mac, after the second quarter, you guys had been thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of three basis points to six basis points of core margin improvement per quarter in the second half. So I know LIBOR was sort of an issue for you and others this quarter, so may be got off to a slower start kind of bottom end of the range. But if you can rewalk through what the expectations for core and report it would be for the fourth quarter and then the main puts and takes as you'd see them?\nStephen D. Steinour -- Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes, Scott. So we believe that we're going to see expansion in the fourth quarter for them both for core and reported four basis points to six basis points. Part of that is just understanding that we're not going to have the same impacts with LIBOR in the third quarter -- like we did in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. The other part of it is, we continue to remain very disciplined on asset pricing and just making sure that we're getting paid appropriately for the risk that we're taking and we also are anticipating may be a lower deposit beta in the fourth quarter. So those things coming together along with the recent rate increase, we feel confident that the four basis points to six basis points expansion for both the core and reported in the fourth quarter is very doable.\nScott Siefers -- Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. -- Analyst\nAnd then, I just want to make sure -- sorry, this might sound a little like (inaudible) but I just want to make sure I understand the expense guide. So we're starting off that 2017 reported dollars of expenses and now we're taking and I guess it's the 2.5% off of that and then the guidance includes the $40 million of expenses that are sort of unusual. So are we effectively at the middle of that range, implying a fourth quarter expense number of about $670 million, when you net out the year-to-date expenses you've already incurred?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThat probably sounds a little bit high, but the -- again, the fourth quarter is seasonally high from an expense perspective, but that would be the math that you'd want to go through Scott, in order to be able to do that.\nOperator\nJonathan Pancari, Evercore ISI.\nSamuel Ross -- Evercore ISI Institutional Equities -- Analyst\nThis is Sam Ross on for John Pancari. Just a quick question on the auto securitization. I was just wondering if there's any updated plans for the near term in that regard?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. At this point in time, we don't have plans for auto securitization. We've -- the increased pricing that we've been able to execute on the auto book has helped us for volume back and to really maintain revenue where we expected it to be even at the higher origination number with lower rates. So we feel confident in terms of how we're managing the exposure on the balance sheet and don't really see an auto securitization in the future.\nSamuel Ross -- Evercore ISI Institutional Equities -- Analyst\nAnd then, looking at your tax rate, it seems like the tax rates coming in lower than you had previously expected. And I'm just wondering if this is a function of some of the moving parts or onetime items that you have seen? Or is this like a -- the normalized run rate we should expect going forward?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, what you need to adjust for in the third quarter is $3 million benefit related to stock-based comp and a $3 million related to the true-up of tax reform in 2017. If you adjust for that $6 million, you'll be at 15.5% for the third quarter and that is the low end of our range that we had been giving you earlier for second quarter. So we're still in that 15.5% to 16.5% range, it's just these two unusual items this quarter that took us down.\nOperator\nSteven Alexopoulos, JPMorgan.\nSteven Alexopoulos -- JP Morgan Chase & Co -- Analyst\nOn the deposit side, if we look at the sharp growth again in time deposits, where would you guys ultimately like to take those balances to?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, we've -- if you take a look over time, Steve and we've actually run CD balances time deposits off pretty significantly over the years. This really is the first year that we've started to grow that portfolio again. We don't really have a target for it, that the growth has slowed down. Basically, we're not the price leader in the market right now or in the region right now on the CD products, but we're still getting decent growth, I would say on a monthly basis.\nWe just felt that, that was a smart move for us in the first quarter as we saw the loan growth materializing for the year and wanting the state core-fund it without impacting some of the backlogs, say in money market or savings. So we've put the promotion in place and kind of the middle of the first quarter and we've raised probably over $3 billion since then and so we feel really good about the term and the rates that we paid. So it's not going to be -- become a significant portion of our core deposit funding going forward. It's more situational just given the rate environment and what's happening right now.\nSteven Alexopoulos -- JP Morgan Chase & Co -- Analyst\nAnd then, just a follow-up. If we look at deposit costs, it's 14 bps quarter-over-quarter and the time deposits were part of that. How do you think that continues to trend going forward? Is 14 bps a reasonable range or do some pressure come off as may be a slow time deposit growth? Thanks.\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I think some pressure will come off of that, Steven. I think we are seeing time deposit growth slowdown and we're also being cautious with deposit pricing in the fourth quarter, we're thinking of good growth at the rates that we're paying today. So, I do expect the deposit beta in the fourth quarter to be lower than the year-to-date deposit beta. So that's where we stand.\nOperator\nKevin Barker, Piper Jaffrey.\nKevin Barker -- Piper Jaffrey -- Analyst\nLowering the deposit beta in the fourth quarter, I mean, do you expect the deposit beta to run a little bit lower going into the first half of '19 or do you think that's going to reaccelerate just given your guidance for 50% cumulative deposit beta?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, so we still feel comfortable with that 50% cumulative deposit beta. We're at about 50% year-to-date in 2018. And I would tell you that the fourth quarter is probably somewhat situational in terms of where we are and the deposit flows that we see. I would still think about that 50% longer-term deposit beta as being the right -- with right in our model(ph)going forward.\nKevin Barker -- Piper Jaffrey -- Analyst\nOkay. And then, can you talk about the deposit flows that you're seeing on the consumer side versus the commercial side and the betas you're seeing on commercial versus consumer, especially around non-interest bearing deposits?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, so we haven't disclosed betas consumer versus commercial, but we do continue to see good consumer growth, 5% year-over-year growth in core checking account, balances is really strong. And we've also seen good money market growth as well. So very, very comfortable with what's happening on the consumer side of the business and the growth that we're seeing and commercial, as you know is competitive, we evaluate every request that we get for a rate increase and we look at the depth of a relationship and the strength of the opportunity going forward and deciding if we're going to pay out for those deposits. So I think we have a very good process in place that's serving us well and we're managing that side of the balance sheet appropriately.\nOperator\nBrock Vandervliet, UBS.\nBrocker Vandervliet -- UBS Investment Bank -- Analyst\nJust following up on some of these deposit questions, borrowings and non-core deposits have been clearly headed the other way, is the goal to effectively run those out?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, we do like to minimize those balances as best we can and we think about that as being a bit of a feeling around, what we might be willing to pay on commercial deposits and thinking about how we manage that side of the balance sheet. We certainly don't have a plan to minimize other types of funding, but to the extent we can raise good core deposits at the right cost, we're going to continue to do that and we've been actually very successful doing that in 2018. So we feel good about where we're positioned and the deposit flows that we're seeing and wouldn't be surprised if we stay around these levels in terms of overnight funding and those other types of funding sources.\nBrocker Vandervliet -- UBS Investment Bank -- Analyst\nAnd then just stepping back, I mean, the more common pattern across the industry appears to be an acceleration in beta is a more violent mix shift into higher cost deposits and you called that out as actively on the commercial side, but overall your deltas in deposit costs were actually down sequentially. Do you think that's more a factor of your own strategy and tactics or a lack of competitive response or a bit of both ?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI would say, a bit of both. I think the competition in the region has remained very rational. I don't think we see any one relay at any size of organization doing something that looks unreasonable. So that certainly helps. And I do think that we have a bit of a unique customer base because of the Fair Play strategy and what we've done from a satisfaction and loyalty perspective, we have long tenured customers on the consumer side in particular. And I do believe that's certainly going to help us from a pricing and retention perspective going forward. And I think those things really contribute to the fact that we can manage our cost, perhaps a little bit better than the average regional bank.\nOperator\nErik(ph)Najarian, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nBrandon -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThis is Brandon(ph)on behalf of Erica. So two quick questions and the first question, sorry to beat a dead horse, I just want to understand the expenses. So if we plug in the $40 million, are you basically saying that the quarter-over-quarter growth in expenses on a core basis should be around 3%? And then if we back out that $40 million, it kind of gets to the negative 2.5% for the year?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, that -- so, think about it on a full year basis, that's the guidance that we've given, and just make sure you adjust for the $40 million in doing the math.\nBrandon -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nUnderstood. And then separately, I know you guys had previously said that for every 25 basis point increase in rates, you guys should see about $25 million in annual net interest income growth. Is that still intact or do you guys see some pressure on the loan side, that is compressing spreads?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I would say that has reduced a little bit, it's probably around $20 million now.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Terry McEvoy, Stephens.\nTerry McEvoy -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst\nJust the growth in the RV and marine finance portfolio, up $800 million year-over-year. Could you just talk about how much of that is out of footprint and what you're doing internally to manage the risk within that portfolio?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Terry so the growth is, we are now in 34 states, so the growth is going to be disbursed early on, obviously it was majority in footprint, I would say, now we've got greater diversification. The important thing is the profile of the customer, which is identical in all of our markets. You'll note that we're at about an 800 FICO(ph)score in that business. So very low probability of default and we do underwrite this business individually. We're looking at liquidity, we are looking at other measurements that are not auto decisions. Average size of the bulks(ph)in RVs are modest, tend to be second time buyers of these assets. So very consistent origination metrics regardless of geography and frankly we like the geographic diversification.\nTerry McEvoy -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst\nAnd just as a follow up, could you may be discuss reserve building going forward relative to loans, it's been up on to taking up a basis point or two each quarter and just going back to your comments on the credit cycle, do you expect that build to accelerate from here just based on some of those earlier comments.\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe've said that we expect the reserve to build very gradually over time. I think we've been consistent on that going back many quarters. And I think that obviously the components of that builds are then charge-offs, the growth in the portfolio, which has been fairly strong. The market amortization and then we've got portfolio specifics market dynamics, things like that built-in. So I would see a fairly consistent view with (inaudible) builds going forward.\nOperator\nKevin Reevey, D.A. Davidson.\nKevin Reevey -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst\nSo, could you walk us through the thinking as far as how you decide which branches to consolidate?\nStephen D. Steinour -- Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nKevin, there's a lot of work that goes into this and it's coordinated among multiple teams, but it's keyed off of usage patterns within the branches and so, we have a number one branch share in Ohio and Michigan. So we have a density in many of our markets to work from and those utilization patterns are looked at with a view of not just physical but also what's going on at a digital -- an ATM usage. So we have a fair amount of our distribution that's fairly close in to other branches and those patterns help us or guide us in terms of where we see opportunities.\nKevin Reevey -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst\nAnd then earlier in your -- and Steve, earlier in your prepared remarks, you talked about the strength and your bullish outlook on your markets, but I'm just curious just how your ag dependent markets are faring?\nStephen D. Steinour -- Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nSo we're not a -- we're not a -- by any stretch, a meaningful ag lender and while the states of Ohio, Illinois, to some extent Michigan are ag -- they're very diversified ag states. They will have some impact from the tariffs, but there's also a fair amount of relief coming to that sector and the ag sector has had a very robust run for a number of years. Typically, these are individuals or companies that are very, very low leveraged and so, I don't see a significant impact on any of the states we're in, in terms of ag in the near term at this point.\nOperator\nPeter Winter, Wedbush Securities.\nAdel Lee -- Wedbush Securities Inc. -- Analyst\nHi, this is Adel Lee(ph)in for Peter Winter today. I just have a -- hi, I just have a quick question. Could you provide some color around your fee income expectation for the fourth quarter? I mean, given all your continuous tax spend, I would like to see some very exciting things happening there?\nHowell D McCullough -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo, I think you're going to see growth in the areas that we've experienced a growth year-to-date. I think capital markets will continue to have a good year and a good fourth quarter, I think going to continue to see growth in card and payment processing revenue, with the growth in households that we see on the consumer side of the bank, good growth in deposit service charges as well on both consumer and commercial when you think about the treasury management and some of the product opportunities we have there.\nI think weakness will be in mortgage banking as we've seen across the industry and throughout the year, the gain on sale has been lighter this year and that has impacted that line for the entire -- for an entire year. So in general, I think we're in good shape as we think about some of the lines that are performing well for us. Trust and investment management is another just what the -- the way the market has been performing so far this year. So, I would look at the lines where you've seen growth already this year and think about those lines continuing into the fourth quarter.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Steinour for the closing comments.\nStephen D. Steinour -- Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nAgain, thank you all for joining us. Through the first three quarters of 2018, we've consistently produced quality earnings and look to continue the momentum into the end of the year and we're building long-term shareholder value with our top quartile financial performance and strong risk management. We have a track record of disciplined execution and delivering on our goals and commitments as you've seen. So we look forward to providing new long-term financial metrics later this quarter.\nAnd then finally, as always, we'd like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the seventh largest shareholder of Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance.\nSo thanks for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator\nThank you. This concludes today's conference.
