This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, investor relations for Skyworks. Mr.\nHaws, please go ahead.\nMitch Haws -- Investor Relations\nThank you, Laurie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' first fiscal-quarter 2019 conference call. With me today are Liam Griffin, our president and chief executive officer; and Kris Sennesael, our chief financial officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking.\nPlease refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for more information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance that we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures, consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.\n\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. Despite macro weakness across our global mobile business, Skyworks delivered solid financial results, driven by content gains, our expanding footprint in broad markets, the continued execution of our innovative product strategy and the strength of our business model. Specifically in Q1, we generated $972 million of revenue, delivered gross margin of 51% and operating margin of 36.7%. We posted an EPS of $1.83, and we produced $549 million in cash flow from operations, a new quarterly record for Skyworks.\nIn addition to achieving strong profitability and robust cash flow, we've clearly expanded our design win pipeline in several emerging high-growth categories. Our solutions are now enabling the newest WiFi standards, along with the latest advances in MIMO base stations and across mobile payment platforms. For example, our WiFi 6 products are now powering NetGear routers, Charter Communications home gateways and Ruckus indoor access point, to name just a few. We also partnered with Square, a market-leading mobile payment platform, powering their latest long-range retail systems.\nAnd we supported next-generation, high-fidelity audio solutions for Bose, enabled by Alexa voice controls. In addition, we ramped advanced wireless engine supporting Phillips end-to-end streetlight management platforms. And across the infrastructure space, we secured a number of Massive MIMO wins with leading base station providers as they prepare for the ramp to 5G. Across automotive, we supported next-generation telematics solutions for leading German and Korean manufacturers.\nAnd these results highlight our success as we continue to increase our product reach across a growing set of end markets, applications and customers. We have extended our technology leadership in cellular and are capitalizing more broadly across the Internet of Things, leveraging a diverse set of connectivity protocols, including WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and GPS. Looking ahead, 5G technology will fuel a broad array of markets and applications ranging from industrial IoT, automotive, machine-to-machine, healthcare, smart cities as well as artificial intelligence. Capitalizing on the advances of our mobile solutions, the launch of strategic product categories and the diversified strength of broad markets, we remain confident in our ability to outperform.\nAs a management team, we are squarely focused on operational excellence while continuing to invest strategically across innovative technologies and products, establishing a firm foundation for future growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q2.\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Liam. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2019 was $972 million. Momentum in our high-growth broad markets business allowed us to partially offset unit declines across our mobile business that was mostly driven by weak end customer demand in China. In fact, revenue from broad markets continue to outperform in the first fiscal quarter with double-digit revenue growth compared to the first quarter of last year, demonstrating continued diversification across multiple end markets, customers and applications.\nGross profit was $495 million, resulting in a gross margin of 51%, down 20 basis points sequentially on lower revenue. Operating expenses were $139 million or 14% of revenue, slightly below our guidance. We generated $356 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 36.7%. First-quarter effective tax rate was 9.7%.\nThis drove net income of $325 million or $1.83 of diluted earnings per share. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was a record $549 million. And capital expenditures were $129 million, resulting in a strong free cash flow margin.\nWe paid $67 million in dividends and repurchased a record high of 4 million shares of our common stock for a total of $284 million. And we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.1 billion and no debt. As noted in our separate press release issued today, Skyworks' board of directors has authorized a new $2 billion stock repurchase program. This new buyback plan reflects our confidence in Skyworks' business model and our ability to consistently produce strong free cash flow, allowing us to leverage share repurchases and dividends to generate higher shareholder returns.\nOur strong balance sheet and cash position provide important competitive advantages, allowing us to make the strategic investments in R&D, while funding the capital requirements for 5G as the complexity of our solutions intensifies. Now let's review our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We anticipate revenue in the range of $800 million to $820 million. We expect gross margin to be between 50.5% and 51%, which is flat year-over-year at the midpoint of the range, despite lower year-over-year revenue.\nIn light of the market backdrop, we will continue to drive operational efficiencies and prudently manage our operating expenses down to approximately $135 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $3 million in other income and an effective tax rate of 10%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 175.5 million shares. Assuming a revenue midpoint of approximately $810 million, we plan to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.43.\nWith that, let me turn the call back to Liam.\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Kris. As our results indicate, we are continuing to deliver high levels of profitability with consistently strong cash flow. More importantly, we have strategically positioned Skyworks to outperform as we seize upon a complex set of new opportunities in both mobile and broad markets. For example, the shift to 5G is a tremendous catalyst, representing an entirely new connected ecosystem, one where Skyworks will play a leadership role.\nAt a higher level, 5G will be transformational, requiring step function increases in analog performance, advanced filtering and power efficiency. With decades of experience spanning successive technology generations, Skyworks is well-positioned to capitalize, with strategic partnerships across all smartphone and IoT customers, differentiated system solutions, enabling unmatched levels of integration and performance, focused investments to expand our product portfolio, IP and scale, and finally, a business model that leverages both mobile and broad market diversification with leading financial performance. We are committed to creating shareholder value, while executing on our ambitious vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time. That concludes our prepared remarks.\nOperator, let's open the line for questions.Â \n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nChina Tariffs and Huawei Restrictions Mean Tough Going for Skyworks Solutions\n\n\nWhy Skyworks Solutions Fell 24% in May\n\n\n2 Top 5G Stocks That Pay a Dividend\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our first question, from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nCraig Ellis -- B Riley FBR -- Analyst\nYes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the record free cash flow on the quarter. Guys, I want to start just by understanding the different dynamics in the business as we look at the second quarter. Kris, can you just clarify for us, what was the split between broad markets and integrated mobile in the first quarter? And then, as we look at the second quarter, what are the gives and takes in the second quarter, Liam? Do you think that can be a trough for the year in integrated mobile? Or would that come later in the fiscal year?\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Craig. I'll start by giving you some of the details there. So in the December quarter, broad market was approximately 27% of total revenue. And of course, mobile was 73%.\nSo in terms of broad market, we are still running at over $1 billion on an annualized revenue run rate. Also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, broad market was up double digits on a year-over-year basis in the December quarter. So we continue to see a lot of strength in that business, in our infrastructure business, some of our wireless connectivity solutions, and as well, we start turning revenue in our automotive business as well.\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nRight, Craig. And also, if you think about the back half of the year pivoting off Q2, which is seasonally down and certainly hit with some macro effects, we feel much better about where the second half is going, consummating strategic design wins, which we'll be launching in the back half of 2019.\nCraig Ellis -- B Riley FBR -- Analyst\nAnd then, the follow-up question is on the new share buyback announcement. So I believe it was a year ago that the program stepped up significantly to $1 billion, I think, around 88% of that was executed within one year. So the question is this, one, should we look at the new program as something that could be executed with similar pacing to last year's program? And if not, then should we think about other uses of cash, whether it be further M&A beyond Avnera, or potential action with the dividend as things that the company would try and prosecute? Thanks very much guys.\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo first of all, we continue to generate very strong cash flow, very strong cash from operations. And even when you look at the free cash flow, taking into account our CAPEX, we continue to generate a very strong free cash flow. Obviously, in the December quarter, the free cash flow margin was approximately 43%. We benefited there from a reduction in our DSOs.\nBut on an ongoing basis, we expect and we're well on track for the 30% free cash flow margin. So we feel good about that part of the business. And yes, in January of 2018, we put a $1 billion buyback program in place. There was only $129 million left under that previous program, so that got canceled.\nAnd we did put a new $2 billion program in place right now. If you look at cash return to the shareholders, in fiscal '18, we actually returned over 120% of our free cash flow back to the shareholders, a combination of our dividend program as well as our share buyback program. And we will continue to use those two programs to return substantial amount of the free cash flow back to the shareholder.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question, from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nYes, thanks very much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about 5G, both on the infrastructure side as well as the mobile side going forward. Can you remind us how meaningful your infrastructure business is within broad markets? And what kind of trends you're seeing there as it relates to 5G? And then, on the mobile side, I believe it's more of a 2020 dynamic, but what are your thoughts on that as a potential driver for both units as well as content for your business?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Well, we have been a consistent provider of infrastructure technology for years across a global set of customers in Europe, in Americas and in Asia. So that's something that hasn't changed. We are starting to see some ramp-up in architectures in 5G on the base station side.\nThere's new technologies, there's MIMO integration there as well. So that is definitely a driver and a catalyst for broad market. And then, in parallel with that, we are absolutely committed to delivering 5G technology. We're working on that right now with customers that matter.\nA lot of collaborative strategic dialogue between our customers and ourselves to craft the best possible solutions for 5G. It brings with it tremendous opportunities in filtering, tremendous opportunities in gallium arsenide technology, our ability to integrate basically these products in our own sites. And we launched, as you know, our Sky5 platform here last year. So we're making great strides.\nWe think those products will come to market probably in 2020, and more readily in 2021, but great opportunity. And as we noted in the prepared remarks, a real catalyst for this industry and we'll be at the forefront.\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat. And as a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask about China smartphones. What percentage of their revenue came from your Chinese customers within mobile in the December quarter? And I guess, going forward, did you think the current quarter is the trough for that business? Or do you think we should prepare for multiple quarters of weakness, just given the inventory situation there?\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo in the December quarter, revenue from our Chinese customers was approximately 20% of our total revenue. It was down substantially on a sequential basis, which is somewhat in line with normal seasonality. However, we do expect, in the March quarter, a further minor sequential decline of that business.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the execution. Maybe just following up on the last question.\nIf you look, obviously, there's a lot of well-known weakness in mobile, but it equates to some down -- substantial down year-over-year. So I'm just kind of curious, as you look back at December, and then maybe even that whole fiscal year, in terms of your -- the market versus your share in your content, if you can kind of look back there and have analyzed what drove those substantial year-over-year declines and then kind of any perspectives as you look forward at that reversing?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Blayne. This is Liam here. So the way I would look at this is you've got a regional effect with China specifically, where the China demand really softened. And so think of that as a geography, that it certainly impacted customers in China.\nIt also had a bit of a headwind on the export market where a lot of the China brands would populate technology from companies like Skyworks and then those products would go all over the world in emerging markets and they're hard to track but we knew there was revenue there. So you have the China consumption coming down. You have export markets also coming down. And then, we had specific unique challenges with Tier 1 customers that had much more advanced richer content with a lot of value with and technology, and their units coming down, some of that was China and some of that was other markets, but it was a culmination of that effect.\nChina, at a high level, and then you could port that into individual customers of Skyworks and kind of readthrough the -- even Samsung had some challenges here in the last quarter. So that's what we've endured. If you look out in time, I feel a lot better about where we're positioned. We're executing on the things that we can control.\nWe're delivering great content, high-performance technologies that our customers love. We're readying for 5G. And then, in parallel, we've got a broad markets business that continues to grow double digits. So we feel better about the second half.\nThis was a tricky period here that we've navigated through, but we expect to show better results here as we get into the second half.\nBlayne Curtis -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nAnd then, I just wanted to go back to the broad market. It seems like, in the press release, you mentioned some momentum into March, just kind of going back to the first question. Is December the trough in broad markets? And do you expect it to increase sequentially?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, it should be. I mean, we should continue to see some increases sequentially here. It tends to run on its -- on an uncorrelated vector, right, vis-Ã -vis mobile. And we continue to be upside surprised by some of the new design wins that we bring forth.\nAnd one of the nice things I will say is where mobile is fairly well-characterized in terms of customers and TAM and value, the broad markets business, there's nothing but headroom there. So even in a market that could move sideways to down, we could grow. And we're doing that. And one of the things to remember is that the breadth of our wireless protocols, whether it's WiFi or Bluetooth or ZigBee or cellular, really offers a great opportunity for us as we look at increasingly diverse set of customers and providing a menu of options for those customers as they move to connected solutions.\nOperator\nAnd our next question, from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.\nJamison Crone -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHi, this is Jamison calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for the question. First, I was wondering if you guys could give us a bit of an idea of when you expect your BAW revenue to become more meaningful? And how does this translate into margins? I guess, specifically, do you expect this to be a tailwind toward your 53%, this margin target?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Well, as we noted in the last earnings call, we've been making very good progress in our bulk acoustic wave portfolio. And as you know, we've been a market leader in temperature compensated SAW. We continue to invest in that category, and that's become and continues to become a real strategic weapon for us.\nAnd the bulk acoustic wave technology is moving along very well. We have design wins, we expect revenue in the second half. I don't want to quantify too much of that right now, but we've made the kind of progress that we expected to make. We've made more investments in capital as well to fortify the scale of our BAW technology.\nAnd it's just another great opportunity for us to expand TAM and create the most diverse set of solutions that we can provide our customers. Very meaningful for us in 5G as well as move into that category.\nJamison Crone -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. And my follow-up is, I guess, turning toward broad markets, I think you point to a bit of a macro slowdown, I guess, across your whole markets. But looking at broad markets specifically, why are we not seeing, I guess, a slowdown there beyond infrastructure and IoT? What areas, I guess, are you seeing, I guess, a slowing?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nRight. Yes, so broad markets has provided an upside here and will continue to do so. Again, as I mentioned, there's just so much opportunity that we haven't yet covered. We're doing great work with our WiFi product lines, with our ZigBee product lines, getting into the infrastructure space now, that's taken off again for us.\nA lot of connected devices in the home, security, working with customers like Amazon, like Nest. We even have some defense business in our broad market portfolio. So it creates a great opportunity because we're really not constrained by TAM in certain markets, we're growing in the TAM, we're expanding our reach and we're getting into new customers and accounts. So there's a lot of headwind for growth, even if some of the market dynamics, at a macro level, are not in our favor.\nOperator\nOur next question, from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig, your line is open.\nVinayak Rao -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThis is Vinayak calling in for Craig. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to discuss like the opportunities do you see for content increase at your marquee customers when you look at appeal to in front of you? Like what are the key products that drive content increase to you and what kind of boost would 5G provide?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Well, if you look at the opportunities today, there's still an incredible ecosystem that lives and breathes on connected devices and smartphones, and the higher-end players really embrace that. And if you look at what we have been seeing is we have been seeing an increasing opportunity in mobile devices, even in 4G, we've been seeing that. Much more complex solutions.\nOur DRx category, for example, our high-band solutions now bringing BAW to the table, all of that is moving in the right direction. But the big inflection is going to be the step up into 5G, and that will absolutely happen. And when that happens, it's necessary that new technologies are brought into that same physical form factor, that same handset, new technologies, new spectrum, new frequencies, more filtering, the ability to coexist with different devices brings in a tremendous amount of complexity and challenge and creates a unique opportunity for Skyworks and the to-tier players in our space to win. So we're looking forward to that.\nAnd again, there's a parallel opportunity in the infrastructure side, but we're absolutely seeing the block diagrams, the expectations and the dialogue with our customers that point to tremendous opportunity when 5G arrives.\nVinayak Rao -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. That's very helpful. And for my follow-up, just on Avnera, like could you just provide us an update how the integration is going? Where do you see the key opportunities? And any milestones that we should be looking forward as we measure your progress on that acquisition?\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nRight. So Avnera in the December quarter came in fully in line with our expectations. By now, we have fully integrated that business into our broad markets. And so we're really pleased with the Avnera there.\nIt came with a very strong management team, some great IP and technology. And we see a lot of good progress there as we integrate that into our business.\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nRight. And if you think about the strategic rationale with Avnera, it's increasingly clear that voice is becoming one of the most important interfaces now in devices, whether it's connected devices, whether it's automotive, voice technology is very critical and it's going through a phase now of upgrades with more IP being layered in. So that technology for us, by virtue of the Avnera deal, puts us in a great position to capitalize, levering their unique solutions and then allowing Skyworks with a greater scale skill and manufacturing and also a greater reach from a customer perspective to weave that all together to develop new sets of opportunities and new sets of revenue curves as we look out.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question, from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\nThank you very much. I guess, my first question is how to think about the shape of the year as you go through the end of the fiscal year? I think June is usually flat to up maybe a little bit, and September is usually up about 10%. So are there any sort of weird things that you'd point to with the comps this year that would make this year sort of abnormal versus what is typical seasonally?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. It's a great question. As we look out, what you just modeled is kind of what we see as well. You typically have March quarter that's seasonally down.\nObviously, more pronounced this year across this space. And if you look at the June quarter, that's flattish, maybe up a little bit. And then, we get into the second half of the calendar year, our Q4, and then Q1 calendar, calendar and fiscal, we would expect higher levels of growth. So what we do know is that we are doing the work that's necessary to win in platforms that matter, and not just mobile platforms but also in broad markets and also in infrastructure.\nAnd the design win execution has been very favorable for us. It doesn't show up in the March quarter numbers. So we feel good about that. The breadth of the technology for us is really opening up and it's nott one or two accounts, we're moving the dial with some of our unique solutions across normal players in mobile, and then the broad market is really just about adding new applications and customers.\nSo we expect -- again, we're not guiding the full year, but we do expect, knowing what we know about our business and what we deliver on content, and a lot of cases, hasn't even shipped yet, we feel very good about that signature where you kind of have a flat to slightly up Q3, and then we move into a second half with a stronger top line and the financial performance and the bottom line should follow.\nTimothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\nAwesome. And then, I guess, last -- the first half of the last fiscal year, you gave a little bit of granularity in terms of your largest customer there, a portion of your revenue, can you give us a sense in terms of what that was in December, and maybe what you think it will be in March?\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So in the December quarter, our largest customer was over 50% of our total revenue, pretty much in line with what it was in the December quarter a year ago. Keep in mind that the December quarter is a very strong quarter for our large customer. When you look at it on a full-year basis, we expect that large customer to be in the mid-40s as a percent of total revenue, again, pretty much in line with what it was last year.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question, from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nShawn Harrison -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nHi, afternoon. Just wanted to follow up on the commentary of increased investments for BAW. Does that change in any way the CAPEX outlook for the year, which I think was around $400 million?\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo, not really. I mean, we expect our CAPEX to run slightly above 10% to revenue. It's a combination of some capacity expansion, CAPEX that really especially in our filter operation as we continue with our in-sourcing process that we talked about in the past. But in addition to that, we are making the necessary technology-related CAPEX investments in our filter operation and in our back-end operation.\nAnd especially in the filter operation, a substantial part there is in support of our ramp with BAW filters.\nShawn Harrison -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nOK. As a follow up, the OPEX guide of $135 million, you're only up about $3 million year-over-year despite Avnera. How much of kind of the OPEX you're taking out is temporary versus any permanent changes in that number?\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, as a management team, we will manage our operating expenses. We know what we can control. We will look at discretionary spending. Obviously, there is some variable operating expenses as well that's come down on lower revenue.\nAnd so, at the same time, we will not hesitate to make the necessary investments for our future and make the necessary investments to build those new technology building blocks that support 5G, all the good R&D activities to support further expansion of our broad market business. So it's a combination of both. Again, we will continue to very prudently manage our operating expenses and adjust if and when necessary.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBill Peterson -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHi, thanks for taking the question and good job controlling what you can contorl. I wanted to ask a question similar to the revenue trajectory for the year. I guess, how should we think about gross margins given -- it sounds like you have a pretty good filter content later in the year for products that aren't released yet. How should we think about the gross margin expansion through the year?\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo first, maybe a couple of numbers there, right? So December came in at 51%, down 20 basis points on lower revenue. We guide March at 50.5% to 51%, which is sequentially down but in line with normal seasonality. And so approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. Looking forward to the remainder of the year and beyond that, I feel good about our ability to further expand the gross margin toward our target model of 53%.\nObviously, if we have more revenue tailwinds, that will help us to get faster to the 53%. But we are, again, focusing on operational efficiencies. We are driving the technology curve, we are introducing new products to the market that are more value-add type of products, and a combination of all of that will help us to further improve the gross margin.\nBill Peterson -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. And I guess, I think, in the past, broad markets you described as margin accretive, and presumably, that can grow faster than mobile. I guess, do you think you can still, as you look at your design win pipeline, do you think that business can continue growing at a double-digit clip for the full fiscal year?\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So it's -- broad market is above average gross margin, and we do believe that we can continue to grow that business double digit.\nOperator\nAnd our next question, from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nThank you. Liam, so if I look at the December quarter revenue and also the March quarter outlook, they're down almost double digits year-on-year, even though your content is up. And then, broad markets is growing nicely in a double-digit pace. So my question is to what extent do you think your March quarter outlook actually reflects the end demand? I mean, we know that, obviously, end demand has been weak, but I'm just wondering if there's inventory at the component level that you need to work through? And then, the March quarter outlook is probably not a true reflection of what the end demand is.\nSo if you could shed any light on that, that will be helpful.\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Yes, I mean, obviously, the way the quarter rolled out for us is not what we expected, not what we anticipated. And I think that sentiment is shared by a number of peers, not just in mobile but anyone in semis, and even in tech kind of absorbed this SAW reduction, this change. And again, it's not even specific to a customer.\nI think we had, as I mentioned, a China effect that really hurt us and then some other trickle down challenges. But having said all that, where we are here off of our current guidance and into the March quarter, we feel it's the right balance guidance, it's balanced and positions ourselves well for recovery in the second half. We're always keenly analyzing where the inventory is and what our customers have on hand if we can see that, and we usually can. And one of the reasons why our number was down in Q2, quite frankly, is to reconcile that.\nSo we feel that we created a balanced view here from our guide and are positioned to move forward and up from here.\nSrini Pajjuri -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nGot it. And then, you talked about 5G. Obviously, that's probably a bigger driver next year, but it looks like several of your customers are going to announce 5G phones in the not-too-distant future. I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in terms of design win traction? And then, also, if you can comment on, when you talk about content expansion, what exactly will drive content expansion? Is it simply you need more powerful PAs and filters, or is it in a more band? So if you could shed some light on that, that will be helpful.\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, absolutely. So a couple of things, yes, you will see announcements for 5G in the next 12 months, there's no question about that. And we are absolutely going to be populating those phones when they're announced. I think the big shift to the 5G ecosystem will probably be a little bit later, kind of end of 2020, into 2021, but there'll be steps along that path.\nNow if we look at the opportunity, if you could just envision what we're looking at here is you've got a 4G technology engine that is in place already in your device, and that is not going away. 5G is going to be incremental and additive to your current handset. So no one is walking around today with 5G frequencies in their phone or dealing with 6 gigahertz and above or dealing with millimeter wave in their phone, they're not doing that yet. That is coming.\nSo it's going to offer increased opportunity for companies like Skyworks. It's also going to drive a great deal of architectural complexity. And those that know how to handle that and companies that have the ability to be configurable and flexible in the architecture because what we are seeing in 5G is every customer wants it differently, whether it's a geographical roaming issue, it's a size issue, they're different. These are not cookie-cutter devices, and that's great for us because it gives us an opportunity to shape the curve, work with the customers, provide the greatest technology and also be in early.\nSo we're looking forward to it. We're making the investments. We've round out our filter portfolio now with BAW. We've done a tremendous job today with our Sky5 platform on both transmit chain and receive side with the DRx technology.\nWe're even weaving in some of our devices in WiFi 6 and GPS in some of these applications. So we're really looking forward to this. And this -- again, this is forward-looking revenue that we'll be seeing late into this year and further into the 2020, 2021 time frame.\nOperator\nWe'll go to Tristan Gerra with Baird. Please go ahead.\nTristan Gerra -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nHi, good afternoon. Elaborating on the previous 5G infrastructure question, would you be able to say whether you have content currently into the Asia geographies that are currently ramping, and I can think of China specifically in the second half of this year. Just trying to see how impactful that ramp could be on your revenue line as you exit kind of in 2019? And also, if you could give us a bit of color on how your market share looks like in 5G base station versus what you've had so far in 4G?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Well, we expect to, and we are positioned, to support all of the global infrastructure players in 5G, the U.S. players, the European players and the players in Asia. And all of them today are customers for us.\nAnd the advances that we see in the MIMO architectures and the specific spectrum that's required to deliver the 5G waveforms, there's some great challenges there that we're going to work with these supplies and these infrastructure players to overcome. So we have a balance to do. We've seen a lot of great work come out of Ericsson and Nokia-Siemens networks. There's obviously some players that we see in APAC.\nAnd we're well-positioned across the space. We need that. The infrastructure has to be in place for this new network to perform. So we have great technology and opportunity in the handheld devices but we also have to pair that up with the infrastructure side, so we get that signal working together.\nAnd we're all over it in each one of those customers.\nTristan Gerra -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nOK. And then, given that before we see a more meaningful 5G upturns in the U.S. in 2020, RF content increases in the U.S. this year are probably somewhat muted.\nSo are we -- should we be bullish on -- in terms of RF content increases specific to the China market, which is probably where there's going to be more 5G production this year? How should we look at the year-over-year potential comps in your mobile business for this whole year?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So there's a lot there. But what I would say is it's possible that China may be early in 5G, that's possible. But I think you also got to look at the global theater here because, I think, you've got some tremendous technologies coming to market across the globe in Korea, from the U.S., Europe as well as China.\nSo I think it's going to be more balanced, in my perspective and what I'm seeing in my dialogue with customers, it's going to be a more balanced launch. And as I also mentioned, you're going to have different flavors. Technologies that are going to be -- some of these are just absolutely necessary, there's new frequencies and new spectrum that -- and products that go into these phones have to be able to deliver and manage and deliver signals across that spectrum. And we'll be one of those players.\nThere will be some other things that will be required as well. Just think about the coexistence of all of this technology in a single device is going to create lots of challenges, harmonics challenges, coexistence challenges that have to be overcome. We're working with our customers to do that. And there will be players in China, but I think it's going to be much more of a global impact.\nAnd also remember, 5G is truly a technology. It's a technology that brings incredible data rate, low latency and capacity. So 5G is not just a catalyst for the mobile phone, it's going to create IoT opportunities, it's going to create small cell opportunities and enable markets that we haven't even seen before as we move into the future, automotive as well. So there's a lot to look forward there and we're in good position working with market leaders globally.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question, from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nVijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities USA LLC -- Analyst\nhi, guys. Good work on the quarter. Just wondering on the BAW side, what is your roadmap there? And what do you see as mix of BAW in the quarter as you exit 2019?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Well, what I will say is that we've been working on our BAW products for quite a while. We haven't said much about it until the last earnings call, but we're making great advancements, great strides, sampling customers that matter, getting incredible feedback, delivering on the successes that we have and then also learning about new opportunities that we haven't yet addressed. So it certainly rounds out our portfolio.\nThere's a lot of players in that space as well but we're going to be a meaningful element in BAW. As we go forward, as Kris mentioned, we made strategic investments in this technology. So this isn't just IP, this is also being able to deliver the kind of technology and scale on the production side that makes this happen. And the BAW process is very different than surface acoustic wave.\nIt requires a whole different type of manufacturing complexity. And we know how to get that done now with a lot of help. So you should just continue to see a steady growth in that area as we move forward. Our TC SAW technology is also vital for these architectures.\nWe're seeing a lot of growth there as well and we continue to work that. But one of the things that we do differently than some of our peers is the integration. It's bringing in the right filter, the right ICs, the right mix of gallium arsenide and SOI technology, the packaging and the configurability that we can offer each customer, I think, makes it unique. Having BAW now within our portfolio ready just solves another issue, and we're looking forward to delivering on that as time goes on.\nVijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities USA LLC -- Analyst\nGot it. And then, the inventory side, I know it's tough to get a handle on all the inventories, but your inventory went up, looks like, in the December quarter. But as you're going to March, with the radios coming down, do you expect inventories in-house to go up again or do you see it coming down? And also, on the channel inventory side, any thoughts on how channel inventories look in China, etc.? What's your best guess there?\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo on the inventory on our own books in the December quarter was flat, slightly up $3 million versus the September quarter. And when you look at inventory going forward, of course, you have to take into account our seasonal pattern, where fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q3 are the lowest quarters. And then, we see strong sequential growth into fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1. We obviously want to maximize our capital equipment efficiency and trying to minimize our CAPEX.\nSo as a result of that, we will level out our operational activity into our factories. And so during the low seasonal quarters, we typically build some internal inventory. And so you will see inventories go up in fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q3, and then we start bleeding that off in Q4 and Q1, that's our own inventory level. On the inventory -- in the distribution channel, I think Liam already talked about that.\nWe've definitely have seen some cautious behavior from most of our distributors, given the level of volatility and some of the macro headwinds out there. And so we are not fighting the tape there, we are working with our distribution partners and we keep a very healthy, normal level of inventory into the channel.\nOperator\nThank you. And our last question is from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nRajvindra Gill -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nYes, thanks for taking my questions. With respect to the gross margin question. So in terms of margins kind of stabilizing and potentially expanding as you increase your mix of broad markets, I was wondering about any particular pricing pressure you're seeing in your mobile business that could potentially offset that mix shift, that positive mix shift going forward?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Yes, so certainly, the broad market portfolio has accretive margins to the company, but what I will say is as we move into enhanced 5G, the mobile business is going to get much more complex, and differentiation and execution and scale are going to matter. And we think we're going to do very well in that environment and provide a tremendous amount of value to our customer, but also get the kind of margin that we deserve for bringing that technology to market. So we feel good about our outlook and gross margin as we move to 5G and beyond.\nRajvindra Gill -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nAnd for my follow-up, with respect to the broad markets, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of what percentage of that revenue is coming from ADAS and autonomous driving? And what's your position there? What areas of growth? What specific products do you think you'll have outsized share gains, whether that's in WiFi, Bluetooth or the sub-6 gigahertz band or MIMOs? Wondering how you think about the 5G system architecture for the connected car?\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. That's a great question. We are, fortunately, today, before 5G has arrived, we've had a really strong, I would say, the last 1.5 years, a real strong uptake in automotive and engagement with a number of leading players. Some we can announce and some we just can't announce.\nAnd it started with some of the instrument clusters that work and infotainment work. And now, we're doing a lot of the telematics work. So -- and it's a meaningful part of our broad market revenue. We don't segment auto as a specific product line but it's a meaningful piece and one of the fastest-growing.\nWhen you move to 5G, and we're working with the players now, the connectivity element is vital. It is critical. Again, you need the data rates 100x what we see in 4G. Latency is absolutely at a premium, near zero latency is required.\nAnd in many cases, redundant cellular engines are required to ensure reliability and performance. And each player has a different way of looking at this, but it's going to be a significant opportunity for connectivity and wireless connectivity. And then, from that, I think we can move further along within the automobile, collision avoidance and even some vision systems and things like that down the road. Some of that we don't have in the portfolio today, but we absolutely will be well-positioned on the core connectivity element, which are vital in 5G autonomous vehicle.\nSo that's an exciting opportunity. I'm happy that the team has been able to execute today on 4G opportunities and some other in-dash automobile solutions, but 5G for automotive is going to be really special.\nOperator\nAnd I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.\nLiam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you all for participating on today's call.
