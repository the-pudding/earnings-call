My name is Amanda and I will be your coordinator today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg you may begin.\nSuzanne Osberg -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website Q3 2018 supplemental information, that summarizes our quarterly results and trends.\nAs detailed on Slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Please note that all financial and operating results discussed today are for third quarter 2018. Any comparisons are versus the prior year quarter, unless otherwise noted, and all margin references are based on revenues. Adjusted results exclude acquisition-related net expenses. The impact of selling acquired inventory after its mark-up to fair value in accordance with acquisition accounting and a restructuring charge.\nFurthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q3 2018 supplemental information and SEC filings. We will begin today's earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance, as well as market trends heading into 2019. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results, a question-and-answer session will follow.\nI will now turn the call over to Ward.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you Suzanne and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta continues to benefit from an improving construction cycle and the strength of our operational performance. We achieved record third quarter revenues, gross profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA and diluted earnings per share. And we delivered these impressive results while successfully managing near-term challenges from historically high levels of precipitation.\nWe estimate weather negatively impacted third quarter profitability by $40 million to $45 million. Importantly as noted in today's earnings release, we remain on course to once again deliver record revenues and EBITDA for the full year and are well positioned for continued growth in 2019.\nWe're confident that the construction cycle is not nearing its peak in Martin Marietta-served markets and a wide range of factors support steady and sustainable construction growth and favorable pricing in the near to medium term. Specifically for the third quarter, in July and August we experienced more manageable weather patterns, consistent with our internal expectations, aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete shipments, meaningfully accelerated and pricing also improved. These trends highlight the attractive demand environment across our geographic footprint, particularly in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa and are wholly consistent with our broader expectations.\nIn September we experienced extraordinary weather, including Hurricane Florence and record Texas rainfall, halting the third quarter's earlier momentum which is typically our industry's busiest and most profitable period. These notable disruptions impacted more than half of our Building Materials business as measured by revenues.\nRegardless of underlying market strength from mother nature can temporarily interrupt construction activity. Hurricane Florence made landfall in Eastern North Carolina not far from the South Carolina border. This event affected at least 15 of September's 19 selling days, as the region was either preparing for and during and/or cleaning up from the storm. Indeed this unusually slow-moving storm produced torrential rainfall and widespread flooding throughout the Carolinas, leaving an estimated $17 billion of damage and over 18 trillion gallons of water in its wake. That's enough water to fill the Chesapeake Bay and 10 billion gallons of it filled our Castle Hayne and Belgrade quarries in Eastern North Carolina.\nWhile Texas was not affected by Hurricane Florence, the state experienced its wettest September in the last 124 years. Dallas-Fort Worth had nearly 13 inches of rain during the month, while San Antonio received nearly 17 inches of rain, almost 14 inches above normal. Texas is our largest state by revenues, with aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete operations throughout the Texas Triangle. The negative financial impact of September's record rainfall was considerably more significant than both Hurricane Florence and last year's Hurricane Harvey combined.\nMost importantly we're grateful that our employees and their families are safe in the aftermath of September severe weather. Our thoughts, prayers and relief efforts are geared toward those affected, as they rebuild their lives and communities. As a company, we manage what we can control. We've initiated pumping activities that flooded North Carolina quarries and systematically resumed sales at the vast majority of our affected locations. Since North Carolina is our third largest state by revenues and our leading state by unit profitability, Mid-America Group shipments, pricing, production and margins have been disproportionately negatively affected in the near term. However we view the situation for precisely what it is, temporary.\nAs we've seen historically, emergency repairs to houses, businesses and transportation networks are critical in the early days and weeks following natural disasters. Reconstruction efforts typically require years of steady building activity with increased demand in heavy side building materials. Importantly we remain appropriately focused on our tactical day-to-day decisions and mindful of the long-term aspects of our business.\nWe know the dynamics of our industry. The various needs and abilities of our communities, customers and suppliers and how these forces coalesce. That's why Martin Marietta's core has been fashioned around macroeconomics, reflecting the powerful demographic and related trends that we see as so critical to overall success in our space. Accordingly, our leading market positions, discipline pricing strategy and execution of our strategic plan, position Martin Marietta for further growth and shareholder value creation, as the ongoing construction cycle continues for the foreseeable future.\nTo be clear, in our view the construction cycle is not nearing its peak in Martin Marietta served markets. In fact many of our most attractive areas while growing are still well below mid-cycle shipment levels. Further it remains difficult to see an end to this recovery when the long awaited arrival of increased infrastructure activity has only recently begun in earnest. Throughout our geographic footprint, we see no signs of either a slowdown or markets that are overbuilt.\nTo the contrary, employment and population trends together with the solid fiscal health of our key states, support steady and sustainable construction growth in the near to medium term. Our optimism is further bolstered by favorable pricing trends, typically an indicator of underlying market strength.\nNow let's review the third quarter operating results in more detail. Heritage aggregate shipments adjusted for third quarter 2017 volumes from the Forsyth County, Georgia quarry we divested in April 2018 grew 4%. We estimate heritage volume growth would have been closer to 12%, absent the noted weather headwinds. Public construction activity is typically the most weather-sensitive sector, due to strict Department of Transportation specifications and performance standards.\nAccordingly, heritage aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market were flat, as large public projects under way in North Carolina and Texas were delayed. Importantly, we're encouraged by the recent acceleration in public lettings and contract awards, most notably in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida and by improving rail service. The percentage of our heritage aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market remains below the company's most recent five-year average of 43%.\nAs state DOTs and contractors continue to address labor constraints and the broader industry benefits from further regulatory reform, infrastructure construction activity should continue to be bolstered from the funding provided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act. Additionally state and local initiatives such as the infrastructure funding proposals included on Colorado's ballot today, show a growing grassroots effort to relieve traffic congestion and improve commute times.\nState and local initiatives have historically garnered strong vote or approval, and we believe they will play an expanded role in public sector activity. Heritage aggregate shipments to the nonresidential market increased 5% in the third quarter, driven primarily by data and distribution centers as well as wind farms. Consistent with third-party forecasts, nonresidential construction activity should continue to increase in both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors for the next several years in key Martin Marietta markets.\nAdditional federal regulatory approvals supported by higher oil prices should notably contribute to increased aggregates consumption from the next wave of energy sector projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast. Construction activity for these projects is expected to begin in earnest in 2019 and beyond. The nonresidential market represented 33% of third quarter heritage aggregate shipments. Heritage aggregate shipments to the residential market increased 7%.\nTexas, Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia and South Carolina consistently ranked in the Top 10 states nationally for growth in single-family housing units starts, inclusive of Iowa, Maryland and Indiana. Growth in single-family housing unit permits for our top nine states, is outpacing the national average. Looking ahead, regional residential construction growth should continue as supported by employment and population gains in our key markets. And while mortgage rate increases may temporarily dampen the growth of housing starts, once stabilized, the residential market will adapt and continue to strengthen.\nOur view in this respect is not based upon blind optimism and hope it's fact-based. Specifically, housing starts have yet to return to historical levels, despite notable population gains. We see the home building industry is just beginning to address the shortage of single-family housing units that exists, particularly for entry-level homes. Our leading positions in southeastern and southwestern states offer superior opportunities to benefit from this expected growth. Furthermore, continued strength in residential construction supports future infrastructure and nonresidential activity.\nThe residential market accounted for 20% of third quarter aggregate shipments. To conclude our discussion on end-users, heritage aggregate shipments to the ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining third quarter shipments and increased 6%, reflecting improved ballast shipments for the Midwest and Rocky Mountain Divisions. Heritage aggregates pricing improved 3%. The combination of product and geographic mix lowered the company's average selling price by $0.13 per ton or 1%.\nThe Mid-America Group which includes the Carolina's, posted heritage pricing growth of nearly 3% reflecting the impact of weather and a higher percentage of lower priced ballast shipments. Product mix, muted heritage pricing growth for the Southeast Group to 2%, as our offshore operations opportunistically shipped more lower priced sand material.\nDouble digit pricing growth in Colorado was partially offset by product mix and reduced long haul shipments in Texas, resulting in a 3% increase in West Group pricing. Factoring in, expected full year product and geographic mix, heritage aggregates pricing is expected to increase 3% to 4% for 2018. The recently acquired Bluegrass Materials operations remain on track in 2018, despite Maryland's second wettest year on record. As a reminder selling prices for these operations are 10% to 15% below our corporate average.\nSynergy realization is progressing ahead of plan. Cement shipments and pricing increased 8% and 3% respectively, reflecting positive demand in the vibrant Texas economy. Importantly, both our Midlothian and Hunter operations reported double digit volume growth prior to September's record rainfall, highlighting the underlying demand in our Texas markets. Our Cement business has recently announced an $8 per ton price increase effective April 2019.\nTurning to our downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 3%, with solid gains throughout the Rocky Mountain and Southwest Divisions, despite September's record rainfall in Texas. Overall, third quarter ready mixed concrete prices increased 3%, with solid improvements in most markets.\nIn Colorado, project delays and permitting issues led to the 9% decrease in hot mixed asphalt shipments. Pricing was relatively flat as more contractors bid on both a reduced number of as well as more geographically concentrated Colorado DOT projects. This transitory situation should improve in 2019 with greater Colorado DOT funding, and more dispersed public works.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our third quarter financial results.\nJames Nickolas -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Ward. The Building Materials business achieved products and services revenues of $1.1 billion, a 12% increase, and an all-time record for the company. Gross profit increased 7% to $288 million. These results included $61 million product revenue contribution from the acquired Bluegrass operations and adjusted gross margins comparable with our heritage Mid-Atlantic and Southeast operations.\nOverall, aggregates product gross margin was 30.4% which includes $8 million negative impact, related to selling the acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding this impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 31.6%. We're relatively flat compared with the prior year quarter, despite weather disruptions and higher diesel expenses that negatively impacted our quarterly cost and efficiency profile. As Ward mentioned, our cement operations benefited from volume and pricing growth in Texas, leading to a 210 basis point expansion of product gross margin to 33.1%.\nMagnesia Specialties once again posted record revenues and profitability, as the business benefits from increased global demand for magnesia chemical products, as well as strong domestic steel production. Operating efficiencies and lower unit energy costs contributed to a 370 basis points expansion in product gross margin to 39.2%. During the third quarter we commenced a planned restructuring initiative to consolidate 20 sites in the associated mixer truck fleet for Southwest ready mix concrete operations. These actions are designed to improve the long-term profitability of the Southwest business.\nWe incurred a $7 million restructuring charge, which is recorded in other operating expenses for the West Group, for related asset impairment and severance costs. This restructuring should pay for itself in less than 12 months. Our strong cash flow allowed us to repurchase 305,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $60 million during the quarter.\nIn addition to share repurchases, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase to our quarterly cash dividend payment in August. This is one of the larger percentage increases in the company's annual dividend and indicative of our positive business outlook. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have steadily maintained or increased our dividend, including throughout the long years of the Great Recession. We have now returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends and share repurchases since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015.\nWe also made a contribution of $150 million to our qualified, defined benefit plan during the quarter. As a result this plan is now fully funded and we were able to deduct these contributions out of 2017 federal income tax return at a higher rate compared with the new lower corporate federal income tax rate for 2018. For the trailing 12 months ended September 2018, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the applicable credit agreement was 2.72 times.\nWe expect to be modestly above the top end of our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times at year-end, remaining well within our covenants in our credit agreement. 2018 capital expenditures are currently expected to be $375 million, down from our initial full-year guidance of $450 million to $500 million. This reduction is largely a function of managing project timing as well as prioritizing projects, focused on capital efficiency and higher returns.\nMartin Marietta will continue to further shareholder value, by opportunistically deploying free cash flow, through growing dividends and share repurchases, as well as value-enhancing acquisitions and improving organic investment, all while returning to our target leverage ratio. We remain on track to again deliver record revenues and EBITDA for the full year. And as detailed in today's release, we updated our full year 2018 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations.\nWe now expect heritage aggregate shipments to range from flat to up 1% and heritage pricing to increase in the range of 3% to 4%. On a consolidated basis, we expect total revenues to range from $4,135 million to $4,255 million and adjusted EBITDA to range from $1,100 million to $1,145 million.\nWith that I'll turn the call back over to Ward.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks Jim. We're confident about Martin Marietta's outlook, given the disciplined execution of our strategic plan and our attractive geographic footprint. Looking ahead to 2019, we anticipate mid-single digit growth in both aggregates shipment and pricing. The demand for our construction materials combined with widespread customer optimism is strong and we see no signs of these dynamics will abate in either the short or longer-term. Importantly, we have the ability and capacity to meet future market demands.\nRemember, our overall aggregate shipments are still 10% below mid-cycle demand with key states such as Georgia and Maryland, home to the majority, to form Bluegrass operations, along with North Carolina, 20% to 25% below mid-cycle demand. We fully intend to benefit from the strong underlying demand dynamics and believe the current construction cycle will continue to grow at a steady pace in 2019 for each of the company's three primary construction end-use markets.\nIf the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.\nKathryn Thompson -- Thompson Research Group. -- Analyst\nHi. Thank you for taking the questions today. First just focusing on the 2019 outlook really a two-part question. What gives you confidence for the mid-single digit volume and pricing for 2019? And layering in -- on that, with the acceleration of public lettings in Texas, Colorado and Georgia, could you talk about the types of projects you're seeing? Are these overlay our larger type projects? Because extensively that would play into your 2019 outlook. Thank you.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood afternoon, Katherine and thanks for your question. I think part of what you just said, answers the first part of it. So if we come back and say, looking at state lettings and contract awards in Florida, they're up 21%; in North Carolina they're up 65%; and Texas they're up 33%. So when we're looking at that type of activity in the public area, where as you know over the last several years it's been below 40% of our volumes. We think this is good evidence that it's heading back toward more traditional areas as well, at least on a percentage basis, because as you recall we typically range from 45% to 48%, not less than 40%.\nSo if we're looking at that and we expect more public activity, we think that's actually very good. We think in those states it's very good. Here's what we also see. We're seeing more design build work and design build work typically means larger and more complicated projects. In many places we see this replacing some P3 work which we actually think is really quite good. So from your perspective Katharine, there are larger jobs, they're more complicated jobs, oftentimes they have to multiple primes and those types of work are typically from the ground up. And what I mean by that is you'll see the entire array of aggregate products from base material, at the very beginning of projects to clean stone, as it's incorporated into asphalt or concrete as we go through. I think that's the biggest piece on infrastructure.\nWe also feel good about nonres and we feel good about res. If we're looking at the Dodge Momentum Index, that and the ABI both remain positive. We're looking at the next large wave of multi-year energy projects coming into Texas, and really as we go into 2019. And the other thing that strikes us is in Martin Marietta markets housing still remains very strong. I mean we're looking at housing numbers this year that are still well below the 50-year average of 1.5 million starts. We see that there is not enough new or existing homes available to meet current demand.\nWe're talking with homebuilders and listening to their commentary as well, and they're seeing strong housing fundamentals. And I think the other piece of it, that's important is, if you think about where the majority of our footprint is, it's southeastern and southwestern. And we feel like those geographies really offer superior opportunities for housing in the near term and the longer term. So I hope that answered both parts of your question, Kathryn.\nKathryn Thompson -- Thompson Research Group. -- Analyst\nIt did. And tagging onto infrastructure, aggregate shipments were flat in the quarter, given North Carolina, Texas, weather delays. If the weather had been sustained in July and August through September any idea how shipments would have shaked out?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think if we had seen that go the way that we though it would, I think shipments would have been up 12% for the quarter, and that's very much in keeping with what we've thought, seeing that type of double digit performance for the quarter, was wholly consistent with what we see in underlying market demand. And that's what gives us the type of confidence that we have looking into 2019 as well, Kathryn.\nKathryn Thompson -- Thompson Research Group. -- Analyst\nOkay. And then in shipments in the Southeast Group increased nearly 12%. Is this a sign we're seeing improved long-haul distribution in the Florida yards? Is seems that signal the easing of bottleneck in rails or other factors? And maybe just because rails have been such a focus for this year, any color on that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Kathryn. I think it's twofold. Number one, business was better in Atlanta and we think that will continue to be the case. And number two, business was improving at the Florida yards. Florida DOT has a very good DOT budget this year, they're going to have a very similar looking budget next year. And obviously the more we see going into Florida the better. Keep in mind the southeastern pricing still would have had a headwind, relative to more lower priced sand products coming into that market from offshore as well. So what I would say is, as we look at that overall market, we think it's attractive and we think it's early attractive.\nKathryn Thompson -- Thompson Research Group -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you so much.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Kathryn.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nPhil Ng -- Jefferies. -- Analyst\nHey, guys. 12% heritage volumes in aggregates export, it was certainly very strong. Can you parse out what markets really stood out for you, given some of the bottlenecks you're seeing in rail and labor? Is this level sustainable as we look at 2019?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood afternoon, Phil. The markets that were particularly looking good, Mid-Atlantic was looking good; North Carolina was demonstrating good attractive growth. We were seeing good attractive growth in the southeast; we were seeing attractive growth in Texas when the weather was dry and we're seeing attractive growth in the Midwest when the weather was dry. So as we look across the vast majority of our footprint, we were seeing good activity in all of them. And the other thing that I think it's important Phil, as we look into 2019, what I would tell you, is each one of our division presence, I think they're going to have a better 2019 than they did 2018. So I hope that's helpful.\nPhil Ng -- Jefferies. -- Analyst\nOkay. That's really helpful. And then your ready-mix and asphalt business margins were under pressure a little bit. Asphalt, I would imagine a good chunk of your business is more than a pass-through dynamic to liquid asphalt. Can you help quantify that? And how quickly can you be get caught up? And then on the ready-mix side, I think it was up. Did weather limit some of the momentum in Texas? And how should we think about margin there being all caught up? Thanks.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nAbsolutely. So if we look at the ready-mix business what I would say is twofold. A very attractive healthy ready-mix business in Colorado, we were clearly weather affected in Texas. You still saw volumes up in Texas, despite the fact that it was the wettest September on record. So I would say those would be the primary drivers relative to the Texas business. If we think about asphalt, all by itself, what I will say is this, you had larger projects in Colorado this year, but there were fewer of them. So you had large projects, more focused around Denver, so it's a practical matter, you are seeing more contractors buying for fewer but larger projects. We think that rule is actually changing next year and we're likely to see much more work up and down the I-25 carter, which is what we've typically seen. You might have seen that really even as we got to our mid-year the general tax revenues in Colorado were so attractive, that Colorado was looking to let a good bit of work in calendar year -- calendar quarter Q4, right now. So again, I think that was the single-largest driver relative to hot mix.\nAnd you also had liquid pricing moving up. I do think in many respects that's going to be helpful relative to hot mix pricing. That's not something we're particularly concerned about, because most of our projects are indexed in that state, and we do have our own storage facility not far outside (inaudible).\nSo again, Phil, I hope that was helpful.\nPhil Ng -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nVery helpful. Thanks a lot. Good luck on the quarter.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Schrier of Citi. Your line is open.\nScott Schrier -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\nHi, good afternoon. Just looking at the aggregates margins and obviously there is a lot of noise in there with fixed cost absorption efficiencies and cost. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about the overall environment, say for markets that weren't impacted by weather or North Carolina, Texas when they were dry, how did the price cost and how the operating efficiencies are looking in aggregates currently?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, when the volumes are working, the way that we saw the volumes working in July and August, Scott, the cost profile, the pricing everything else is actually working just as you would expect. I mean you nailed it. The fact is, if you look at our North Carolina and Texas which are two outsized disproportionately important states in North Carolina. When those two have types of events that we saw in Q3, we're going to feel it. So actually, as I step back and take a look at that business, recognize saying what it had endured in those two states and the results that we put up, actually feel quite good about that. And again, I think to the extent that you believe as we do, that 2019 is going to be a year where you see good volumes in those states, I think it actually portends very well for what we see in the year ahead.\nScott Schrier -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\nGot it. And then just following up on your earlier comment on design build, I mean obviously you can control what you can control and there is a lot of external factors that have, I guess you, investors everybody frustrated with how volumes are going. And the one thing I'm thinking is, it's really good that you're talking about these larger type project and we see it in the transportation award that's projects are getting larger. But with that -- did that carry may be a higher tendency for certain projects to get cancelled or more lumpiness and ongoing delays? I guess I'm just worried or concerned or what do you think that if we sit here 12 months today on the earnings call, the commentary we'll talk about will have a lot of large projects and backlog, but these kind of projects get delayed. Such as any color around how you see that playing out?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nMy general view is design build jobs are ones that we should celebrate. Because if you go back to some of the things that I think you've heard from the industry over the past several years, that times some of the holdups have been in getting design work out of DOTs because of labor constraints. I think to the extent that you're seeing large JVs come forward with design-build projects in today's environment, I think that actually serves to accelerate contract delivery and execution.\nThe other thing that I believe, that I think is really going to help Scott, is keep in mind the more public work we see going on, particularly design builds or others. These typically will have good hard finish dates relative to them. And I think that's also going to keep good pace to the overall construction activity. You don't see that as much in nonres, you clearly don't see it as much in residential. So as I look at in a higher degree of design build, I actually view that as good news for the industry and in that context, a means of building materials industry.\nScott Schrier -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for that.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Scott.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nYes, hi, good afternoon.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nWard, can you talk about the cadence of pricing that you've seen over the course of this year? And what have you seen for aggregates specifically in terms of competitor pricing discipline? How is the situation involve this year compared to last year?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think this year has gone -- if you look at where we're guiding, we're guiding very much within the range that we talked about at the beginning of the year. What I'm seeing right now relative to next year, actually it looks to be a better environment in many respects, because I think people recognize the underlying demand is so strong. I mean here is something that we can look at internally Jerry, and I think it underscores why we feel good about the pricing.\nWe're going into 2019 with all of our downstream businesses having our largest backlogs in their history. And what we're hearing from many of our customers is they're in the same place. So it's a practical matter, it's not unusual for a sophisticated downstream customer, to not want to run away from our price increase, because in many respects that helps them in their business all by themselves. So at this point, we'll obviously come out later with more definitive guidance relative to pricing in 2019. But we're certainly seeing clean stone increases in many areas between the $1 and $2 a ton. And I think that actually gives you a great snapshot of what we are hearing relative to demand and how people are looking at 2019.\nJerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nAnd as you think about the cost structure from here, this year in a challenging weather environment, you're going to be growing EBITDA a touch faster than sales, if we see the picture of mid-single digit volume and mid-single digit pricing playing out next year. I guess can you go back to seeing EBITDA growing three times the level of sales growth? Or any moving pieces we should keep in mind about the cost structure 2019 versus 2018?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think much of it goes back to some of the commentary that we made in the prepared remarks. And that is, take a look at the part of the country that's still operating considerably below mid-cycle. And if you start seeing the type of performance out of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and others, that certainly population trends would indicate. Those are some of the most powerful places in which we operate and that would clearly drive EBITDA in some very different ways.\nThe other thing that I will remind you is coming into the year, this year, obviously cement has had, again what I think it's a pretty attractive year. But we also came into the year having done a large capital project on our Midlothian plant last year. And we were little bit slow coming out of the gate in January and February in the cement market in Texas. So again if you think about, what I believe it's going to be a very attractive Texas cement market next year and a very attractive southeastern and Mid-Atlantic aggregates market next year. I'll let you do the math, but again I think those are markets that probably help answer your questions, as well as anything.\nJerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Jerry.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Wood of Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.\nMichael Wood -- Nomura Instinet -- Analyst\nHi. Good afternoon.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Mike.\nMichael Wood -- Nomura Instinet -- Analyst\nIf you talk about industry bottlenecks, Texas in particular, I'm curious when pent-up demand gets released in more normal weather, what are the industry constraints the growth in particular public spending in nonres?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think from our perspective there is not any. So if you're looking at it purely from a Martin Marietta perspective, we can put on the ground whatever contractors require. I think one of the issues the contractors are working through right now is simply relative to labor inputs going on with respect to trucking. And here a couple of things that I would point out to you, in the host of our markets we're simply seeing contracts working longer hours and working weekends, that's not a surprise, the end of the year is coming.\nWe're also seeing truck driver shortages being addressed in several ways. We see in a number of markets the housing dollar bonus is being given to drivers, drivers are being given free healthcare. But here is some stats, that I think are important to keep in mind, Mike. HEC put out a report in August 2018 and 62% of contractors have turned to base pay increases, because they recognize the need to get more people in to do the work. And I think if you come back and say, has labor been an issue for contractors through this year? It absolutely has. Has trucking been a shortage? It has. I think people are addressing it.\nOne of our large contractors here in North Carolina would tell me, he is going to have a record year and every day there are 10% fewer trucks available than he wishes. And you know what, that's not something that I think is going to persist. So again, I do think rail has also been a bit of a bottleneck this year. I do see that getting better. You can listen to the earnings calls from the different Class I railroads, I think they're very focused on dealing with this. And we do see progress in that regard. So are there bottlenecks? There are. Are they on our end? They're not. Do we see them in large part getting better? We do.\nMichael Wood -- Nomura Instinet -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. And since it's election day are there any midterm votes that you're watching in terms of state level infrastructure propositions that you might want to call our attention to?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWhat I would tell you is, let's all watch that together. I think, (inaudible) would tell you that there are over 300 ballot initiatives on various ballots today. That gives you a great feel for simply how many projects there are out there and how many jurisdictions we're looking at it. One of the things that we would just watch because we're curious, we're anxious to see how things go in Colorado this evening.\nWe think Colorado is going to be in a great place if nothing happens. But keep in mind, there are two different ballot initiatives in that state this evening. One inspirationally called Let's Go, Colorado, and the other a little bit more bluntly, Fix Our Damn Roads. So we'll watch that carefully and see how that shakes out.\nMichael Wood -- Nomura Instinet -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Mike.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Stanley Elliott of Stifel.\nStanley Elliott -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nHey, there. Good morning, good afternoon. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. Quick question on the CapEx spend and the deferral piece. Does that slip into next year? How do we think about CapEx? And I guess the root of the question is that you're too seven-ish (ph) right now, I mean it's not hard to think that you guys could get below two times in terms of a net debt-to-EBITDA next year, and I'm just trying to frame up some of the casual implications.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nLook, I'll address the CapEx, then turn it over to Jim to give you a little bit more color. Here is what I would say, look, we've been spending CapEx above DD&A for the past several years. And I think we've actually spent it very well. I think if we're looking at something below $400 million this year as we really look at the full year, I would tell you that's probably not a bad ZIP code for you to start thinking about next year as well. We're going to be focused on CapEx that really gives the type of return that we expect and you would expect, so we probably will see that dial back just a little bit. But I know your question was more than just about CapEx, so let me turn the balance of it over to Jim to respond.\nJames Nickolas -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So, Stanley, the company's capital allocation priorities are unchanged. The first call on capital is the right acquisition that will enable our successful execution of our growth plan, follow with investing in business in organic growth and CapEx that Ward mentioned being relatively constant to the next year. And then beyond that, returning cash to shareholders through a meaningful, sustainable dividend, all while targeting -- and the share repurchases, all while targeting our 2 to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Just going to point out, in the last six months, we've completed the second largest acquisition in the company's history, which was all cash and debt financed. Since then, we've de-risked the balance sheet, paying down debt and funding our qualified defined benefit plan.\nAdditionally, as we mentioned, we bought back shares in Q3, $60 million worth. It's been about 1.5 years since we repurchased shares, so we're back in the market. We also increased the dividend 9% this August. So, we're very -- feeling very good about our future. And with the equity market sales of late, we view our shares as cheap and we'll be actively considering share repurchases. We'll be opportunistic to the balanced approach with our cash flows. But, again, given our positive outlook for the future and our expectations for growing earnings, share repurchases will be funded through cash flow from operations going forward.\nWe are focused on lowering our leverage to within our target ratio. We're going to keep strengthening the balance sheet. But, again, given the cheap stock price, we're going to be looking at that as well. All-in-all, we're taking a balanced approach and we expect to fund the needs of the business, repay debt and repurchase shares, all while de-levering over the next 12 months.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nHey Stanley, I guess the punch line is, we've got a high-class problem. I think we're going to be in a place that we can fund our CapEx the way that we need to. I think we do transactions really well. I think we've got a team that not only does the transactions themselves well, but I know we have an operating team that makes them perform extraordinarily well. And again, being in a position that we can take a look at share buybacks and doing things like we're doing with the dividend, puts us in a very attractive spot and we're going to enjoy this and take advantage of it.\nStanley Elliott -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nYeah, no doubt. And then the aggregate pricing sounds very good. Cement pricing, you talked about the $8 per ton. Can you talk about kind of the confidence? Sometimes the cement pricing tends to be a little more volatile, I guess. What are you seeing in the Texas market that gives you confidence that the $8 is a good number for us in the coming year?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, what I would encourage you to do is just do some other channel checks and get a sense of where you think competitors are there as well. And my guess is, you'll get some comfort when you look at that. That's certainly what we're seeing as we hear from customers and others in that marketplace. I think the other piece of it goes back to some of the commentary that I offered before. And that is the downstream businesses backlogs are really very, very high. And this was a year in which cement was relatively tight in Texas. I think you could certainly see that next year as well.\nAnd again, the location of those plants and where I think we are in the cycle is what gives me the type of confidence around that, that I have as we go into 2018 -- into 2019, forgive me.\nStanley Elliott -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nPerfect. Appreciate the time and congrats on a nice work in a tough year.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you so much, Stanley.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Stevenson -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nHey, this is Jeff Stevenson on for Garik. My first question is on weather impacted markets and how long North Carolina, for example, takes to normalize? Do you expect this to potentially bleed into next year? And if so has it factored into your guidance?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nI don't think it's going to bleed into next year. Obviously, it's significantly affected the quarter. As I indicated in the prepared remarks, we did have two quarries in the eastern part of the state that ended up being a catcher's mitt for a lot of floodwater. What I'd tell you is, sadly, we have gotten pretty good at this, and we build up inventories at those eastern locations recognizing that if a hurricane comes along, we need to be able to sell materials. So I don't think we're going to be in material shortage land around either Belgrade or Castle Hayne. Those are the two quarries had been filled with water. We are undertaking pumping at those quarries.\nMy guess is, if we're looking at Belgrade, it's probably four to six months to get the water out of there. Castle Hayne actually has a little bit more. It has about 8 billion gallons of water in it. That's probably going to be closer to six to nine months. However, I do not anticipate that being a market situation as we go into next year. We're going to have run some, pumps. I mean, that's going to cost us modestly more money for some period of time. But I don't see that being something that, if I'm you and I'm modeling out 2019, I'm not putting that very high or my very best.\nJeffrey Stevenson -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nGreat. Great. And I just had a question on incremental margins for next year with a potentially stronger demand environment and relatively easier comps, could there be any upward bias?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, again, I'll take you back to the geography. We will give you a good view of 2019 when we come out in February, so I don't want to get too far over my skis right now. But, obviously, what we see right now for 2019 looks attractive and like the geographies, Jeff. So I'll leave it at that for right now.\nJeffrey Stevenson -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nOkay. And then lastly, cement guidance was put down slightly, I was just wondering if you could provide any more color on the buckets driving that?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think primarily it was September rains, that was your big single issue. But I know Jim had some comments on cement as well.\nJames Nickolas -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIf your question's on Q3, it was September rains, if your question's on Q4, it's the rains we've already seen in October, so far for Texas.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo we try to take everything we've seen into account with a full year of the little bit that's left in 2018.\nJeffrey Stevenson -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Jeff.\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer -- Thompson Davis -- Analyst\nHey, good afternoon.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nHello.\nAdam Thalhimer -- Thompson Davis -- Analyst\nWard, I wanted to start first on the ready-mix pricing, which increased over $5 sequentially. Just curious what drove that?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'm sorry, what my take was on that?\nAdam Thalhimer -- Thompson Davis -- Analyst\nOn ready mix, pricing.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Look, I think, clearly, you've got a very attractive ready mix market in Colorado with high barriers to entry and a very good ready mix business. I think, clearly, we were seeing the type of increases in Texas that you would expect to see, given the types of backlogs that are there and what I think can be a tightness in that market in many respects. So, I think in most regards, Adam, it's the sign of a good healthy marketplace with good underlying demand. So, I think those are your primary drivers.\nAdam Thalhimer -- Thompson Davis -- Analyst\nSo there's nothing unusual in Q2 that can stay at that level?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, there was nothing unusual in Q2. In fact, the things that were unusual in Q2 or Q3 were more things in our face, not things at our back.\nAdam Thalhimer -- Thompson Davis -- Analyst\nAnd then the pricing -- aggregates pricing for 2019, how does that -- does that start to flow through mostly in January next year?\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt varies. Some price increases will go on in January, some increases may go on in, in April. Look, if you're sitting where I am and where you are, you've got biased toward January. My guess is most will go in January. I think a good number will go in April. And the simple fact is, construction doesn't really get under way in earnest until the second half of March. So it's more of an optical issue than a real issue. But I think you'll probably have most going in January, you will have some that will going in April.\nAdam Thalhimer -- Thompson Davis -- Analyst\nPerfect. Okay, thanks Ward.\nHoward Nye -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue.
