Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I get into the results of the quarter, I'd like to share a couple of exciting milestones for Gentherm, as shown on Slide 4. Earlier this month, we received our very first automotive new PACE award.\nThis prestigious recognition is a testament to Gentherm's world-class technology team and their dedication to excellence in delivering an industry-leading battery thermal management solution for Mercedes. The Gentherm team worked under a very tight deadline to develop an innovative approach to help solve a critical problem our customer was facing. In a very short time from the initial discussion with Daimler, we were able to develop a prototype, design, and integration concept, simulate test and validate the product. With the increasing adoption of 48-volt miles hybrid systems, we are well-positioned to provide our customers with cutting-edge battery thermal solutions.\nReceiving a PACE award marks another milestone in Gentherm's mission to create and deliver extraordinary thermal solutions and we look forward to continuing to build on our track record of launching innovative industry-first products. On the heels of winning the PACE award, our global team impress customers and partners at the Shanghai Auto Show. At the Gentherm booth, we showcased our personalized passenger thermal solution inside Rin Speed's latest autonomous concept vehicle the micro snap. In addition, we displayed our industry leading climate comfort solutions, award-winning battery thermal management technologies, and innovative electronic control units.\nSystems were also very well represented through vehicles that were highlighted at the show by global OEMs. To name a few: [Inaudible] were all displaying our thermal technologies. I'm proud of the team that worked hard to put Gentherm on the global stage. This is a true testament of the tremendous talent we have at Gentherm.\nNow let's turn to the quarter. While headwinds across the automotive industry continue to present challenges for us during the first quarter, I'm pleased we're able to deliver revenue growth in our core business. Including the impact of foreign currency translation, we were able to deliver 3%organic revenue growth in our core business. In addition, we delivered approximately 3% organic revenue growth in automotive despite the challenging automotive production environment.\nTthe year-over-year organic revenue growth in our automotive business outpaced the market by 900 basis points. For the third consecutive quarter, we saw year over year revenue growth for our climate control seat or CCF business and we also continued to see momentum in market launches and our awards of $400 million in the first quarter of 2019 surpassed last year's first quarter. We continue to make significant progress on our focused growth and margin expansion activities and we're seeing positive results in our financials. Operating expenses declined double digit year over year in the first quarter.\nAs I shared with you on our 2018 year-end earnings call, we're turning our fit-for-growth cost reduction efforts toward gross margin expansion and we're starting to see some early signs of progress in the first quarter. We achieved adjusted EBITDA margin rate of 14.2% in our core business. Matteo will provide more details about our financial results in a few minutes. Now let's turn to Slide 5.\nThe strong execution by our automotive team continued in the first quarter with launches of systems on 12 different nameplate models across eight OEMs. These figures incorporate the continued momentum we're seeing with our CCS product with multiple launches. A few examples, the Hyundai Sonata and the Peugeot 508. During the quarter, we launched a number of new programs and luxury vehicles, including a net conditioner for the Ferrari California and a heated interior system for the Bentley Flying Spur, further confirming the market demand for increased thermal comfort content.\nIn addition, we continue to make progress on climate sense development and validation with multiple OEMs. This is part of the previously announced development contracts. We also successfully completed the development of a new human-based thermal comfort measurement model with a strategic partner. These unique initiatives position Gentherm Gen therm to deliver enha-ced thermal comfort solutions tailored to the autonomous electrified and ridesharing ecosystem of the future.\nNow on to Slide 6, where you can see that we're continuing to win new business at a healthy pace. In the first quarter, we secured $400 million in new program awards across 16 different customers. We won multiple CCS awards, including platform wins with the Hyundai Creta, Kia Grand Carnival, and the Lincoln Navigator. We received steering wheel heater awards across six OEMs, including the Audi A6, Cadillac CT5, Honda Civic, and Jeep Grand Cherokee.\nIn addition, I'd like to highlight several strategic thermal comfort awards from global OEMs that will increase our content on a number of important vehicle platforms, including a heated interior award for the BMW I-20 electric vehicle, a steering wheel heater award for the Audi EV platforms, and a net conditioner award for the Lexus LF-LC convertible. On the battery thermal management front, we continue to make progress in expanding our business. Winning an award from General Motors for our air cooling BTM system. In addition, and of strategic importance for the company, a large Asian battery manufacturer awarded Gentherm our first innovative full BEV or electric vehicle battery heating contract.\nThis was for a large North American OEM, which leverages our proprietary technology. Adding battery heating to our portfolio of thermal electric and air cooling BTM technologies positions us well to achieve our growth aspirations. Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion on our Industrial segment. In Gentherm medical, revenue in the first quarter grew 12% over the first quarter of 2018 and 20% over the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWe saw continued strong growth in Blanketrol, our liquid-base patient thermal management solution across the U.S., Latin America, and Asia Pacific. We had several large conquest orders, including both equipment and consumables, from the likes of Barnes, Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Banner Health in Phoenix, and Mass General in Boston. On our last earnings call, I shared with you that we continue to invest in developing next-generation products and upgrading our existing portfolio with additional launches this year.\nAugmenting our in-house R&D efforts, earlier this month, we acquired Steeler Electronic in [Inaudible] Germany for $15 million. Steeler's resistive warming products allow us to further strengthen our operating room Patient Norm-O-Thermia portfolio. To summarize, while the challenges presented by the global auto industry persist, I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make. I remain proud of the hard work and commitment of the exceptionally talented global Gentherm team.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Matteo for a little more color on the financial results.\nMatteo Anversa -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Phil, and thank you to everyone joining the call today. Before I get into the details of the results, let me spend a minute talking about two minor adjustments that we made to some of the previously reported first-quarter 2018 financials. So first, we have reclassified $2.7 million of amortization of customer relationships from a contract revenue item into SG&A. This impacted revenue for other automotive as well as revenue for each of our industrial businesses for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe annual impact for 2018 was $10.2 million increase in both product revenue and SG&A. And as a result, the gross margin rate was impacted positively by 70 basis points. Second, $865,000 of restructuring charges occurred in the first quarter of 2018 but were initially classified as SG&A. They were reclassified as restructuring charges in June of last year after we announced our strategic update plans.\nWe have now reflected this $865,000 in the first quarter of 2018 income statement as restructuring and these adjustments impacted first quarter 2018 adjusted EPS by $0.02. Both the amortization of customer relationships and restructuring adjustments impacted the EBITDA margin rate by 20 basis points for the first quarter of 2018. With that, I'll now start on Slide 8 and focus on the items that most significantly impacted our first-quarter results. So for the quarter, product revenues declined by 2.5% compared to the same period of last year.\nWhile we outpaced the market in the automotive segment, where revenues were flat year over year, whe industrial segment declined by almost 30%, primarily due to the disposition of this year's industrial chamber business. We adjust for the impact of effects, our overall organic revenue was flat. Automotive segment revenue grew 2.8% organically year over year. This was achieved despite the headwinds in the global vehicle production.\naccording to IHS latest data for our key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan, and Korea, light vehicle production in the first quarter declined almost 7% year over year and approximately 200 basis points below their mid-February forecast. Our automotive business outpaced the market as the result of the continued strength in our CCS product line, where revenues was up 7% year over year. Additionally, revenue in BTM more than doubled compared to the same period of last year, primarily due to the PACE award winning team solution that Phil just discussed. This revenue increase was offset by a declining seat heaters, which were down 18 -- 12%, primarily due to a decline in GM and [Inaudible] sales in China as well as our conscious decision to walk away from low-margin business.\nAdditionally, we have seen a few programs upgrading from heat only to CCS. Automotive cables also declined about 12% due to the decreased orders from a large Tier 1 customer in Germany. And electronics revenue was also down 15% year over year, primarily due to the continued slowdown in the RV industry. If we move to the industrial, segment Industrial revenue declined almost 30% compared to the first quarter of last year.\nThe decline in revenue was primarily due to the lower sales in DSC industrial chamber business, which as you know was sold in February as well as from the GPT business. As you know, both businesses were classified as held-for-sale in the second half of last year. On the positive side, we saw continued strength in our medical business where revenues increased more than 12% year over year due to the higher Blanketrol sales in North America. If we move to gross margin, gross margin for the first quarter was 29.2%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.\nHowever, gross margin improved 150 basis points sequentially compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily due to higher labor cost as well as timing differences between the annual customer price decreases and the supplier cost reductions. In addition, there was a negative impact from tariffs and lower margin in BTM associated with the launch phase of our new actively cooled technology program. These were partially offset by improved fixed cost leverage from higher-unit volume as well as cost reductions driven by fit-for-growth.\nJust to add a couple of more details, the labor cost increases were mostly incurred at our production facilities in Mexico, where whereas you may recall, we adjusted our wage rates to align with the new minimum wage requirements as well as increased headcount as we ramped up the [Inaudible] plant. On tariffs, while we were able to mitigate some of the impact as a result of the efforts from our sourcing team, the net negative impact in the quarter was approximately $800,000, which is pretty much in line with what we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. And at this point, we continue to expect the annual impact of tariffs to be in the range of $3 million to $5 million. While our gross margin rate was below last year's first quarter, we are pleased with the 150-basis-point sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThis was primarily driven by improved efficiencies in our plants, mostly Mexico, and a higher gross margin and BTM. Moving to the operating expenses, operating expenses in the quarter were $53.5 million. Now this amount included $1.9 million of restructuring charges, mostly related to fit-for-growth and a $1.1 million of CFO transition expenses. If we adjust for the restructuring charges in both periods and for the CFO transition cost, operating expenses were $50.5 million, down from $59.7 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nNow this year-over-year decline of more than 15% was primarily driven by the impact of the fit-for-growth cost-reduction initiatives, lower expenses for cash settle stock options as well as the sales of the CSC industrial chamber business. Also in the quarter, as we are continuously evaluate the fair value of our assets held for sale, we recorded a $10.5 million impairment related to our GPT business. Adjusting for the non-deductible impact of this impairment charge, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.7%. Finally, our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.55 a share compared to $0.52 a share in the first quarter of last year.\nIf we turn to Slide 9, I'll walk you through the balance sheet. So our cash position in the quarter was $41.3 million, including $2.5 million of restricted cash coming from the disposition of the CSC industrial chamber business. Our cash position in the quarter increased by $1.7 million. We generated $6.8 million in cash from operating activities during the quarter and we had approximately $8 million of cash outlay for our share repurchase program.\nNow let me make a comment on this point. Given the recent uncertainties in the macroeconomic condition and the automotive market, we slowed down our share repurchase program in the quarter. However, we will look for opportunities to ramp up the program over the remainder of the authorization period depending on the market conditions. We also received $47.5 million of proceeds from the sale of the CSC industrial chamber business in the quarter.\nAnd as a result, our net debt decreased by $41 million from $100 million at the end of 2018 to $59 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019. As of the end of the first quarter, the total debt stands at approximately $100 million and our revolving line of credit availability stands at approximately $260 million. If we move to Slide 10 in guidance, based on the first quarter results, we are maintaining our 2019 guidance in 2021 outlook. Now given the current global automotive production forecast for 2019, it is likely that our revenue growth rate excluding the impact of foreign exchange will be at the lower end of our guidance range.\nWe do continue to see more of our growth coming in the second half of the year. In fact, the second quarter will be our most challenging quarter due to a few vehicles rolling off. However, we are expecting several new vehicle launches in the second half of the year. In summary, while we still have work to do to further improve our margins, we are pleased with the progress that we made in the first quarter.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to Devon to begin the Q&A session. \n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question from -- comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like some of your earliest identified fit-for-growth initiatives are making some impressive progress with operating expense. For example, really under control gross margin, as you point out in the release, though remains pressured year by year.\nHow should we think about the next evolution in fir-for-growth to tackle some of the gross margin headwinds that you are seeing in the business?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Ryan. Yes, that's a great question. As we've talked about in the in the last quarter, we continue to kind of refocus our energies on improvements that can drive gross margin. And some examples of that, clearly driving efficiencies locally at our operating plants, sharing best practices.\nWe find some good opportunities that we think will drive results there. We're also looking at our global footprint, finalizing some plans to potentially do some consolidations there. We're not quite ready to announce those yet but those are in finally valuation. We're also looking at value [Inaudible].\nWe think there's some pretty significant opportunities to take cost out of our product either by strategic sourcing decisions or material simplification and removals from our bill of materials. So those are all activities that are there in motion now. And we're certainly shifting more of our resources toward that to get us to the 30% to 32% that we're pushing toward for 2021.\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. Great. Thanks. And then can you talk about the acquisition and if we should expect additional acquisitions on the medical side with the materiality of these would be kind of what the multiples that you might pay or might be willing to pay for growth in medical companies and how you weigh that against repurchasing your own shares, likely at lower multiples, I would imagine.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I think the Steeler acquisition was a good representation of the type of acquisition we're looking for. It's really a product-based acquisition. Steeler has a technology -- resistive technology that fits really nicely into our portfolio.\nIts product is European-based, mostly actually in Germany where the sales are. And we see as a big opportunity to unleash that product in the North America market and leverage our direct sales force in North America. So that one fits real nice. It is relatively low revenue.\nJust a few million in revenue but a great product. And clearly we see probably a little bit higher multiples in medical. In this case, it certainly was a little higher than you would expect in maybe a core automotive acquisition, but we're being really selective. We're not going to do any big transformational acquisitions in the short term.\nWe're looking for technologies, products or maybe opportunities to expand our footprint in certain regions. So I think this is a good example. Certainly we could go a little bit bigger than this but it won't be significant.\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nGreat. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Ryan.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Koranda with ROTH Capital Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Koranda -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thanks. You mentioned Q2, some headwinds from some programs that are going to be rolling off in that quarter.\nSo just any help with the revenue cadence in automotive just given that expectation?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, we've got a couple of vehicles. We originally expected the roll-off to happen a little bit more in the second half, to be honest with you, on these specific vehicles but those are pulling into the second quarter. So toward the end of the quarter, we expect a little bit of impact from those. We're not giving quarterly guidance and I think we clearly maintained our revenue guidance for the full year with a little bit of pressure toward the lower end of that.\nI think that's kind of what we expect. We do see some nice launches coming in the second half, which would be a nice benefit for us.\nMatt Koranda -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. And then on CCS revenue, up 7% year on year during the quarter, maybe can you give some color on what enabled the outperformance versus market production? I mean, I guess, if I think about CCS traditionally, it's been primarily in North America-exposed for you guys. So was most of that new program launches in North America or were there other regions that contributed? And then how can we sort of expect that level of market outperformance to sustain through the year?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, I think it was -- we've got some higher application rates that we're seeing. We saw a couple programs launch with second row CCS, which helped. We're seeing, obviously, North Americas is a great market but we're seeing the strings of vehicles that are ramping up, volume that have transitioned from all heat to CCS for us. One example is the BMW X5 or X platform, I guess, is the best way to coin, the SUV is a global platform.\nThat's a good example of CCS taking taking off a little bit around the world. So multiple factors along that line. Of course, there were some negative effects built into that growth rate too with some of the market pressures around the world.\nMatt Koranda -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nOK. That's helpful. And then steering wheel heaters posted a rare year-over-year decline. Just wondering if you could comment on that -- is that just sort of an air pocket as you await the launch of incremental programs? How does revenue unfold in that category for the remainder of the year?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I think that's -- certainly that one, some specific vehicles that were launched on steering wheels saw a little bit of a slowdown specifically. We do expect that to continue to pickup. Also in the quarter, we talked a lot about some passenger vehicles that were cancelled by -- especially North America OEMs, and the few those had steering wheels -- a steering wheel heat for us associated with it. So some timing effects there.\nWe continue to win, as we announced -- as I just announced, as you saw on the slides significant wins. I'd say our win rate is extremely high in that space. So in general, we're looking good for longer-term growth.\nMatt Koranda -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nOK. Good to hear. And then, I guess, lastly on the gross margin, I know you referenced the pressure of timing of customer price decreases versus some of the supplier cost reductions that you guys typically get later in the year. Can you just help us understand the cadence of gross margin improvement for the remainder 2019? Should we interpret that commentary as we should be expecting gross margin expansion sequentially through the remainder of the year or -- just a little bit out there would be appreciated.\nMatteo Anversa -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, the -- so let me maybe quantify the -- I would say that they look at the 150-basis-point decline in gross margin compared to last year, I would say two-thirds of this was driven by the higher labor cost increase net of the volume leverage and then a third is the timing difference between the annual customer price decreases and the supplier cost reduction. This is going to slowly correct itself. So yes, the answer to your question is we are expecting gross margin to sequentially start to improve in the back end of the year.\nMatt Koranda -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nOK. So more of it was from the labor pressure, I guess?\nMatteo Anversa -- Chief Financial Officer\nCorrect. Correct.\nMatt Koranda -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nAny further upward pressure expected for the remainder 2019? I mean, how is that factored into your outlook?\nMatteo Anversa -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. That will stay because if you recall, the bulk of the wage increase that we had, particularly in Mexico, happened in the fourth quarter of last year. So we will experience that throughout the year. But as we work through some of the actions on fit-for-growth centered on the gross margin that Phil mentioned, we should see progressively an improvement on the gross margin and we keep guiding -- we are confirming the guidance to be in the range of 28% to 30%.\nMatt Koranda -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\nOK. Very helpful, guys. I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nThank you. The next -- our next question comes from the line of Richard Carlson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Carlson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Richard.\nMatteo Anversa -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nRichard Carlson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nSo, Phil, somebody talk a little more about that Bev battery heating award, sounds pretty exciting. I know you said it was with a North American OEM but is that going to be a global platform? What do you expect for the volume? When does it kick in? Are you having more conversations with other OEMs on that?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nRichard, I'm glad you asked that one. That's one we're really excited about. That's our -- just a little bit of context for those who might be a little bit new to us, we announced four product categories that we're really focused on the battery thermal management side. Obviously, the thermal electric active cool BTM product, which we just won a PACE award for, also air-cooling BTM.\nSo those are two we already have a nice portfolio, we're starting to see nice growth and then two that we called future product areas. One is battery cell heating and then the other is self-connecting cables or boards. And this award is in cell-heating, which is tailored toward high-voltage, full BEV applications. So this is a real breakthrough for us.\nThis is a new product category and we're obviously very optimistic that this is going to lead to significant growth. It was with a -- actually source directly with a large battery manufacturer in Asia and for a specific platform for North America OEM. Of course, we're hope -- and by the way, that launches in 2020. So it's a pretty quick turn program.\nThat one we're pretty optimistic will turn into something that can grow into more vehicles. And obviously, as we get closer to launch timing, we can hopefully announce the specific customer set there. But it's a big one we did. I think very importantly on this, it's a proprietary technology that we have that led to that award.\nSo we're pretty excited about that. It gives us a nice advantage competitively in the space. So that's -- I think that pretty much wraps up the details around that one.\nRichard Carlson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you for that. And now, I guess, just follow on with the strong bookings you had in the quarter, can you just share some metrics? I mean, what was that on a year-over-year basis? And then how are you trending with your average size of that? Is that something that actually matters to you, guys? I guess, and also the split between conquest wins and follow-ons.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK. Yes, I think it's -- if you look at the last year, our first two quarters were both less than $400 million on total awards. So to hit $400 million in the first quarter is good. I think it's a good sign that it's a pretty active year.\nSo I think that's good. In terms of conquest or let's call it incremental wins, there's about 30-plus-percent were incremental and 67% -- 60-ish, 60% to 70% were rewins in that bucket.\nRichard Carlson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. And then just one small question on the modeling. So I guess, you still had the the industrial chamber's business and GPT in revenue this quarter, was there any ETS contribution?\nMatteo Anversa -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt's very -- no, it's very minor.\nRichard Carlson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK. Great. Thanks, guys, appreciate it.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Richard.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Dwyer with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Dwyer -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning. I guess, just following up on that question, I think you'd indicated, Phil, last call that that those two businesses the CSA industrial is -- as well as GPT would be would be out of revenue were not included in guidance, etc., and then they were in this quarter. Just any color as to why you ended up putting those in? We still have them on our books so we're -- they're still hitting revenue so we're reporting actual numbers.\nGotcha.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI did -- yes. And we do have -- if you look at the tables in the press release, we do have it split out on revenue. And then, of course, I just mentioned that EBITDA for, what I call, core business was 14.2%.\nSteve Dwyer -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. And then you had mentioned, obviously, IHS production forecasts for the remainder of the year maybe a couple of percentage points lower than they were a few months ago. You guys have, obviously, held up well, reiterated guidance.\nWhere are you maybe seeing strength vis a vis those forecasts? Or what's turned out better for you such that you're -- able to kind of stick in that range? And new launches is one, for sure. We're launching new vehicles that helps. Battery thermal management growth, new technology, wind helps us outperform. And then penetration rates, growth of content in the vehicles.\nThose are the three big areas that are helping.\nGot it. And then lastly for me, you mentioned a couple of sort of end of programs here in the second quarter. Are those just vehicles going end of life? Are they somebody who's just you know basically taking the technology out? Any color on those. I guess, are they losses or are they just sort of vehicles end-of-life?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nA little bit of a mix. There are a couple walkways. We -- in fact, we had some of them in in this quarter but there -- we've been pretty selective over the last year or so on programs that don't reach our margin thresholds. So we're trying to pare back on a few of those.\nThere are a couple changeovers happening from one platform to another. In fact, that's going to be the biggest impact in the quarter and that's primarily it.\nSteve Dwyer -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nGot it. So walkaway is being you guys walking away from business versus somebody removing you etc.?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Oh, by the way, there's -- there are two or three programs that are -- vehicles that are going end-of-life altogether. And most that tied to the passenger vehicle cancellations.\nSteve Dwyer -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nGot it. That's helpful. That's all for me. Thanks, guys.\nMatteo Anversa -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question is from the line of Scott Stember with C.L. King. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Stember -- C.L. King and Associates -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Scott. Thank you.\nScott Stember -- C.L. King and Associates -- Analyst\nMaybe we could talk about on the CCF, the wards that you're getting today, the mix of active versus dense in those trends and again just remind us of when we would expect more of an active contribution whether it's in 2020 or 2021 coming out of backlog.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, we're still mostly getting the CCF awards right now but we're in -- I can tell, you we've got some really interesting discussions going on with a few OEMs around CCF active and we're -- we definitely see the demand starting to pick up and hopefully in the coming quarters we'll have some good news to share.\nScott Stember -- C.L. King and Associates -- Analyst\nOK. And as far as BTM goes, obviously, you've given in the past and, I guess, what your expectations for a full run rate would be and it seems like you continue to move the bar forward with new wins such as the one that you just talked about today. So maybe just frame out again where you see at least from what you have in the pipeline an end run rate of sales for BTM?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I wouldn't call it end run rate but we definitely look at -- if you look at the 2021 projection we put out there, we said we would be between $110 million and $130 million or so. And that's looking -- we're feeling pretty darn solid about that right now.\nScott Stember -- C.L. King and Associates -- Analyst\nGot it. That's all I have. Thanks.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Deem with Longbow. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Deem -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nGood morning.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Anthony.\nAnthony Deem -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nSorry if I missed this. What's the revenue growth at the lower end of your expectations, do you have a bias toward either the midpoint or lower end of the EBITDA margin range or maybe even the high end?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, we're still maintaining that range on EBITDA margin. We're feeling pretty confident about that right now.\nAnthony Deem -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nOK. So no bias toward lower or higher end?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nNo.\nAnthony Deem -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nIn the auto segment, how should we think about growth over market for the remainder of the year? Production using more realistic assumptions versus IHS, we said about declining about 1% the remainder of the year if you adjust for your regional mix. And that compares it down 4% in the first quarter, so this 4% growth rate maybe up to 7% over market even higher in the second half. Just wondering if this is sort of the type of framework you're using to reaffirm the guidance today.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I think -- we don't really use that. To be honest, we report that, but it's not like we're tied to that directly. There's so many unique things that happen in our business, as we talked about, roll-offs. For example, second quarter we see some roll -offs happening that are going to make second quarter a little more challenging than certainly the second half but we also have launches happening in the second half.\nSo it's definitely not -- you can't just peg us a certain percentage above or tied to IHS.\nAnthony Deem -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nImplied within the revenue guidance is a substantial increase in the growth over market in the back half of the year. So just --\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, yes.\nAnthony Deem -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nSo I think that's a fair way to look at it right?\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, definitely. I mean, certainly when you compare it that's true. But it's related to launches and specific events that are happening.\nAnthony Deem -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nOf course. Right. OK. And then just in general, how do you feel about your already and inflation you know maybe over the mid-term here in next couple of years you know a lot of innovation new business awards and maybe potentially some complex launches with new technologies.\nBTM, obviously, starting out a little bit lower margins because of low volumes. But just kind of wondering if you see a similar dynamic occurring over the next couple of years and maybe the rate of inflation RGNE. Thank you.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOn the R&D front, for sure, I've been pretty consistent. We're going to continue to invest strongly in our R&D. I think that's -- if I understand your question right. And even though we're delivering very significant results or gross savings on the fit-for-growth, we fully intend to keep funneling that back into our R&D resources, especially related to the focused growth areas.\nAnd on top of that, you made a great point, Anthony, that as we win awards, we have to develop those projects. And that's something you can't necessarily predict consistently. So example is the battery heating project. That's a brand new product.\nThat's going to take some some already resources to execute that. So given that, saying that, we still feel really strong about our our profitability guidance for the remainder of the year and our direction for 2021 very importantly.\nAnthony Deem -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. There are no further questions at this time I'd turn I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Eyler for closing comments.\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAll right. Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As I said in my opening comments,we remain focused on execution innovation and cost improvement.\nI'm confident that we'll deliver significant shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead and we certainly appreciate your interest and support and look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress. Thank you all and have a great day.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 49 minutes\nCall Participants:\nYijing Brentano -- Investor Relations and Corporate Communications\nPhil Eyler -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nMatteo Anversa -- Chief Financial Officer\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P.
