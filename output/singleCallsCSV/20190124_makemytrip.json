(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Vice President of Investor Relations, Jonathan Huang. You may begin.\nJonathan Huang -- Vice President-Investor Relations\nThank you.

During the last reported quarter, we continued to deliver on our twin objectives for the current fiscal year, which is to improve top line growth while reducing bottom line losses. We continue our relentless focus on delivering superior end-to-end experience for our customers. It's this unwavering focus on customers that has allowed the MakeMyTrip Group to strengthen its market share across all key travel segments quarter after quarter.\nI would now like to share some long-term macro growth drivers which the Group is well-placed to leverage for driving growth opportunities in 2019 and beyond. A recent Cisco report has forecasted that the number of smartphone users in India will reach 829 million by 2022, up from today's estimated 450 million users. Considering that mobile bookings account for almost two-thirds of our transactions we believe we have significant new customer acquisition opportunities ahead of us.\nThe Indian economy also continues to benefit with the stabilization of long-term reforms like demonetization, GST implementation, that is the goods and service tax, and focus on driving digital transactions. As a result, GDP growth is expected to be approximately 7.5% in calendar 2019, making India one of the fastest growing large economies globally. The overall demand for travel is also expected to remain robust as India is on track to become the third largest aviation market by 2022.\nEven with forecasted high growth rates, industry experts believe that the Indian aviation sector still remains relatively untapped. India now has over 100 operational airports with scheduled flights and this is projected to grow to over 200 airports over the next 20 years. While India's domestic air market continues to deliver double digit growth for the last several quarters the outbound air travelers growth projections are even more robust in the future.\nAdditionally, accommodation and intercity bus bookings are largely distributed offline today and remain a long-term growth driver for our business going forward. We believe that the MakeMyTrip Group is well positioned to innovate to make it super-convenient for all segments of Indian travelers to book online across our platforms.\nI'd now like to discuss our progress and achievements during this past holiday season. In Q3 we deployed various customer acquisition initiatives via creative and targeted campaigns, coupled with strong customer value propositions across all our brands to expand our reach. As a result, we saw about 30% year-on-year growth in overall searches as well as unique visitors across our various platforms and brands. Our customer base also grew by about 29% year-on-year to over 37 million transacted customers till date.\nIn Q3, our customer retention programs evolved to be more meaningful and rewarding for users. I'm pleased to share we now have close to 1 million enrollments in our MakeMyTrip Black program and over 57,000 in our subscription based MakeMyTrip Double Black loyalty program since inception. During the quarter, we launched a new variant of the Double Black program and has seen accelerated rate of enrollments as a result of the program changes. More encouraging is the fact that the quarter-on-quarter transactions per customer across both programs continue to rise and the overall repeat rate from these cohorts on the average are more than double of those of nonmembers.\nFor Goibibo users our goRewards program now has over 1.6 million registered users who are contributing and earning to make the platform experience even better. In fact, over 200,000 active daily enrolled users are contributing with user generated reviews and Q&A sessions which are -- which are relied upon by other shoppers.\nFurthermore, we are leveraging this program to crowdsource accurate information and content and elicit additional highly differentiated rich data often not provided by the retailers. Users are also sharing new travel attractions and activities near their own hometowns to provide other users more relevant data as they shop for hotels. Additionally, users are uploading their profile pictures to add more credibility on our platform, driving higher click-through rates and greater social connections. Lastly, our enrolled users are able to earn even more credits by leveraging their social networks to inform others of our innovative goRewards program. I'm happy to share that the program is driving very high engagement rates and we are seeing materially higher transactions per contributing customer over non-contributors.\nNow I'd like to move to discuss our continued tech investments which are aimed at making users' search results more relevant and improving their-post sales experience. During Q3, our team made more enhancements to MakeMyTrip's AI-based chatbot called Myra. Today Myra is available across all our platforms and is capable of handling over half of all customer use cases for post-sales support. The bot's coverage has expanded across all our lines of businesses and all major queries like date changes and cancellations. Our latest improvements has led to a tremendous reduction in users writing to us via email which would have otherwise required a large number of manual replies.\nAt Goibibo, our chatbot, Gia, has evolved further to handle over 10% of all bookings on Goibibo. Gia has also been upgraded to handle nearly half of all post-sales questions asked. Customers have indicated to us that they prefer using the chatbot for querying upcoming travel information, cancellation of trips booked or downloading the e-tickets. More importantly, repeat users of Gia have grown appreciably over the last few months, proving that AI-powered chatbots with timely human assistance is a great way to delight our customers, and we'll continue to invest in this area to offer a superior experience going forward.\nLastly, I'm pleased to share our foray into providing booking of local activities and experiences for our customers during the past quarter. With this launch, we want to enable users to plan weekend getaways, receive exciting dining offers, get an adrenaline shot of adventure and explore attractions within their home or destination cities. We believe this new business vertical will help us acquire incremental users and enhance usage frequency and stickiness on both the MakeMyTrip and Goibibo apps. Today, over 1,000 activities and experiences are offered across 30 cities to our customers over mobile apps.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rajesh.\nRajesh Magow -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer-India\nThanks, Deep, and Happy New Year, everyone.\nI would like to begin by sharing a summary of business performance highlights in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, which we believe were in line with our twin objectives, as mentioned by Deep. I'm pleased to report that the MakeMyTrip Group recorded gross bookings of over $1.4 billion, representing year-on-year constant currency growth of nearly 32%. Adjusted revenue grew over 31% year-on-year on constant currency basis and was largely in line with the gross bookings growth.\nDuring the past quarter, with the unstinted support of over 50,000 hotel partners, we also logged our highest ever quarterly room nights, with over 6.8 million stayed room nights in our stand-alone hotels business. This is a growth of 27% on a year-on-year basis. We are pleased with the continued acceleration in hotel room nights growth over the last few quarters, in line with our call-out during the beginning of the fiscal year.\nIn our air ticketing business, over 10.1 million flight segments were flown by our customers during the past quarter. The number of air ticketing segments grew by over 19% year-on-year. And at the same time, outbound flight segments growth was very robust as we continue to provide seamless booking experience to make it convenient to influence customers to book online on our platforms. Our bus ticketing business also witnessed very strong growth momentum, with over 16 million tickets traveled for the fiscal third quarter, representing more than 58% year-on-year increase. Lastly, our packages business continued to make valuable contributions to help record hotels and packages mix at 53% for the quarter.\nNow, I would like to share some highlights from our strategically important online stand-alone hotels business. In Q3, we continued to expand the selection for our customers to beyond 60,000 properties bookable within India, which includes 10,300 budget focused GoStays accommodations and over 14,500 alternative accommodations like guest houses, homestays and hostels.\nAs for our international outbound travelers, we also offer over 500,000 bookable properties, which includes directly contracted hotels in about 20 destinations where Indians like to travel. Equally important, we have also managed to provide bookings across the majority of those domestic-listed properties, highlighting the strength of our customer breadth and reach.\nFrom a user experience perspective, while we continue to release many new features across all our mobile platforms, we also introduced a new MakeMyTrip desktop site to deliver an even better experience to cater to high value premium domestic and international hotel customers who still continue to book on desktop. We also launched more features like last-booked hotel and displaying similar hotel to make it more personalized for our customers.\nIn addition, we have reworked the booking flow within our flights funnel to drive cross-sell opportunities for hotels and introduced new filters on the app to reduce search times by leveraging our robust hotel extranet. Our customers can also put in special requests prior to check-in or give hoteliers opportunities to respond in real-time to any customer feedback.\nLastly, as we've mentioned earlier, our hotels product also have the capabilities to sell experiences within hotels as -- and one-click add-on, giving us the ability to cross-sell more to users. As for users of our Goibibo platform, we launched hotels collections to attract distinct customer segments like business travelers, students and solo woman traveler. We've also further ramped up third-party quality checks to ensure consistency at GoStays properties and implemented better content, including higher quality images at each property, resulting in higher conversions.\nDuring the quarter, we have implemented vernacular communications with our suppliers to drive higher engagement and strengthen our business partnerships. We also released product features across all platforms to make the selection and booking experience of alternative accommodations better, which resulted in good traction on room nights growth in the segment. A newly launched widget, for instance, allows searches by a group with large number of guests on the app.\nFrom a host perspective, we have improved the extranet app to drive better usability as well as introduced a calendar sync feature with Google Calendar to allow one-click book -- blocking and unblocking of inventories. Going forward, we plan on further showcasing the value, use cases and amenities offered at these types of properties to drive further awareness to travelers and drive continuous improvements to the extranet for our hosts to drive better adoption and participations.\nNow I would like to share a few more details on our domestic air ticketing business. In fiscal Q3, we continued to see the moderation in growth of the domestic air market relative to several quarters of high growth rates in the recent past. I am pleased to share that despite the headwinds in the domestic market, we've been able to deliver higher than market growth rate, resulting in market share gains.\nIn addition, we are focused on driving up growth in international flight as the online penetration continues to be low in this segment. During the quarter, our international flight customers were provided free or low-cost multiple payment options for their long haul, high value target purchases, aiding in conversions.\nWe have also introduced the ability for customers to book multiple cities and flight legs all in one session. Customers also have the ability to choose from various airline combinations available during the same search session, giving them the best price combination possible for their international flights. Additionally, we've also enhanced our back end to make the experience and speed of ticket cancellations and refunds even better and faster for our users.\nLet me move on to share our Q3 achievements in the red (ph) business now --redBus business now. I'm pleased to share that in Q3 our redBus business hit a new peak of tickets booked and traveled in any single day in the brand's history.\nDuring the quarter our team expanded our customer reach into the South Indian bus market by launching a new mass media campaign which has resulted in new customer acquisitions from the region. We've also launched new value added services like travel insurance to help customers cover bus cancellations or bus changes.\nBefore I turn the call over to Mohit, I would like to share that the payments landscape in India is evolving rapidly and for the better with a directive from our government. We believe digitization of payments will bring online more e-commerce customers. We have also been working on upgrading our digital payments platform to build new capabilities, leveraging universal payments interface or UPI to serve our customers with new payment options.\nAs I briefly mentioned earlier, we are also piloting various equal monthly installment plans and extending credit to travelers by our third-party financial institutions to help facilitate large transaction value purchases. We are highly encouraged by the early results and believe this feature should help more customers be able to realize their travel and holiday expeditions going forward.\nNow let me hand it over to Mohit, who will share more details of the quarter.\nMohit Kabra -- Group Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Rajesh. Hello, everyone, and wish you a very happy 2019.\nAs mentioned by Deep and Rajesh, we are glad to report the acceleration in adjusted revenue growth to the 30s, aided by acceleration in stand-alone hotel room night growth to the high 20s in the current quarter. This comes along with reduction in adjusted operating losses to $22.2 million in the third quarter of this fiscal year. This is in line with our plans and the strategic direction called out at the beginning of the year.\nI am pleased to report that total adjusted revenue growth in constant currency terms, which stood at 25% for Q1 and 25.3% for Q2, has accelerated to 31.4% in Q3 which is the first quarter of the second half of this fiscal year. This was the result of an acceleration in adjusted revenue growth across all our lines of businesses.\nAdjusted revenue growth in constant currency for the air ticketing business stood at 32.2%, while it was 43.4% in the bus ticketing business. The hotels and packages business also saw adjusted revenue growth in constant currency, accelerating to 26%, compared to 19.8% in Q1 and 17.7% in Q2. The total adjusted revenue growth of 31.4% also came along with robust 37.2% growth in unit volumes and 31.9% constant currency growth in gross bookings across our businesses.\nNow let me share highlights of our key business segments. In the H&P segment, adjusted revenue in constant currency growth accelerated to 26% year-over-year, aided by acceleration in room nights growth which stood at 25.5%. The room nights growth was driven by improvement in stand-alone room nights growth which stood at 27.1% year-over-year. As a result of the increasing mix of the stand-alone hotels, which have lower average selling price compared to packages, the growth in hotels and packages gross bookings at 21.1% lags the 25.5% growth in H&P room night, while the margins were better at 23.7% compared to 22.8% in the same quarter last year.\nLet's now share some details of the air ticketing business where our growth continues to outpace the market growth. In Q3, our air ticketing segments count increased to over 10.1 million compared to 8.5 million in Q3 of the prior fiscal year, representing a growth of over 19%. The quarter's adjusted revenue of over $60.7 million was higher than the $50.9 million dollars reported in prior year's Q3 and reflected 32.2% growth on a year-on-year basis in constant currency terms.\nDuring this past quarter, our bus ticketing business also continued to grow robustly. Ticket unit growth stood at 58.3% with over 16 million bus tickets traveled during the quarter. The business achieved over $190 million in gross bookings and over $15 million in adjusted revenue during the quarter.\nIn Q3, the adjusted revenue from other businesses stood at about $8.6 million, the majority of which was driven by facilitation fee for travel insurance and ancillary revenue from our alliance and affiliate partnerships.\nMoving on to operating expenses. Marketing and promotional expenses at $146.7 million stood at about 10.4% of our gross bookings compared to 10.8% in the previous quarter and 11.2% in the same quarter last year. As a result of improved efficiencies in operating expenses and improvement in marketing and promotional expenses in particular, our adjusted operating losses were lower at about $22 million or 1.6% of gross bookings compared to 2% of gross bookings in the previous quarter and 2.86% of gross bookings in the same quarter last year.\nWith this, I would like to thank you all for joining the call and open up the call for Q&A. Operator, please.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nMAKEMYTRIP LIMITED (MMYT) Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript\n\n\nWhy MakeMyTrip Stock Fell Yesterday\n\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call Transcript\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Shyam Patil with SIG. You may proceed.\nBrendan Mance -- SIG -- Analyst\nHi, this is Brendan on for Shyam. We just had two quick ones. Just on the competitive landscape, I know marketing and promotion expense coming down as a percentage of gross bookings, but can you just talk about sort of what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape? Any changes? And then just on the outbound flights business, can you just talk a little bit more about your strategy there and sort of how you see that business shaping up over the next couple of years?\nDeep Kalra -- Founder, Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, hi, Brendan. I'll take the first one. This is Deep. So the first part, I think by line of business is the right way to look at competition. So on the air space, both domestic air and international air, we continue to see competition from erstwhile competitors Yatra and Cleartrip. In addition to that, Paytm which is a super-app, a multi-service app, is also now quite an active player on the domestic air space, not so much on the international. We also see some new players, Expedia, of course, as an international player, and we see some new players also who have emerged in that area. When it comes to the hotel space there is I would say lesser competition from erstwhile players. Definitely not Cleartrip. We see Yatra in the market for domestic bookings. We also see increasing competition from Booking.com and Expedia, both in the local market and of course in the inbound market. As you would know and you would have seen in the last few quarters, we've been talking about, so we are now selling OYO. OYO Rooms is now more of a hotel chain, and by virtue of them being a budget hotel chain, we've been partnering them and selling them. But they also have a strong direct business. So that is largely the competitive landscape. Of late, we have seen Paytm just enter on the hotel space as well, the business. But if you --if I take you back to the market shares you would see that the market share both for air and for hotel has been growing. So we believe we continue to grow significantly faster than the market, indeed faster than even the online market. So in air, the overall air market grew at about 12.7% this last quarter. We grew at about 18.5%. If we look at the hotel segment, data is a little harder to get. But we believe that the total penetration now on the hotel market is in the low teens, high double digits kind of -- 12% to 13% of all hotel bookings are made online and we account for about half of that.\nRajesh Magow -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer-India\nAnd maybe the second question -- this is Rajesh here -- on your outbound flights question, if I may just share my thoughts on that. So the first important point there is that the online penetration as compared to the domestic flight segment is quite low. So therefore we believe that the shift from offline to online will continue to happen and will gain momentum, more so when more and more people are coming online, more and more digital payments options are emerging, including the credit option as I kind of mentioned in my script as well, and the fact that the disposable income is growing. Lot of the people are looking to actually fly out for their holiday. And by virtue of all of these factors, actually the -- all the projections, the industry expert projections are also projecting the current outbound traveler number of say around 25 million to grow to about 50 million in the next few years. So the macros look good and we believe that we -- on our both platforms are very well poised to tap into this opportunity and grow our share. We already have higher growth rate albeit at a lower base on outbound flight segment but we believe that we will continue to keep kind of making all the interesting product (ph) level changes, the supply side innovations and be able to just keep the momentum of the growth going on our platforms as well.\nBrendan Mance -- SIG -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you, both.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Sachin Salgaonkar with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nSachin Salgaonkar -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nHi. Thank you for the opportunity. I have a few questions. Number one, just wanted to understand in terms of an EBIT breakeven target which you guys have talked in the past. I think you guys talked about eight quarters after the Ibibo acquisition where you guys should be close to EBITDA breakeven. Any updates on that? Are we still comfortable in terms of achieving that? That's the first question. Second question is, again, a related one. Last few quarters, the focus was more on a rationalization wherein you guys were curtailing discounts. Is that more or less period behind us? And going forward, could we see the growth accelerating? And third is, obviously, there are lot of chatter in the market about Jet Airways and how it is struggling. Would be great to understand how you guys look at it from a potential impact to, a, OT industry, and b, to you guys.\nMohit Kabra -- Group Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Sachin. Mohit here, and I'll take the first two and Deep and Rajesh would add on. So when it comes to -- and pretty much the first two are kind of linked. If you look at it, the whole rationale post the merger was to kind of start rationalizing promotions and spends particularly in the hotels category and more or so in the budget segment, which is what pretty much kind of played out pretty well over the last, I would say, eight quarters -- seven to eight quarters. And we believe we'll continue on that path till the time we at least get to breakeven, whether it takes another three quarters or four. But probably directionally this is where we're kind of treading. And if you would look at it over the last few quarters, even in the beginning of the fiscal year we had mentioned that we should see growth accelerating in the second half of the year and that's what I was calling out. So we have seen that acceleration come through in the first quarter of the second half, with revenue growth overall kind of again getting back into the 30s. If you look at the stand-alone hotel room nights growth that has also accelerated from the 17%, 18% and 21%, 22% in the last two quarters to about 27%-odd in the third quarter. And we therefore believe that a large part of the acceleration should kind of continue with the rationalization largely behind us. But, are we completely done with that? Probably not. And as we kind of keep going on that path for the next few quarters, we should probably be getting into EBITDA breakeven. If you look at it in terms of cash operating losses currently, even this quarter it's kind of less than $20 million. So we've covered a lot of ground over the last, I would say, six to seven quarters.\nRajesh Magow -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer-India\nOkay. Coming to -- Sachin, for the Jet Airways, and if you have a follow-up, we'll be happy to take that. So the first point on Jet Airways is that news -- I mean, lot of the news is already out which you always -- you kind of see every day pretty much, I mean, the development that happens on the Jet Airways. So that's I guess known to everyone, which is that Jet Airways is trying to raise funds and they're trying to look at many options, and the last update was that they -- that Etihad might be able to come to the rescue, et cetera. But just from our point of view, we've been able to continue to just monitor the situation very, very closely, work also very, very closely and been able to limit our exposure per se in terms of any outstanding from them and so on. So that part is, we're kind of comfortably placed. In terms of the thought that they would be able to come out of this situation, obviously, the -- I think it is better for the whole ecosystem that they come out of the situation, and seems like -- I mean, at least from the last update that we had it from them, and every now and then that we keep getting the update from them, that they seem to believe that they are confident to be able to find a solution in the next few weeks. So we are obviously watching this space very carefully and -- but, on the ground, kind of continue to keep working because on the ground there are no operations kind of disrupted and the flights are flying. I mean, they might be changing the schedules here and there, but a large part of the operations are still running and running well.\nSachin Salgaonkar -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay. Rajesh, this was helpful. So couple of small follow-ups generally from me. One is, Mohit, you talked about stand-alone hotels book growth accelerating at 27%. If you look at the revenue growth more or less we're talking about a 14% growth. Do we see that accelerating going forward also? And second is -- the question is, clearly, the sense I got is maybe up to four to five quarters or around that you guys will be close to EBITDA breakeven. But is it fair to assume that after that EBITDA breakeven, the EBITDA margins start accelerating further up or more or less we could be stagnant at the EBITDA level for some time?\nMohit Kabra -- Group Chief Financial Officer\nSo, Sachin, if you -- first thing on the hotels and packages revenue growth, while probably the dollar revenue growth is about 14%, but it's better to kind of look at it in constant currency because it's all INR, and therefore currency fluctuation. And if you look at constant currency growth, that's close to about 26%. And we have been calling out that we have largely been kind of -- the mix as I called out has been accelerating in favor of hotels and therefore it is likely that the hotels growth is going to be leading that number as well. So therefore I think the growth overall is kind of coming in line, whether in terms of room night growth or revenue growth. And that isn't an issue per se. And this is more a presentation issue in terms of dollars versus the local currency. In terms of the acceleration in EBITDA as and when we get to the breakeven levels, as I said, this is probably something we're talking about at least about a year down the line and I'm sure we'll kind of continue giving more and more color as we keep getting there. So hopefully in the next few quarters, we should be able to share more color on how do we kind of take it further from there.\nSachin Salgaonkar -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay, all right. Thanks.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. You may proceed.\nKevin Campbell Kopelman -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nHi, thanks a lot. I was going to ask you an update on revenue take rates or commission rates. It looks like they were stable -- relatively stable in air and up a little bit in hotel and down in bus. Could you talk about the key drivers in each category and how you see those playing out over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.\nMohit Kabra -- Group Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sure. You know, if you look at it, the air take rates have been reasonably stable compared to the last couple quarters. So -- and we don't really kind of see a significant change directionally over the next few quarters and few years. We do believe that air take rates will come down gradually, and this is going to happen on multiple counts. But we also believe that in terms of a corresponding change, we will have our payment gateway costs also kind of coming down. And therefore at a net level probably it should not hurt us in a big way even in the next few years. When it comes to hotels and packages, while there is a year-on-year kind of a slight increase but probably more driven by the changing mix in favor of hotels in the overall segment rather than anything else. So it's not really that from a supply side point of view we have increased margins. We have only been actually taking the overall margins in the hotel segment probably down by about 0.5 percentage point to 1 percentage point over the last quarter operating margin (ph) on a quarter-on-quarter basis. We are trying to kind of see that we gradually over the next few years get back probably more in the range of about 18% to 20% rather than the 20% plus range. But I guess this will happen more gradually and over the next few years. So -- otherwise, the overall take rates have been reasonably stable and the relief that we kind of are talking about of are taking down margins over the next few years. Again, it's predominantly kind of linked to our overall rationalization of the marketing and promotional expense because as we've called out it is largely the suppliers who kind of participate with incremental performance linked incentives so as to drive higher occupancy rates for them. So this is -- this is more a volume driver for them and we believe that over a period of time, as our promotional expense keep going down, we should be able to kind of pass on that benefit to the suppliers. On the bus side, pretty much the retail margins kind of continue to remain stable. It's just a little bit of incremental mix coming in from the -- from the B2B side, considering the investments that we have done in the recent past in that area, that the overall weighted margins kind of have come down slightly over the last quarter. But otherwise, the margins remain stable even in the bus segment.\nKevin Campbell Kopelman -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks very much.\nOperator\nThank you.
