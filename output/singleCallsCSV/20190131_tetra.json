(Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Batrack please go ahead Mr. Backtrack.\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nThank you very much Regina and good morning and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call and I'm very glad to report the results of how we began our 2019 fiscal year.\nTetra Tech achieved its best first quarter in the company's history with record first quarter net revenue income and adjusted earnings per share. Another quarter of strong orders across our business also drove our backlog to new record high at $2.79 billion that's up 15% from last year.\nWith this increased visibility across a very diverse client base we see significant opportunities for Tetra Tech's growth in fiscal year 2019 and beyond. I'll now provide an overview of our quarterly results and business outlook while Steve Burdick our Chief Financial Officer will provide additional details in our financial performance and our capital allocation.\nWe had an excellent first quarter achieving record highs for Q1 net revenue operating income and adjusted earnings per share. For our first quarter our revenue was $717 million. Our net revenue was $553 million which generated an operating income of $56 million which is up 12% from last year.\nThat resulted in diluted earnings per share from operations of $0.70 for the quarter up 8% from the prior year. And finally backlog was up 15% year-over-year at $2.79 billion the highest in the over 50-year history of the company.\nI'd now like to provide an overview of our performance by each of our end client customers. Our record first quarter performance was led by strong growth for international work and continued growth in our U.S. municipal water and U.S. commercial environmental programs.\nOur international net revenue was up 23% for the quarter year-over-year. International growth was supported by our sustainable infrastructure design work and resource management practices including significant increases in our revenue from Western Canada which has been a bit slower in previous quarters.\nOur U.S. commercial net revenue was up slightly also at just approximately at about 1%. In the United States this growth was primarily due to environmental work for commercial clients as well as services in the energy and oil and gas sectors.\nOur state and local revenues for the quarter were 17% of our business down 5% collectively due to year-on-year comparisons with the record high disaster recovery revenues that we had in the prior year.\nHowever our state and local water infrastructure services continued to be very strong with double-digit growth driven by our water projects in the areas of California Texas and Florida. Work for our U.S. federal clients was 28% of our net revenue in the quarter.\nOn a collective basis we to budget uncertainties and the lead up to the partial government shutdown that began late in December, I'd now like to present our performance by our business segments.\nThis quarter we had strong performance by both of our business groups driving up overall margin and performance for the quarter. The GSG our government services business group delivered another strong quarter with a margin of 12.3%.\nNote that a year ago the GSG group was responding to three simultaneous hurricane recovery efforts in the United States. Those were Hurricane Harvey Irma Maria and even worked out in California a year ago.\nIt was really a high point for our GSG business group. The GSG group over the past year had strong growth across our federal and state and local markets resulting in a consistent margin performance with only a very slight decline in the year-on-year comparisons for just this first quarter.\nFor the first quarter I'm actually very pleased to report that our commercial and international business groups net revenue grew by 13% while their margin increased by 180 basis points from last year to a 10.9% margin.\nAnd that's particularly high given it's the holiday season here in the U.S. in really most of our operations.\nThe CIG group revenue and margin expansion was driven by their infrastructure work in Australia infrastructure and industrial work in Canada and commercial and environmental programs in the United States.\nOur total backlog as we completed the first quarter is at $27,93,000,000 an all-time record high up 15% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially from where we closed at the end of last fiscal year.\nAs you can see on our slide if you're following along with simulcast our first quarter had orders that were broadly distributed across both our commercial and our government clients worldwide.\nNotably in the quarter we were rewarded task orders to perform international development services support U.S. Army programs and execute environmental programs for commercial clients.\nWe were also awarded over $200 million in disaster response tasks given us extraordinary visibility which has allowed us to increase our forecast for state and local work for the remainder of the year.\nNow I would like to turn the presentation over to Steve Burdick our Chief Financial Officer to present the details of our financials for the first quarter of 2019.\nSteve?\nSteven M. Burdick -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Dan. So as Dan just highlighted net revenue operating income and EPS for the first quarter 2019 were quite strong. And in fact are each Tetra Tech records for a first quarter. The fiscal 2019 first quarter revenue was $717 million compared to the revenue of $760 million in the first quarter fiscal 2018.\nThe difference is due to lower subcontracting activity as a result of less disaster response projects in the first quarter of 2019 compared to last year where we had multiple hurricanes. In addition the lower revenue reflects 2018 third quarter divestiture of our field services operations.\nNow the fiscal 2019 first quarter net revenue of $553 million decreased when compared to the net revenue of $545 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase resulted from both our environmental consulting work as well as our international sustainable infrastructure efforts which are part of our CIG group.\nAnd similar to the impact our divestiture had on total revenue without this divestiture our net revenue would have increased by about 4% year-over-year. We also saw a healthy 15% increase in operating income year-over-year from $49 million to $56 million.\nThe uptick in operating income and EBITDA were due to the improvement in margins at our CIG group, the CIG operating income increased by over 25% resulting in margins improving from 9.1% in the prior year to 10.9% in the current quarter.\nThese improvements as Dan discussed were primarily driven by Western Canada and the growing net revenues mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis our EPS was $0.75. Excluding the 2017 tax law impacts our adjusted EPS of $0.77 per share this year is up 8% over the $0.65 last year primarily due to the increase in our operating income.\nNow our GAAP results for the prior year earnings per share included about $0.17 per share tax benefit due to the tax law impact on our deferred taxes.\nWe completed that deferred tax assessment for this new tax law in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and recognized a non-recurring $0.05 per share tax benefit. For the first quarter cash flow used in operations totaled $15 million.\nThis compares favorably to the prior year cash usage of $58 million which is an improvement of about $43 million. The first quarter is typically a seasonal cash user. And as such the negative cash was expected but so far today we are ahead of our operating cash plan for fiscal 2019.\nOur net debt totaled $192 million and resulted in a leverage ratio of about 0.8 times. Lastly, our day sale outstanding was 83 days for the first quarter. This is an improvement of two days from last year and our target for DSO is 75 days or less which we continue to work toward.\nNow going to our capital allocation strategy, our strategy calls for a balance of divesting in the growth of our business managing the balance sheet and returning cash to our shareholders. And our continued strong annualized operating cash flows allow us to continue to do just that.\nWe paid out $6.7 million in dividends for the first quarter. And just this week our Board of Directors approved our 20th consecutive dividend which will be paid out in February at a rate of $0.12 per share.\nSo delivering significant returns for our shareholders remains a key part of our balanced capital allocation strategy. And as such in the first quarter we exhausted the previous $200 million stock buyback initiated two years ago with a buyback of $25 million.\nAnd going forward we will continue to utilize the current $200 million stock buyback program that was just implemented. I am very pleased to share these outstanding financial results for the quarter and I want to thank you for your time today.\nI'll now hand the call back over to Dan.\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nGreat, thank you very much Steve. As we enter the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 we see our growth being supported by positive trends across all four of our client sectors. In fiscal year 2019 we expect a 10% growth rate with our international clients in Canada and Asia Pacific region.\nThis growth will be driven by our sustainable building design services and in industrial consulting and engineering work. Our United States state and local work is also expected to grow at a 10% rate supported by a combination of municipal water and disaster response recovery services.\nThis demand continues to be quite high for our differentiated services in the state and local markets and we're very well-positioned through more than 250 offices here in the United States with hundreds of contracts with key cities and municipalities that comprised this market for us.\nOur U.S. commercial work is expected to grow at a 5% rate with a combination of growth in the industrial water treatment environmental cleanup programs energy and solid waste.\nWe expect our U.S. federal work to be almost 1/3 of our business and grow in 2019 even considering the impact of the longest government shutdown in United States history. The shutdown did cause us to lower our federal growth rate from 5% to 2% for the full year and I'll speak about those impacts here next.\nI would like to provide some details and a brief update on the recently completed partial government shut down and its impact on Tetra Tech's business including that has caused us to adjust our growth rate to 2% for the entire fiscal year.\nOur U.S. federal work is typically about 1/4 of our business. In the first quarter the U.S. federal was 28% of our business to be precised.\nAnd that's referring to net revenue. We work for a numerous federal agencies and we typically think of the work being distributed in three approximately equal components or portions.\nFirst, the Department of Defense is about 1/3 of our federal work; second international development is about 1/3 of our work and third the civilian agencies which include the Environmental Protection Agency the Federal Aviation Administration and other civil agencies comprised the final 1/3.\nFor the quarter the Department of Defense budgets have been approved earlier in 2019 so we saw no impact in the first quarter and we really expect to do nothing in the second quarter from budget shortfalls are spending with first component of our federal work.\nThe second area international development which includes the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development does not have an approved budget for fiscal year 2019. So it was part of the partial government shutdown.\nHowever our projects were relatively unaffected since they're operating on previously funded awards.\nNow for the third category for civilian agencies which include the United States Environmental Protection Agency the Federal Aviation Administration National Science Foundation and others we did see an immediate impact with approximately 15% of our projects put on a hold for the partial government shutdown.\nWe did see this deepen as the shutdown extended and our clients' contingency funds were depleted. Now we did see some impact prior to the shutdown in December due to the uncertainty in the budgets for the affected agencies.\nAnd we expect to see some overhang here in the second quarter and here at the beginning of February as agencies restart their programs and catch up on procurement and contract awards that were actually set aside while the government will shut down.\nAnd we have estimated the impact and we do estimate that the impact of the partial government shutdown in the second quarter to be about $15 million in revenue which has associated earnings of about 2% -- $0.02 impact to our earnings for the second quarter.\nDuring the quarter we saw continued strength in a wide range of services especially those related to sustainability. In fact these services were remarkably unaffected by the U.S. budgetary disputes that I just referred to and further demonstrates the resilience of our diversified mix of business.\nI'd like to highlight three major areas that exemplify our differentiated business model and growth opportunities for the remainder of the year. Water infrastructure programs continue to be very strong for us primarily led by services for the high-growth regions of Texas California and Florida that I mentioned earlier.\nWe provide sustainable water management design services that help our clients secure reliable water supplies prepare for droughts and strengthen the resilience of their infrastructure when extreme events like hurricanes and big storms do occur.\nOur sustainable buildings practice now leverages the global capabilities of a $200 million business to provide our clients with high-end designs.\nOur teams are working on building designs that are first of the kind buildings that generate more power than they use buildings that capture and recycle water and buildings that create a more functional and healthy workspace than it existed before. And finally, our disaster response and recovery business continues to evolve.\nAddressing the cumulative demand to address both new disasters and long-term recovery needs for those that have occurred in the past several years we maintained over 400 contracts with local clients and continue to enhance our proprietary software to deliver the highest quality services across all types of disasters.\nSustainability-related services are very well aligned with Tetra Tech including our focus on water and environment our commitment to forward-looking solutions and our Leading with Science approach to problem-solving.\nI'd now like to present our guidance for the second quarter and for all of fiscal year 2019. Our guidance is as follows. For the second quarter our net revenue guidance range is from $520 million to $570 million with -- an associated diluted earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.66.\nFor the entire year we reiterate our net revenue guidance range of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion and that is associated with -- a diluted earnings per share -- and it would be an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.80 to $2.95.\nhis does not include the 5% benefit that we just realized in the first quarter from the tax benefit from the earlier tax law or this number would be higher. There are a number of assumptions included in this guidance range.\nIt does include a noncash intangible amortization for the year of approximately $9 million which represents $0.12 per share. We do assume that we'll be at a 26% effective tax rate for the year. It assumes 56 million average diluted shares outstanding and it does exclude contributions from future acquisitions.\nAnd as I mentioned this does not include a 5% contribution from the onetime nonrecurring tax benefit that we saw here in the first quarter. In summary we had an excellent first quarter and a great start to 2019 with record revenue income and adjusted earnings per share.\nOur backlog reached an all-time high driven by orders across a broad base of our business. Our focus on high-end estate ability services and water and environment is resulting in increased opportunities in fiscal year 2019 and new markets that we've never even seen orders from before.\nAnd in closing I'm very pleased with how we began this fiscal year. Our resilient and flexible business model focus on high-end consulting services provides us excellent opportunities consistent demand from our clients and a proven ability to navigate changes in the market.\nAnd with that Regina, I'd now like to open the call for questions.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nShould Stantec Inc.'s Weaknesses Concern You?\n\n\nPentagon Awards 10 Navy Contracts Thursday\n\n\nWhy Tetra Tech Shares Tanked\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.\nRyan Connors -- Boenning & Scattergood -- Analyst\nI wanted to actually probe on the government shutdown just a little bit first and ask whether those issues have had any impact on competitive dynamics.\nAnd I guess what I mean by that is even though the impact on your clients was minimal aside from the civilian agencies is there any sign that other competitors are shifting resources into your markets as a result of some of the other federal markets that were impacted?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nWe have not seen that. We've not seen it. There was none of the work that we had was either up for recompetes or actually had any flexibility with respect to moving people into the market, while 35 days if you're not working it seemed like an eternity.\nThe procurement cycle and the preparation and positioning for work in these other markets is often many, many quarters if not a few years in preparation to prepare for servicing and responding to these activities.\nSo the impact to us was really having people go home on existing work that we were in plays on. And those that were not affected were really long-term contracts that are typically multiyear. So this 35-day shutdown has not at least we've seen at this point changed any competitive dynamic by bringing new people into the market.\nIf anything what we've heard is individuals called us if we have subcontract work for them with our state and local and commercial work to look how they could actually leave servicing the federal government.\nBecause they're highly concentrated in the components that were impacted we do feel quite fortunate that the impact of the company is quite modest. But for those that are much more concentrated than those that were impacted it could be just the side of catastrophic.\nRyan Connors -- Boenning & Scattergood -- Analyst\nOkay. Interesting, my next question was on energy. You didn't mention energy much. Obviously a couple of years ago we did have the issue with Canada when the last time energy prices kind of rolled over. So can you just reset us on that business with energy prices down again? And whether there's -- what the risk profile looks like there?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes. That's a great question. When we talk about energy at least one aspect for it, for us energy is actually more and more has been evolving to renewable energy wind solar geothermal other items.\nBut certainly when you're talking about oil and gas theory that was most acutely impact was the Canadian oil and gas for obvious reasons higher production cost in the oil sands. It was quite a challenge or a headwind in 2018.\nWe have seen that abate. And part of the reason for the increase in the margin is the really financial challenges we had in 2018 really abated. We have seen work picked up. We've seen it being steady and we've seen the steady increase in the United States a bit more in Western Canada Alberta and the oil sands.\nWe have said that to the work head adjusted enough that it was a 80% of our oil and gas work was in the U.S. and Canada had pulled back to about 20. U.S. has continued to grow but Canada actually has turned around and released with a bit more work both in engineering and on turnkey work.\nAnd again I'm speaking mostly for Tetra Tech about midstream or pipelines work. So pump stations right away clearance compressor stations this type of work. And that actually has been strengthening across both Canada and the U.S. But because it was such a low point strength in Canada which he saw the results help contribute to the performance of CIG.\nWe have seen in the mix move to more of a 70/30 because of the impact in Canada with the U.S. being 70 and 30 and we're working off of about $100 million basis last year and we think that number might go up to somewhere between 100 and 150 this year.\nStill a little bit early. But I would say it's a positive contributor. But I certainly wouldn't -- we didn't highlight it because it wasn't a big needle mover because it's on a small base now. And it's actually driving the company but it's actually not something that holding us back for this quarter.\nRyan Connors -- Boenning & Scattergood -- Analyst\nGot it, I do have one last one. And I know it's a sense of topic and it's probably not too much you can say. But you continue to get your name dragged through the mud pretty unfairly and some of these getting pretty unbalanced press reports on this Hunter point story.\nAnd those articles are kind of making their rounds out there in the investment community. So I just want to give you the opportunity to make any comments that you can about that situation. And how we should all be thinking about that?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nWell. We are highly aware of what we think are completeness representations in the media. And the characterization of what transpired we take all legal matters very seriously in this particular instance.\nUnfortunately are such a dream Tetra Tech EC did have two low-level individuals in this organization will behaved criminally about eight years ago and violated the high ethical standards of this organization and the organization of Tetra Tech EC. The wrongdoing was immediately addressed back at that time.\nAnd this is 2011 and 2012 by Tetra Tech EC with our client's oversight and input we did complete at that time an extensive investigation and up limitation of corrective actions all of which were summarized in a public report that was submitted to all agencies reviewed and approved at that time including with our clients.\nThere is now a civil legal process which in some ways is actually beneficial because perhaps we can move away from this unsubstantiated a media publication that is not grounded in reality or fact in any manner.\nAnd Tetra Tech EC will vigorously defend its record and its confident of the prevail following an impartial and transparent legal process and scientific review of the actual facts and not this fabrication.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.\nTahira Afzal -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nDan congrats to you and your team on a good quarter.\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nThank you, Tahira.\nTahira Afzal -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nIt seems like the world is becoming more subject to extreme weather. And I know your state and local outlook was based on that this year. But is there sustainability to it when you talk across with your clients?\nAnd I know you do a lot of extensive studies. Do you think this will be unfortunately an ongoing source of revenues for you going forward?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nThat's a good question. In previous quarters certainly most of the quarters for 2018 we actually had a slide in a bit more detail this in our disaster response and recovery.\nThe one area that we wanted to highlight previously and I'm glad you asked this question it gives me a chance to note this.\nThat we really are following our clients not just from the response activity which is doing the very initial evaluation of what happened and the hazardous issues that exist with respect to the fires and the debris or the water that's come out of wastewater treatment plants and immediate response between one month and one year.\nBut we're moving more and more into the assessments of the overall impact of these disasters in the long term planning for a recovery. And we think that's more like a 2-to5-year program. And the overall size of that is much larger.\nWe've had a number of successes where we've actually followed our clients not just from the initial response but also to the planning and recovery. And that's actually making up a bigger and bigger part of the disaster recovery work.\nAnd then of course beyond that there's actual implementation of the planned work which is the detailed design and the oversight and the insurance of the final construction of levees and dams and dikes and water facilities at higher levels and actually even new types of treatment facilities or infrastructure is typically a 10-year process.\nIn fact that's about how long we worked in Katrina in the New Orleans area. We were there for about -- between 10 and 15 -- 10-plus years. So we do saying it'd be much, much more, longer tail, actually larger and bringing more of the resources within the company.\nBut let me just say one word about this is being episodic. No doubt you have a hurricane and it's something that's a big impact and it's a disaster. And we do need to take it extremely serious. In the 1980 s it was thought off when -- once every 10 years.\nIn the '90s maybe it was a twice or 3 times in 10 years, while sitting here in the last few years the big events in 2015. 2016 there were more. 2017 there were more. 2018 it was a record. And of course we've just had the largest fire and the largest financially measured disaster with the California fires in the world is last year.\nSo what was considered a single episodic event that would not, never happen again is becoming more a reoccurring event. So I wouldn't -- it is moving to can you plan it on a calendar? No. But can you anticipate that there may be some during the year?\nIt certainly appears to be the case. And so we're building on our one-of-a-kind best in the industry technology that we brought to the marketplace.\nIt makes us physically more competitive and it actually brings a better work product and a faster turnaround for our clients so they can actually get the residents and citizens and communities back to where they were before quicker than ever.\nSo for those reasons we think we're going to fair very well for the upfront work. But staying with the programs all the way through completion we think is actually building to be a fabric of the company revenue stream.\nIt's not just what we do after the recovery it's what we do we do planning and the long-term work.\nTahira Afzal -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nIt seems typically if you go back 10 years you had some cyclicality in state and local business that budgets and what have you?\nBut it seems this time things are little different just because the result of this work going on in there could be a longer deal on how to cyclicality of the economy in the U.S. believes?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nThat's true. I do want to point out one item that when we began 2019 fiscal year 2019 on this call three months ago our forecast was a 5% growth in our state and local business which was anticipated some headwind from the nonrecurring work that had happened a year ago with Harvey.\nBut we did book over $200 million in disaster response and recovery work in the quarter. And while we had many things that we felt were very favorable at a very good quarter perhaps that was the one standout that we think give us a lot more confidence.\nAnd that was caused us to double the growth rate for state and local market for the entire year. And we think that's all embodied in SKUs two, three and four.\nTahira Afzal -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGot it, OK. And then just as a follow-up on margins. I know you talked about it. You made some niche acquisitions earlier on. Do you feel that business is now starting to gain traction? And that's an area for M&A focus for you? Or do you still at a point making grow that organically now?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nThe infrastructure design business we think -- so we would refer to it internally as our high-performance building practice. We have -- at the eastern seaboard of the U. S. well positioned we have client's relationships staff.\nWe're on the West Coast from Vancouver British Columbia all the way down to San Diego. We have a best-in-class globally Australian platform that we can utilize. We do think that we could add something in Europe.\nAnd we do have an office in the presence with just under 100 people. But a lot of that is then offshore to the U.S. Australia and other areas. But we do think we could add an acquisition there.\nBut the rest of it should be an organic growth rate focus and it is among the highest margin business we have in the company. So it's getting to the scale that it actually can impact the overall margin of the corporation as it continues to grow top line.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Tate Sullivan with Maxim Group.\nTate Sullivan -- Maxim Group -- Analyst\nYou gave good detail earlier on international net revenue growth partly coming from Canada. But where there other areas that contributes? I think you pointed out 23% year-over-year international growth?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes. In Western Canada and while I commented pick up on the oil and gas work midstream in Western Canada that was only a component of it. It was not isolated to that. We also saw municipal infrastructure work. That's water supply water treatment.\nBut we saw actually a little bit of a pick-up in some of the mining activity in the industrial side in Western Canada. So while I do note oil and gas only because it was a bit of an it's a matter of fact significant had been a year ago.\nIt's contributing now. But its other areas were equally strong in Western Canada. So I would say is really broad-based strength in Canada. Dissent helped on the top line. I would also say that we have seen top line growth in our infrastructure work primarily high-performance building practice in Australia and the Asia Pacific Oregon region.\nSo we do have multinational clients that have taken us to some of the Asian countries. Places like Hong Kong the Philippines and other areas where we're doing design work. But is primarily being done out of her Asia Pacific Center of Excellence out of Melbourne.\nSo that -- the revenue growth and Dennis I spoken earlier about the presentation and the question earlier. The abatement of the headwinds or the cost that were embedded for our oil and gas in Canada is actually moderated.\nSo would help contribute to margins and then just high-performance buildings practice at a higher margin business contributed to the significant increase in margin in CIG group.\nTate Sullivan -- Maxim Group -- Analyst\nI know that Hyatt is sustainable building just a point of clarification, when you talk about that. When you talk about environmental work for commercial clients, is that the same as international sustainable infrastructure work or is that different?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nThat's different. So when we will talk about sustainable infrastructure work we're primarily talking about high-performance buildings.\nAnd we're moving more and more from lead platinum build dams gold buildings platinum buildings all the way up to the highest designation which is not only a net zero.\nBut we're actually moving to a net positive whereas I mentioned buildings were actually producing more energy producing more water under kind of wonder how you actually produce how to produce more water.\nWe actually have buildings designed to capture water systems from rain. So it actually goes into reservoirs. They're served as cooling chambers. So he actually decreases energy use. So it's really an all-encompassing upgrading for existing buildings.\nIf it's a renovation or for green fields or new construction we're actually leading most of the high-end buildings for a number of our clients around the world, so high end when we say sustainable infrastructure is primarily those buildings.\nIn environmental work is actually assessing impacts to legacy operations as to impacts to air for air emissions soil for any discharges. And of course groundwater surface water lakes and.\nSo its environmental assessment and cleanup work including evaluation of new emerging chemicals to go back and evaluate sites that even been cleaned up earlier. So that's really two different items not simply restating the same end markets.\nTate Sullivan -- Maxim Group -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you answered question you mentioned about $200 million in sustainable buildings. So that's about 9% at least of my net revenue forecast for 2019. So it's not all. Is not linked directly to the new built construction you do retrofit existing buildings as well. Is that correct?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes. That's correct. And actually the division of that or the partitioning of that is about 50-50 It's about 50% rehabilitation renovation of existing buildings. And the other half is actually new construction for first of kind facilities so it is both.\nTate Sullivan -- Maxim Group -- Analyst\nOkay great. And just one last one for me, you mentioned permanent related work for new renewable energy spreads? Or what is that exactly?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes. It's also permitting. Is also the assessment work, we've done more offshore we've done more permitting work both for sliding permitting and impact evaluation for the offshore Marine wind generation market.\nI believe the all other entities combined. Tetra Tech has done the majority of the environmental upfront evaluation permitting work evaluation of environmental impacts. All of that work more than all others combined.\nAnd there have been a few announcements where individuals ask this one you haven't gotten. And it's because we've done all of the adjacent facilities and there's actually a conflict created because we monopolize that entire area with respect to the data collection in that area.\nSo that's what I'm referring to with renewable energy market and the type of work we do there.\nOperator\nYou're next question comes from the line of Andrew Whitman with Baird.\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nI guess I wanted to just dig into the guidance a little bit more. Summarized kind of what I see here. Looks like basically the top line you had the government shutdown to the negative better disaster restoration as exemplified by the backlog that you called down to kind of offsetting that.\nThat gives revenue in line. You beat the expectation you be the guide on margins. And I guess I haven't heard anything here today to suggest that the margin -- if there's anything particularly unusual in the guidance.\nSo when I look at it kind of feels like given that you beat the quarter you raised the guidance actually not quite as much. It just kind of feel outlook for the margin for the balance of the year are not changed from your initial guidance despite the beat in this quarter.\nI guess I wanted to get some help reconciling that. And is that a level of conservatism in the EPS guidance? Or is there some sort of change that you're expecting to happen?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nNo. It's a good observation Andy. No doubt about it. We did increase our EPS earnings per share guidance by raising the lower end by $0.05. There are certainly some discussion here about raising it more or raising both the bottom and the top including perhaps even at a greater number given the beat in Q1 and our guidance for Q2.\nThe item that you could say is conservative is appropriately cautious is that when we release our guidance yesterday we completed the documents are prepared to release. The government has just been turned back on for 48 hours two days. And coming off of a 35-day shutdown I thought it would be prudent to actually work through Q2 and actually see what the actual impacts are to both the top and potentially the bottom line.\nAnd it seemed that with such an immediate proximity to being turned on to actually sort of go all in as if it had never happened before. It was certainly possible but it had to be prudent we would be modest are appropriate with respect to the EPS increase. And that will love to give you more clarity and update that in a call just 90 days from now.\nWe have a great ins that would naturally know overall impact to Tetra Tech was in debt to keep year but there's no -- clear. There's no issue that we see out in the remainder of the year in any of our other end markets that would lead us to adjust downward or otherwise be more conservative with the performance we expect in the year.\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nOkay. That's helpful color. I guess the only other thing here you guys give cash flow targets and I guess there isn't one now. I was wondering you said you're above planned versus last year. Last year had a lot of working capital consumed because of the disaster restoration work which is known the government always leverages their providers balance sheets a little bit.\nSo it's good that it's better. You said you're on track you said you're actually about planned. I guess the question is what's planned for cash flow?\nSteven M. Burdick -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I would say that our plan every year is to generate more cash flow from operations as compared to our net income. And so we did that the last couple of years and that's our goal this year. As our net income will increase this year we expect our cash flow from operations to also increase.\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nAnd maybe if you could just keep going a little bit more you guys had a DSO target out there. Still kind of hearing the low 80s rather than the targeting the 70s, the RCM project had been one of the main reasons.\nThat one of this income statement is not much of a factor. But how much of RCM is affecting the DSO level? And is there an opportunity as the year progresses you think we start getting closer to the DSO target?\nSteven M. Burdick -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think -- as you pointed out RCM has become very minimal in terms of any revenue or basically break even. And the one thing that we do need to do to wrap up the RCM operations is to get the claims resolved. We hope to get those results quicker than longer term.\nBut as we do resolve those we don't expect to spend more cash we expect to be able to collect on those receivables which will have a positive impact both on our DSO and on our cash flow from operations.\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nCan you refresh all of us opportunity for the claim?\nSteven M. Burdick -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYes. It's probably couple days DSO probably 5 six days. Something like that. And so it's it could be quite beneficial as we get those results.\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nGot it, is that the goal for the year just to get that may be resolved this year? Are there any DSO opportunities that you're seeing this year on the rest of the DSO? Is there a target for another couple of days on top of the five or six basically what your target is?\nSteven M. Burdick -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nWe're always targeting to be at our than what we've done in the past. That is the goal and that's what we're working toward.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel.\nNoelle Dilts -- Stifel, Nicolaus -- Analyst\nSo my first question. You touched on margins a bit in the Q&A session. But could you help us just to understand how you're kind of think about margins for each segment for the year. You definitely had a pretty strong GSG margin in 2018.\nI think you came in for the year at about 13.9%. Is that a number you think you can beat in 2019. And then if you just touch on how you think about margins over the long term and kind of your target for GSG and CIG?\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nAbsolutely, so we did have a very good year last year at 13.9% for GSG. I think that number was really driven by exceptional performance in the fourth quarter. In fact it was a high-value market high watermark for GSG.\nIt's probably the right metaphor giving a lot of water where. But at 16.33% in the fourth quarter really drove that number up there. We always felt that if it performed a Welk well that is an overall mix.\nOur government services business could be between a 13% and 15% margin on an annual basis. So we were right in the middle. I think we can achieve that number where we did last year. What did of course it was in the fourth quarter. It was in higher margin work.\nIt was higher volume work which actually increased utilization which then translated to the bottom line that drove that number hi. I wouldn't say that 16-plus % for a given quarter is something that's easily achieved, it certainly possible.\nBut if you were even in the 15% range maybe a little bit better in the fourth quarter and we'd be quite pleased year. So if we keep the volume up we should be able to be very close to what the overall margin was last year.\nSo again the longer-term goal 13% to 15% volume is quite high we can think we could beat that 50%. We were roughly a 39%. So we have another 110-basis-point that we could probably add to that business of things are relatively optimal. So the wrist upside there, CIG there's actually significant upside.\nLast year we were at 8.7%. You can see we started out of the gate this year at just under 11%. We do think that if the work has run well and the economy is strong and there is some commodities were dear with respect to mining work and oil and gas another energy resource work that number should be able to match or beat the government services margins.\nSo we think that a year recovery last year at 8.7. Our goal would be to get a closer to 11% this year. So significantly close the gap with GSG. We do think it I would hope that may be an optimal quarter they could manage on a given quarter and actually beat GSG and may be late this year as things begin to pick up perhaps in some of these end markets.\nAnd our longer-term goal would be that in a down market with a lot of headwinds we would see that out of much wider range. There could be at a 10% or below which is what you saw last year. We think and what would be a solid year with plenty of work flow there should be closer to 15%.\nAnd then may be 14% to 15% so a bit higher than the GSG in a very robust market the number should be between 15% and 20%. So on a challenging market there'll be a fair amount a bit below. And a strong market they'll be above.\nAnd I think that with respect to this year we're looking for them probably not to match the GSG margin in aggregate. But we think it will be much closer. So if you look at the 39 for GSG last year it will be at 11 maybe 11 plus this year.\nAnd so you'd see on a collective basis for the Corporation CIG as a single biggest contribution on a relative basis because of its move.\nNoelle Dilts -- Stifel, Nicolaus -- Analyst\nOkay, very helpful. Thanks for that color. My second question I was hoping you could expand a little bit upon how you're thinking about M&A in terms of one your capital allocation properties. And two you mentioned you're up a little bit last quarter and little bit up earlier today, kind of how you're thinking about the metrics that are attractive geographies that are attractive and kind of the size of targets that should be looking at.\nDan L. Batrack -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nWell generally are in somewhat of Gnostic of size. What we're looking for is technical fit and to be best in class technically new markets. We do like firms are focused on water renewable energy environmental work.\nAreas that were underrepresented in the environment and water is the Asia Pacific market basically Australia and New Zealand. We can grow a lot of that organically but we are looking to bring on some additional partners there. So that would be one area.\nWe think we could then leverage the capabilities and experience we have here in the U.S. We are looking to add more program management expertise with respect to disaster recovery here in the U.S.\nAnd we're actually -- we think that there's some promising entities that would do well both for them and for us to join us to actually build even faster on their planning and recovery portion of the business.\nSo there is a technical and client area that we can make some good progress and translate very quickly to top and bottom line and add a longer tail or longer continuity with the recovery business. That's another area we're focused on.\nWe think there are not a lot of natural consolidators of that particular marketplace. And we think we're one of them. In some areas we're clearly to market leader in the upfront assessments area and in Europe. The reason you're up obviously mature market.\nUncertainty with the EU and Brexit and the rest of it but we do have a number of international clients that are either based in Europe or here. But on the commercial side that asked us to service them.\nAnd we are significantly underrepresented and resources in those areas. So we do think that that is the reason why we would go there. We're not looking to go to Europe naturally to be a growth market for us.\nIs not a badge of honor that if you can add some more multilingual resources that that's great for us. It's actually to service our clients and to provide continuity for the work that we are providing to them. So that is an area that would be looking.\nSo those would be some of the year is that a higher priority for us. We have been as you would note. We continue to bring on a very high talent to the company through acquisitions. What but we've also remained very disciplined.\nAnd so we don't feel a necessity to add top line just to drive any type of growth. It actually needs to fit our strategy be best-in-class and actually have those join us one to make this the career that will carry them to the end of their professional days.\nOperator\nThis will conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Dan Batrack to conclude.\nDan L.
