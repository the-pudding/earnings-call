My name is Thea and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners L.P. quarter one 2018 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question at this time, simply press * and the number 1 on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw the question, press the # key.\nThank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Burkhalter. Please go ahead, sir.\nRandy Burkhalter -- Vice President of Investor Relations \nThank you, Thea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 earnings. Our speakers today will be Jim Teague, Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise General Partner and he'll be Bryan Bulawa, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and currently available to enterprise's management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.\n\nPlease refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Randy. Our business performed exceptionally well in the first quarter, including records for net income, gross operating margin, and adjusted EBITDA. Excluding proceeds from asset sales, distributable cashflow was also a record. Record NGL and margin terminal volumes increased crude oil pipeline transportation and marine terminal volumes and higher natural gas pipeline transportation volumes led to three of our four business segments reporting higher results compared to first quarter last year.\nThese results are allowing us to consistently grow our profits, grow our distributions, plus make substantial headway toward equity self-funding. With a comfortable 1.5 times distribution coverage, we retained over $450 million to put back into our future growth. At Enterprise, it's probably time to quit thinking downturn. Today's results continued to prove that our future has really never looked brighter.\nThe first quarter, we were still in the ramp-up phase for two of our largest projects, our PDH plant in the Midland to ECHO crude oil pipeline. Both projects have now officially been put into service. On April 16th, we announced that our Midland to ECHO crude pipeline moved into full service with an expanded capacity of up to 475,000 barrels per day.\nSupporting the Midland to ECHO pipeline are several strategic supply aggregation projects, including a new 140-mile pipeline from Loving County, Texas, to Midland that is expected in service this quarter. Recent extreme basis differentials for Midland have been a significant source of attention. Pipeline, rail, and trucking capacity out of the Permian appears to be very tight for at least the next year and with no significant additional takeaway expected until the second half of '19, the timing of our new pipeline couldn't have been better.\nIn that regard, our press release notes a large non-cash market to market charge for the first quarter. Throughout 2017 as the Midland basis widened to values that exceeded our committed fees, we felt it was appropriate to take some price risk off the table and begin a capacity hedging program. As prices rose and production moved up, that basis began to blow out significantly, which resulted in a large non-cash market to market impact.\nAs these hedges roll off in future periods, these unrealized market to market adjustments will be reversed against actual revenues for those hedge periods. Our PDH plant began commercial service in April. Thus far in April, PDH has operated at an 84% average utilization rate. It's been a long time coming, but now it's time to enjoy the benefits of this project's solid supply and demand fundamentals, substantial fee-based cashflow with upside, the end of some very expensive bridging agreements and it's a great fit in our C3 value chain.\nWork on our iBDH is progressing with an expected second half next year start-up. As a reminder, half of this plant will fill excess capacity we have in our high-purity isobutylene and MTBE plants, which will allow us to upgrade additional NGLs into higher valued products. The other half is committed to an investment-grade customer through a 15-year fee-based contract on a feedstock—plus cost basis.\nWe have several ethylene projects including ethylene storage, a new pipeline, and our joint venture, ethylene export dock all scheduled for late into 2019. In NGLs, we started commissioning our first gas processing plant at Orla in the Delaware Basin in April.\nWe also have two other processing plants under construction at Orla with completion of our second Orla plant expected in the fourth quarter of this year and our third plant in the first half of 2019. We're also in the process of commissioning our 9th fractionator at Mount Belvieu, which is scheduled to be fully operational this quarter. Obviously, fractionation capacity is in high demand and is a key component in our value chain.\nLast, our Chinook Pipeline is progressing. This pipeline is expected to begin operation in 2019. We feel strongly that capacity expansions are imminent in order to keep up with the needs of our Permian customers. Summarizing our NGL projects between new processing plants, pipelines and fractionation, we have a considerable amount of NGL assets under construction, most of them supported by the Permian Basin with growing demand on the Gulf Coast and Mount Belvieu. The reality is as much as we have going on out there, we're really not done finding opportunities in that basin.\nBesides Midland crude oil basis differentials, probably the second most written about topic these days is the collapse in ethylene margins. When we announced our expansion into petrochemical midstream last year, we said that we expected price volatility and it's fair to say that's begun. But don't think of this as a signal to give up on US ethylene producers. Frackers have been running at a 95% rate as most US petrochemicals actually focus on ethane to polyethylene, where margins are currently about double that of historical norms.\nUS petrochemicals have extremely positive long-term fundamentals because of rich shale gas, which has given them a significant global advantage. Industry expansions of this magnitude in the US don't come without opportunities for enterprise. Enterprise has the premiere supply position in the industry to meet this growing feedstock demand and we're moving further into providing midstream-type services for both domestic and global petrochemicals.\nRefined products in late 2018, we expect a complete new infrastructure consisting of pipeline, storage, and dock upgrades, which will significantly increase our refined products export capabilities at Beaumont, as demand for US refined products continue to grow, especially in Latin America.\nA few words on demand growth. While the new crackers were delayed a little bit by Hurricane Harvey, those projects are now coming on line. Petrochemical demand for ethane is currently over one and a half million barrels a day and Tony Chovanec believes it could exceed 1.8 million barrels a day by year end.\nAlso on the topic of new demand, Enterprise liquid hydrocarbon exports continue to increase each month led by increases in demand for US crude. The name of the game for US production is exports, exports, exports, exports of crude oil, natural gas, ethane, LPG, petrochemicals, and refined products. Shown again by the results and statistics we published today, we don't think anyone is better situated to serve growing global demand in enterprise.\nFinally, I ended last quarter by saying that we feel really good about 2018 and our long-term opportunities. Obviously, that sentiment remains. Institutional investors and research analysts recently named Enterprise Products as one of the most admired companies in America in the institutional investor annual survey.\nWe want the investor community that follows us to know how much we appreciate the strong support that you continue to show for our company. We all understand the investment community has broadly shown a strong preference for investments outside of energy. The midstream sector has been out of favor, admittedly somewhat self-infected.\nRegardless, Enterprise will continue with what we have always done, deliver results, assistant distribution growth and generate long-term value. Obviously, long-term investors in the debt markets recognize the opportunities they have in Enterprise. We feel strongly that there will come a time when the equity markets, including the retail community will quit focusing on the sector we're in and instead, focus on the quality company we are. It's kind of like not one of us can pick the family we're in, but we are responsible for our own performance. We will continue to be responsible for our performance.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bryan.\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Jim's enthusiasm. We are pleased with our record operational and financial performance. While our first and fourth quarters are typically seasonally strong periods, our operational and financial performance over the last several quarters demonstrates Enterprise as a uniquely positioned, integrated midstream system. We continue to benefit from increasing supply, domestic hydrocarbons and strong demand from both domestic and global markets.\nThe fundamentals surrounding our business are strong and we are excited about the prospects for continuing growth. I will now review a few income statement items for the first quarter, reiterate our expectations for our growth and sustaining capital expenditures for 2018, and wrap up with an overview of our balance sheet metrics and equity funding objectives.\nStarting with the income statement items -- net income attributable to limited partners for the first quarter of 2018 was $901 million or $0.41 per unit on a fully diluted basis compared to $761 million or $0.36 per unit on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter of 2017.\nWe recognized a non-cash $37 million gain in the first quarter of 2018 or $0.02 per fully diluted unit attributable to the March 29th, 2018 step acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in our 150 million cubic feet per day Delaware Basin gas processing plant located in Reeves County, Texas. The purchase price for this ownership interest was $150 million. We also recognized a total of $140 million non-cash market to market loss during the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to the Midland to Houston and Midland to Cushing Basis Hedges.\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expenses were $18 million higher compared to the same quarter of 2017 due to the Midland to ECHO pipeline and a few smaller capital projects being placed into service since the first quarter of 2017. Total capital spending in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.1 billion, including $66 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For the full year of 2018, we currently anticipate investing in approximately $3.2 billion to $3.4 million in growth capital expenditures, with this range including the aforementioned acquisition of 50% interest in the Delaware Basin gas processing facility. Further, we expect our sustaining capital expenditures for 2018 to be approximately $315 million.\nMoving to our balance sheet, at March 31st, 2018, our total debt principal outstanding was $25.6 billion. The average life of our debt portfolio was 14.8 years, assuming the first call date for our hybrids and our effective average cost of debt was 4.6%. It should also be noted that over 90% of our debt portfolio is fixed rate, thereby insulating our cost of debt capital in a rising interest rate environment.\nOn February 1st, we issued an aggregate of $2.7 billion in the debt capital markets comprised of $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior unsecured 30-year notes, $750 million of 2.8% senior unsecured three-year notes and $700 million of five and three-eighths percent 60-year non-call 10 junior subordinated notes. Proceeds from the $700 million junior subordinated note issuance reused in March of 2018 to redeem all of the $682.7 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.03% junior subordinated notes due in 2068.\nThis redemption results in annual interest expense savings of $11.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended March 31th, 2018 was $5.9 billion and our consolidated leverage ratio was 4.1 times after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of the hybrid debt securities by the rating agencies and further reduced for cash and cash equivalence.\nWorking capital requirements remain elevated by approximately $475 million, which is largely comprised of margin requirements on the exchanges associated with the recent widening of the Midland to Houston basis spreads against our executed Midland to ECHO and Midland to Cushing hedging programs, which is more fully described in today's press release.\nWhen also taking into account the pro forma benefit for contracted growth projects under construction during the quarter, our adjusted leverage ratio was approximately 3.7 times. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $5 billion at March 31st, 2018, which included available barn capacity under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash.\nFinally, during the first quarter, we retained $458 million in excess distributable cashflow, which alone funded 45% of our first quarter, 2018 growth capital expenditures. Just to reiterate Jim's comments in the press release, when factoring in our anticipated retained distributable cashflow for the full year of 2018 and expected proceeds from the distribution reinvestment program or our drip and the employee unit purchase program or UPP, we do not anticipate any additional external equity needs for this year.\nFor 2019, we continue to anticipate a fully self-funded equity model excluding the drip and the UPP participation on an approximate $3 billion growth capital investment profile, while preserving our target leverage objective of 3.75 to 4 times.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Randy for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter -- Vice President of Investor Relations \nThank you, Bryan. We're ready to take questions from our listeners. Thea?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone that if you would like to ask a question to press *1 on your telephone keypad now. Again, ladies and gentlemen, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll pause for just a moment.\nThe first question will come from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan.\nJeremy Toney -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nGood morning. Congrats on the strong quarter there. I was wondering for the Midland pipe, how were you able to expand it to 575? Was this drag-reducing agents? Is this the final level of expansion or could this be pushed further?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nIt was primarily due to drag-reducing agents and very little additional upside over what we've announced.\nJeremy Toney -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for that. Just wanted to go a bit more as far as the growth projects in the future, you guys seem to be having a lot of conversations, but just wanted to see a bit more if this could be -- what part of your business this could be. Is it more in the downstream petrochemical side? Is it more on the Permian side? Are there other areas that you see growth, anything that you can share with us there?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nI think the answer to your question is yes.\nJeremy Toney -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay. We'll wait for that, then. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust Robinson.\nTristan Richardson -- SunTrust Robinson -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, guys. Just curious in terms of the CapEx outlook for this year. It seems to be up a little bit. Is it just pull forward from current projects that are on plan?\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Tristan, it's Bryan. Some of the movement is partially because of the acquisitions that we've already announced with the one I've mentioned in the script with respect to the Delaware Basin gas facility as well as, if you recall, we also purchased land on the ship channel. So, those acquisitions, and then you also had a little bit of scope changes with some existing projects which have expanded on those projects. Let me be clear -- that's not a cost overrun but the lead expansion of those existing projects.\nTristan Richardson -- SunTrust Robinson -- Analyst\nThanks, Bryan. That's helpful. In terms of Chinook, you talked a little bit recently about anticipating early expansions on that, just curious what the factors are that influencing decisions on the initial capacity designed for Chinook.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nWe're seeing more volume, building more plants. Tony, you got anything? That's the essence of it. People are wanting to move. People get nervous about takeaway in the Permian.\nTony Chovanec -- Senior Vice President\nI would say the Delaware Basin part of the Permian really continues to exceed. That's a large reason for capacity. Anything to add?\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nThat's exactly what the customer wants. We're seeing very strong interest in it.\nTristan Richardson -- SunTrust Robinson -- Analyst\nFair enough. Appreciate it. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning, Chris. You there?\nOperator\nChris, your line is open.\nChris Sighinolfi -- Jefferies & Company -- Managing Director\nI'm sorry. Hello, guys. Can you hear me now?\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah.\nChris Sighinolfi -- Jefferies & Company -- Managing Director\nSorry about that. Good morning. Much of the discussion around enterprise is export activity as centered on the ship channel, Beaumont, and Corpus, but I did see an industry article last week suggesting you guys had a VLCC in Texas City. I thought the draft there was too shallow to permit that caliber of vessel. So, just curious what you're working on in Texas City. Any color would be helpful.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. This is Jim. First of all, all the press talks about Enterprise's Texas City dock and it's really not enterprise's Texas City dock it's Seaway's Texas City dock, which is a joint venture between Enterprise and Enbridge. We work closely on those Seaway docks at Texas City and Freeport. If I was Al Monaco, I'd get a little irritated seeing Enterprise's Texas City docks. Now, Enbridge is a partner in that.\nThe only thing we did is we want to see what's possible. So, we brought up the LCCN. We didn't load anything on it. All we're doing is taking measurements and seeing if the load arms work. We're evaluating the information we've got so far. Preliminary, it looks good. You're right about the draft. The time set would be we'd load a laddering vessel and follow the VLCC out and transload it. It's a pretty simple concept, but we think it may grow legs.\nChris Sighinolfi -- Jefferies & Company -- Managing Director\nTo understand that, Jim, partially load the vessel at the dock, then ferry it out and then fully load it offshore.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. We can probably get 1.1 million, 1.2 million barrels on that. We would have a laddering vessel at the Houston Ship Channel. They'd follow each other out and transload. Frankly, we're just saying physically does it work? Then we'll take a look at the economics. We're talking to some people that are in that business to see if we could put legs to this. It's kind of a neat concept.\nChris Sighinolfi -- Jefferies & Company -- Managing Director\nYeah. It's not part of what I had been considering before. We heard some other pure stock about offshore activity, but not the sort of hybrid option you're talking about. That's interesting. Secondly, I had a question on the Midland ECHO pipe. I hadn't realized it was a 20% outstanding option on that line, probably just an oversight on my part. But I'm curious if any of the other inflight expansions include ownership options which you're paying attention to.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nOn that pipeline, Jeremy? Chris, you mean on Midland Sealy?\nChris Sighinolfi -- Jefferies & Company -- Managing Director\nYeah, Midland Sealy, I hadn't realized it was that option. So, I was just curious. Two questions -- one, is $200 million roughly the proportional cost of construction and two, are there other assets that you're building we should pay attention to that have buy in options either by shippers or third parties.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nWhat I'm going to do is I'll throw you back to how this company was built. Dan, we've got a number of joint ventures, everything from fractionators or gas parents to you name it. In every case, they brought more than money. They brought production or they brought offtake. So, if you see us include a joint venture partner, you can bet he's bringing a lot of money and it supports our entire value chain. I'm not going to comment as to whether or not what we that we haven't announced yet.\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nChris, this is Bryan. As far as the proportional, yes, that is representative of the proportional cost.\nChris Sighinolfi -- Jefferies & Company -- Managing Director\nOkay. Great. Thanks a lot for taking my question this morning, guys, and congrats on a great question.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Managing Director\nHi, good morning, guys. Just a first off before getting my questions, I just want to confirm something you said to Tristan earlier about NGLs versus crude lines. Are you saying customers are more worried about NGLs versus crude lines? Are you saying that customers are actually shifted and worried about NGL capacity now and that's why you're not looking at converting the NGL line?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nI wouldn't say we weren't looking at converting an NGL line. I think we clearly have said we're taking a hard look at that and we expect that -- frankly, I think we'll do it, but I'm not sure what the timing will be.\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Managing Director\nSort of shifting a little bit here, I think Bryan had walked through why the CapEx numbers were up a little bit this year, but I was wondering where you're seeing opportunities in how large that can be. I ask that against the context of last year, you had lowered your distribution growth rate to be self-funded, but you just put up a 1.5 times covered quarter and you've got a lot of retained DCF. Do we get back on to a higher growth plane going forward?\nRandy Burkhalter -- Vice President of Investor Relations \nYeah, Shneur, this is Randy. The first thing is the largest component to getting to self-funding from an equity standpoint was EBITDA expansion. If you would, moderating the distribution growth was a very small part of it. So, we're expecting -- the performance in the first quarter didn't necessarily surprise us. With that, as far as growth prospects, I think we were continuing to see good conversation around projects on the demand side, but now you're seeing more projects on the supply side as well. I'd really say some of these growth opportunities really had all four segments.\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Managing Director\nSo, would it be fair to say you weren't surprised by the performance in the first quarter, that you would expect those metrics to continue throughout the year?\nRandy Burkhalter -- Vice President of Investor Relations \nLet's not get ahead of ourselves. I think I'd go back to what Bryan said -- our strongest quarters are our first quarters and fourth quarters, just seasonally.\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Managing Director\nOkay. Fair enough. And one final question here. I recognize that you had said at the time when the FERC first put out their decision not a material impact to Enterprise, but I wonder if it restarted a conversation about the corporate structure for Enterprise. Many have opined recently that ticking the box would not necessarily impact too many unit holders and at the same time, given your CapEx spend and ability to expense it, there wouldn't be too much of a tax expectation going forward. Has that conversation restarted? Are you thinking about it or talking about it internally?\nRandy Burkhalter -- Vice President of Investor Relations \nI don't think any more so than what we had been in the past. We look at it periodically. It's a big step. Right now, we don't see anything that's compelling that leads us to come in and check the box. When we come in look at valuations and things of that nature, there's not anything, a differentiator, between an MLP and a C corp from that perspective. Right now, we continue to monitor it. We'll update our evaluation from time to time, but no development on that front.\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Managing Director\nGreat. Thank you very much, guys, appreciate the color.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.\nColton Bean -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. -- Vice President, Equity Research \nGood morning. So, I just want to kick it back over to Midland to Sealy, with the remaining 30,000 barrels or so of unhedged, uncontracted capacity, are you comfortable with that exposure or would you also consider further hedging if the forward curve widens out again?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nWe always consider everything. Frankly, we just -- I'm not going to signal commercially what we're going to do.\nColton Bean -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. -- Vice President, Equity Research \nGot it. Then just in terms of Gulf Coast LPG, it looks like the industry moved nearly a million barrels a day out of docks in Q1, pretty close to nameplate there. Could you just remind us around your optimization activity around the cold storage and what maybe a timeline would be to reach that 35% capacity increase?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nYou've got a good memory. You must have been at the analyst conference. We're working on that right now. Frankly, I think we have a couple of three options that we're looking at. That's one of them. I think what we're going to find is we've got a pretty inexpensive expansion capability. It's just which one do we pick. What you mentioned is one of them.\nColton Bean -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. -- Vice President, Equity Research \nOkay. So, likely leaving the dock loading rates as is and just figuring out how to optimize to max those out?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nWe could increase the loading rates.\nColton Bean -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. -- Vice President, Equity Research \nUnderstood. Okay. Just the final one. So, on the fee-based processing, it looked like volumes were effectively flat quarter over quarter, but you should have had a bit of a tailwind there from South Eddy. So, can you just walk us through some of the moving pieces in the different regions?\nBradley Motal -- Senior Vice President\nThis is Brad. We see our Delaware Basin continuing to ramp up. There has been a little bit of a lag from our producers from what we've seen as far as our initial schedule, but that volume is still showing up a little bit late. And then in the Eagle Ford, volumes continue to grow and same thing up in the Rockies in Pinedale region. So, we're flat. I think it just balances, some a little bit later than normal, some better than we anticipated.\nColton Bean -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. -- Vice President, Equity Research \nGot it. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Brian Zarahn with Mizuho.\nBrian Zarahn -- Mizuho -- Analyst\nGood morning. On the subject of exports, it seems like crude exports exceeded NGL exports for the first time on your system. Is that trend continuing in April?\nBrent Secrest -- Senior Vice President\nThis is Brent. April, the trend continues. We'll see what happens down the road. We had some cancellations in the first quarter, but it was more positive just around crude oil. Going forward as the volumes increased, obviously our belief is that those will have to be exported. Then we'll have to work on the next project to find more supply for crude oil.\nBrian Zarahn -- Mizuho -- Analyst\nAnd then sticking in the Permian, any updates on a potential gas pipe project?\nBradley Motal -- Senior Vice President\nThis is Brad again. We continue to evaluate it. I'll echo what Jim and Brian said. We're talking to producers. We're talking to potential partners trying to figure out everything it takes to figure out if we're going to make this thing fly or not.\nBrian Zarahn -- Mizuho -- Analyst\nThe last one from me, given the projects you're looking to add to your backlog, is $3 billion still a reasonable estimate for CapEx next year?\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nAs far as what we're looking at, yes.\nBrian Zarahn -- Mizuho -- Analyst\nThanks, Bryan.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Matthew Phillips with Guggenheim.\nMatthew Phillips -- Guggenheim -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. Follow up on the crude hedging program you all initiated, the recovery there, would we expect to see that evenly spread through the lifespan of that through '19? How should we view that?\nDaniel Boss -- Senior Vice President\nThis is Daniel Boss. If you look at the total recognized loss during the first quarter on that program and then combine that with what was recognized through December of 2017, we expect about $118 million to reverse in the second through fourth quarter of 2018, an additional $40 million to reverse in 2019.\nMatthew Phillips -- Guggenheim -- Analyst\nGot it. On the NGL conversion, once you have sufficient commercial interest, how long will that take from when you decide until when it's in service.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nLess than a year.\nMatthew Phillips -- Guggenheim -- Analyst\nGot it. Okay. That's all for me. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.\nDarren Horowitz -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. Jim, my first question -- with a lot of the new crackers expected to start up, let's just say into May and even into June if they get pushed back a little bit, what's your in house view on regional ethane netbacks? Is there the opportunity if we can soak up some of that rejected ethane and ethane prices get up to about $0.30 by the middle of this year, hypothetically on page to exit in that mid-$0.30 range, do you guys foresee some regional arbitrage opportunities happening and what do you think that could mean from an opportunistic processing perspective for you?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nTook young long enough to get on the phone, Darren.\nBrent Secrest -- Senior Vice President\nIn terms of ethane prices, what you're seeing is some competition for the pipe. So, when you see some stranded barrels up in Conway, that leads to potentially some ethane that may not get in the pipe, which lessens supply. I think it's fairly well-known that frack space is tight right now and we haven't seen that for a while. I can create a bullish case for ethane. I don't think it's a long-term bullish case. I think it's a short-term bullish case. Then once you see pipelines come online and frack space starting to lighten up as the fracks come online, then I think maybe things get back to normal. Certainly in the short-term, there's going to be a fight for pipeline space.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nI think what he just said is yes, we see arbitrage opportunities. Is that when you said, Brent?\nBrent Secrest -- Senior Vice President\nYeah, I said it in more words, though.\nDarren Horowitz -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nI got it. Jim, just kind of a big picture, more hypothetical question -- it seems like this trade war issue or tariff issue with the US and China continues to get kicked around. Recently, there's been more discussion talking about what that could do with regard to US propane exports and any thoughts on possibly an issue with reneging on long-term binding contracts and if that happens, then that could discount barrels to find other markets and maybe the Chinese demand could be met by a bid up of Mideast barrels possibly depressing US product and leaving it stuck at the dock. How do you navigate all this mess? How do you think it plays out?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nFirst of all, I get out of the fetal position in the corner of my office. I'm not worried about it, Darren. First of all, there's been no tariffs imposed. We don't have one contract -- no, we've got one contract with a Chinese company. If it happens -- there's a demand for LPG. It's not just China. It's Korea. It's India. So, I don't worry that, \"Okay, China won't import our propane.\" Well, they're going to import somebody's propane, which is going to leave somebody else needing propane.\nDarren Horowitz -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nSo, maybe the better way to think about it is the physical product will price to move.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nYes.\nDarren Horowitz -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nOkay. And then finally, for me, Bryan, just one quick housekeeping question -- and I guess we can do the math in reverse -- but what's the aggregate value of the Midland to ECHO hedges and more importantly, what's the timing and magnitude as to when they get settled between now and the end of 2019?\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nI'm going to let Daniel answer that.\nDaniel Boss -- Senior Vice President\nSo, Darren, the aggregate value is $156 million that we recognize through March. Like I mentioned before, if you look at that on the way it roles off, about $118 million rolls off for the balance of this year and then $38 million for 2019. Now, that implies that these valuations are as of March 31st. So, as spreads continue to widen in April, we continue to see additional losses materialize. So, you might see additional losses in April and in the second quarter, that would lead to even larger reversals to the upside from that period forward.\nDarren Horowitz -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Just a quick one on PDH -- should we expect another material step-up in Q2 or are you already getting most of the run rate contribution in Q1?\nRandy Burkhalter -- Vice President of Investor Relations \nYeah. You should see another step up in Q2 because really, we were operating at around 60% of capacity for February and March and now we're starting out the second quarter where we're approximately 84% in April.\nKeith Stanley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. And just a quick clarification as well -- when we're discussing all these market to market impact around the Midland-Sealy hedges, all of this is stripped out of EBITDA and DCN, so it's not really impacting those headline numbers, right?\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nKeith, that is absolutely correct.\nKeith Stanley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Barrett Blaschke with MUFG Securities.\nBarrett Blaschke -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst\nHey, guys. Just with the ramp up that we saw in petrochemical, I know a lot of this is PDH, but how much of this is pure commodity sensitivity in that business line and what else is going on that's pushing that?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nIn our petrochemicals?\nBarrett Blaschke -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst\nYeah.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nOne of the things, every pound we produce off the PDH is a bridge pound we don't have to sell. Those bridge pounds were not great deals for us. So, every time we produce a pound off a PDH, we sell a pound off the splitters at quite a bit more than we were selling it for. Is that it, Bryan?\nBarrett Blaschke -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst\nYeah, that helps. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Vikram Bagri with Citi.\nVikram Bagri -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. I have one more question on hedging -- could you talk about the extent of hedging on the basin pipeline, anything you can share on that front? We understand the hedging on Midland to Sealy very well, but anything you can talk about on the basin pipeline.\nBrent Secrest -- Senior Vice President\nI won't talk in volumes, but we have had some basin pipeline space out.\nVikram Bagri -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nOkay. And any hedge price or average hedge price on that?\nBrent Secrest -- Senior Vice President\nDid you ask if there was a fixed price on that?\nVikram Bagri -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nYeah.\nBrent Secrest -- Senior Vice President\nIt's done at various levels. I don't have the number right in front of me what the weighted average is, but it's obviously less than where the market is today.\nVikram Bagri -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nThe second question I have was on the Sealy pipeline, any updated on that --\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nHe needs to pick his phone up and get off the speaker.\nBrent Secrest -- Senior Vice President\nSeaway pipeline hedges?\nVikram Bagri -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nDRAs on Seaway pipeline.\nBrent Secrest -- Senior Vice President\nThat's a monthly optimization exercise we look at, running DRA versus running horsepower. That's just an optimization exercise.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nCan you pick your phone up because being on speaker? We can't hear you very well?\nVikram Bagri -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nI apologize. I'm in a conference room. I'm going to try to speak loudly. I understand that Seaway pipeline can be expanded by 100,000 barrels a day. That was my understanding from your analyst day. Is that still the case? Can you expand it by 100,000 barrels a day by adding DRAs?\nGraham Bacon -- Executive Vice President\nWe can do a little bit, but I don't know where the 100,000 barrel a day number came from. This is Graham.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe there were ships passing in the night because I don't remember saying we're expanding at 100,000 barrels a day.\nVikram Bagri -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nI can follow up offline. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to go back to your original comments on the ethylene margins and just make sure I understand. Your view is it's a temporary issue and that globally there will be enough demand to absorb all the derivative products as you have this big ramp up in supply on the Gulf Coast. Can you go back over that?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nI'm going to turn it over to Tony in a minute, Michael. As we look forward -- I tell Tony all the time he's wrong, but his trend is right. What we see in ethylene derivatives and propylene derivatives over the next few years is a pretty strong growth and demand.\nTony Chovanec -- Senior Vice President\nI think to Jim's point earlier, for some reason, the industry has decided to focus on ethane to ethylene margins, but that's not the endgame and really not where the focus should be because that's not where petrochemicals stop.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nNow, if you're a merchant producer of ethylene -- and I think there are two plants in the country that are totally merchant producers -- you're probably sweating right now. But if you're a Dow or an Exxon Chemical, you're looking at ethane to polyethylene margins of $0.50 a pound, Tony?\nTony Chovanec -- Senior Vice President\nYes.\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nNot bad.\nMichael Blum -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you. My second question is I guess just in light of some of the issues in the Northeast with NLG takeaway on the Mariner systems, have you seen any renewed interest in shippers looking to maybe rejuvenate that project and try to get an ATEX or another project to move NGLs straight down to the Gulf Coast?\nJames Teague -- Director and Chief Executive Officer\nI wish I could say yes, Michael, but I can't.\nMichael Blum -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Denise Coleman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDennis Coleman -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThat's Dennis Coleman. Thank you very much. Just one quick question, mine have mostly been hit -- Bryan, could you tell us what was the drip in the employee purchases for the quarter?\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nFor the first quarter, it was inclusive of the Duncan family's participation. It was $177 million.\nDennis Coleman -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nSo, excluding, I guess, the Duncan participation, is that a good run rate for the rest of the year?\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt would appear so, yes.\nDennis Coleman -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOkay. I guess just sort of backing into the strength of the retained earnings not likely to need the markets at all, even for an ATM this year?\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nNot at all. That's correct. And Dennis, we haven't touched on the ATM since the first week of July in 2017.\nDennis Coleman -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nPerfect. Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.\nOperator\nThe next question is a follow up from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies.\nBryan Bulawa -- Chief Financial Officer\nChris, you there?\nOperator\nChris, your line is open.\nChris Sighinolfi -- Jefferies & Company -- Managing Director\nHey, guys. Sorry. All my questions were answered. Sorry about that.\nRandy Burkhalter -- Vice President of Investor Relations \nThea, do you want to give our listeners the replay information for this call?
