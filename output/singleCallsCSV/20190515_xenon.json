Our results may differ materially from those projected on today's call. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. Today's press release summarizing our first quarter 2019 results and the accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available on the investor section of our website at www.xenon-pharma.com and filed with the SEC and on CDAR.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Simon.\nSimon Pimstone -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Jodi and good afternoon, everyone. I gave a detailed update on each of Xenon's therapeutic candidates during our recent year-end conference call. So, my aim today is to provide a brief status update on each of our clinical stage programs and to allow for questions at the end of this call. We continue to make significant progress, advancing our robust pipeline of neurology-focused product candidates, including XEN496, XEN1101, XEN901, and XEN007.\nSupported by a strong balance sheet, we are executing our clinical development plans with the goal of having multiple products in Phase 2 or later stage development this year. On today's call, I'll highlight some of the important milestone events anticipated during the second half of this year.\nLet me begin with XEN496, the Kv7 potassium channel modulator that we're developing as a treatment for KCNQ2 epilepsy, a rare severe pediatric seizure and neurodevelopmental disorder. While the active ingredient, ezogabine, was previously approved by the FDA as a treatment for adult focal epilepsy, published case series also reported on the successful use of ezogabine in children with KCNQ2 epilepsy, suggesting that XEN496 could be efficacious in this mostly difficult to treat pediatric patient population with good reported tolerability.\nWhile non-controlled, these clinical series as well as additional anecdotal parental and physician feedback reported improvements in seizure burden as well as in development and in behavior. Importantly, Xenon received orphan drug designation or ODD from the FDA for XEN496 as a treatment of KCANQ2 epilepsy. In response to our pre-IND briefing package submission, the FDA indicated that it was acceptable to study XEN496 in infants and children up to 4 years old and that a single pivotal trial in approximately 20 patients may be considered adequate provided we show evidence of a locally meaningful drug effect.\nRecognizing that ezogabine was initially developed as a hard-coated tablet that is unsuitable for use in children, we are currently finalizing a pediatric-specific formulation and expect to complete pre-clinical formulation testing with a final drug product by the end of this quarter.\nWe've decided to test the novel improved XEN496 pediatric formulation in a PK study of healthy adult volunteers, which is expected to be initiated in the third quarter of 2019. We anticipate that this adult PK study will provide us important information to help ensure that our pediatric formulation is providing adequate drug exposure in the plasma before advancing the product into pediatric patients in the planned Phase 3 trial. Given this, we now expect to file an IND application in the fourth quarter of this year in order to initiate the Phase 3 clinical trial in KCNQ2 epilepsy.\nOur approach with XEN496 provides us with an opportunity to use the precision medicine approach to potentiality treat KCNQ2 pediatric epilepsy. We believe our XEN496 Phase 3 clinical trial will be the first precision medicine trial of an anti-epileptic drug in a generic form of epilepsy. We're excited to take this leadership role in advancing novel medicines that can potentially address the underlying genetic mutations in these epileptic encephalopathies.\nWe look forward to providing additional details about final trial design and final endpoints as these plans progress and as we get closer to filing the IND.\nNext up in our pipeline is XEN1101, a highly differentiated best in class next generation Kv7 potassium channel modulator being developed for the treatment of focal adult epilepsy with potential application to other neurological disorders such as ALS, tinnitus, and major depressive illness.\nAt the last annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society, we announced promising final results from the XEN1101 Phase 1 clinical trial, including the transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS study. As a brief summary, the Phase 1 XEN1101 data include a PK profile that supports once a day dosing and exhibited good tolerability in projected efficacious doses. All AEs were mild or moderate with a majority being mild. Results spontaneously and were consistent with antiepileptic drugs of this class. There were no serious AEs or clinically significant ECG or lab findings.\nThe Phase 1b TMS study provides evidence of the CNS effect of a single 20-milligram dose of XEN1101 as indicated by the suppression of cortical and corticospinal excitability as measured by EEG and EMG, respectively. Our assessment of the complete package of Phase 1 data supported our advancement of XEN1101 into Phase 2b development. Additionally, the results of the TMS study helped with dose selection for our XEN1101 Phase 2b clinical trial where this 20-milligram dose was set as the mid-dose of three active dose arms.\nWe recently initiated the Phase 2b clinical trial in adult patients with focal epilepsy. The trial is designed as a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multi-center study to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of XEN1101 administered as adjuvant treatment in adult patients with focal epilepsy. Approximately 300 patients will be randomized in a blinded manner to one of three active treatment groups or placebo in a two to one to one to two fashion using doses of XEN1101 of 25 milligrams, 20 milligrams, and 10 milligrams plus a placebo arm.\nThe primary endpoint in this trial is the median percent change in monthly focal seizure frequency from baseline compared to treatment period of active versus placebo. An IND or IND-equivalent application for XEN1101 has been accepted now by numerous regulatory authorities, including the FDA, and cite selection and patient enrollment are now under way for the trial in the United States, Canada, and Europe.\nTopline results from the XEN1101 Phase 2b clinical trial are anticipated in the second half of 2020. This timeline is, of course, dependent on the rate of enrollment, which we expect to have a better idea of by the time we release our Q2 results.\nTurning to the third product in our pipeline XEN901, the potent, highly selective Nav1.6 sodium channel inhibitor being developed for the treatment of epilepsy -- we have completed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate XEN901 safety, tolerability, and PK in both single ascending and multiple ascending dose cohorts of healthy adult subjects and we included a pilot TMS arm as well. We reported data from an XEN901 Phase 1 clinical trial and related pilot TMS study at the December AES meeting.\nTo summarize these promising results, XEN901 PK data demonstrated dose proportionality with a predicted half-life of 8 to 11 hours, which suggests that XEN901 could be compatible with a once or twice-daily dosing regimen. The majority of AEs in the Phase 1 trial were deemed unrelated to XEN901, all were mild or moderate for the majority being mild were transient and resolved spontaneously. There have no serious AEs or clinically significant ECG vital signs or laboratory findings.\nWithin a pilot TMS study, like with XEN1102, the observed changes in TMS EMG and TMS EEG parameters suggest activity of XEN901 in the target CNS tissue. Based on the PK and safety profile demonstrated by XEN901 in the Phase 1 clinical trial along with our ability to reach exposure in humans, where we demonstrate efficacy in pre-clinical models, we are now planning for Phase 2 development.\nWe expect to evaluate XEN901 as a treatment for rare pediatric forms of epilepsy, including SCN8A epilepsy or for adult focal seizures. A briefing document has already been submitted for our type B meeting and the pathway forward will depend upon feedback from the FDA outlining the requirements to advance XEN901 directly into pediatric SCN8A epilepsy patients. We expect to receive the feedback within this quarter. In order to support future pediatric development plans, juvenile toxicology studies and formulation work are well under way.\nOur fourth product is XEN007, the CNS-acting T-type calcium channel modulator that contains the active ingredient flunarizine. Other reported mechanisms include dopamine, histamine, and serotonin inhibition. Available in certain countries outside the United States, flunarizine has been reported to have clinical benefits in treating migraine and vertigo and off-label in a nm of other neurological disorders, including hemiplegic migraine, alternating hemiplegia of childhood, and as an adjunctive treatment in certain epilepsies including childhood absence epilepsy.\nThe FDA has granted Xenon a rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of AHC with XEN007 and has also granted ODD for XEN007 as a treatment of both AHC and hemiplegic migraine. Given the widespread use of flunarizine, various development strategies for XEN007 are under consideration. We've had a number of discussions with physicians who have expressed good interested in supporting investing sponsored studies. In 2019, we anticipate initiating at least one Phase 2 or later clinical trial in an often neurological indication.\nThat concludes my status updates on each of our clinical stage programs. Looking at our pre-clinical work, our R&D team continues to make exciting advancements on a number of potential development candidates. I look forward to keeping you up with your progress over the coming months. In parallel, we are conducting go/no go experiments on other assets from outside the company to allow decision making or new development stage ready products. We expect to be in a position to provide additional updates in the second half of this year.\nSo, to summarize today's comments, we continue to diligently execute on our clinical development strategies to support four very promising drug candidates all poised to potentially be in Phase 2 or later stage development this year.\nWe are very excited about our neurology-focused pipeline and we look forward to the anticipate near-term advancement of our novel precision medicine therapies designed to address rare pediatric disorders such as KCNQ2 or SCN8A epilepsies while alternating hemiplegia of childhood as well as targeting broader patient populations such as adults with focal epilepsy or children with more common forms of childhood epilepsy.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Ian who will briefly recap our financial position after completing the first quarter of 2019. Ian?\nIan Mortimer -- President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Simon. The specific details within our financial statements are covered in today's press release as well as in our 10-Q filing. So, I'll provide an overview of the cash position, our cash runway guidance and then I'll conclude with a review of upcoming milestones.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31st, 2019 were $110.4 million. This compares to $119.3 million as of December 31st, 2018. As of March 31st, 2019, we had approximately 25.8 million common shares outstanding and approximately 1 million series one preferred shares outstanding. These are convertible into common shares on a one for one basis at the option of a holder subject to certain limitations.\nBased on our current assumptions which include fully supporting the planed clinical development of XEN496, XEN1101, XEN901, and XEN007, we anticipate having sufficient cash to fund our operations into 2021. This excludes any revenue generated from either existing partnerships or potential new partnering arrangements.\nSo, with this backdrop of a strong balance sheet, we look forward to a number of important anticipated milestone events upcoming, including the initiation of the Phase 3 clinical trial for XEN496 as a treatment for KCNQ2 epilepsy, advancing our ongoing XEN1101 Phase 2b clinical trial in adult focal epilepsy, initiating the Phase 2 clinical trial for XEN901 in either pediatric XEN8A epilepsy or adult focal epilepsy.\nThis depends on FDA feedback, which we expect to receive this quarter, and initiating a Phase 2 or later clinical trial with XEN007 in an orphan neurological condition such as alternating hemiplegia of childhood, hemiplegic migraine or childhood op sans epilepsy.\nSo, I speak for the entire Xenon team when I say that we are driven to deliver results and propel our neurology pipeline into mid and late-stage clinical development this year. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.\nOperator, we can now open the call up for questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press the * then the number 1 key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the # key. Again, that's * then 1 to ask a question. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated.\nOur first question comes from Paul Matteis of Stifel. You may proceed with your question.\nPaul Matteis -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Managing Director\nGreat. Thanks so much for the updates, appreciate it. A couple questions on 496 and then one on 901 -- on 496, can you clarify this healthy volunteer study -- was this something that was asked for by the regulators or did you decide to do it to better describe the pharmacokinetics going to patients?\nThen second, I was wondering if you could talk about any additional pre-clinical toxicology work you have to do in juvenile models and whether or not you're comfortable that all of the old chronic toxicology work that was done with animals is fully leverageable for when you ultimately file an NDA? Thanks.\nSimon Pimstone -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Paul. Two very important questions -- the first question, this is not an FDA-mandated study. We have not engaged the FDA at all on the need for the adult PK with the new drug product. This was our internal decision solely. I think the clinical team just felt we weren't going to lose much time. It was more beneficial to have the study done and to be able to use that information without submission to the FDA rather than risk being told to do the study in a submission where we expected there would be an even greater delay.\nSo, the time lost doing this is actually very, very little. It's probably a month or so versus what might have been a more significant delay had we waited. So, we think this is a prudent way to move forward. It certainly wasn't FDA-mandated, but we think it's good clinical practice.\nOn the second question, which is do we think we need to do any pre-clinical talks, assuming that's coming from the experience that Zogenix has had with an older molecule. All I can say, Paul is we were very deliberate in asking the FDA in writing whether the current data for which they had a right of reference from GSK was sufficient in terms of the non-clinical data to support a Phase 3 start. The answer back from the in writing recently was yes, it was sufficient. In other words, no additional non-clinical work was deemed necessary for the Phase 3 start.\nOf course, we haven't asked them the question whether there's anything that might be deemed necessary for registration. We obviously have to think that through and really study the studies and engage the FDA on that. But we don't believe there is anything required based on written and fairly recent feedback from the FDA.\nOne thing you should remember is the time at which the toxicology work was done on fenfluramine versus on ezogabine-retigabine was decades apart, such that ezogabine would have fallen under the newer ICHGLP toxicity guidelines. So, whether that is the underlying issue with respect to fenfluramine, I don't know, but I think we can certainly at least say that ezogabine toxicity was done much more recently and done under newer acceptable guidelines.\nPaul Matteis -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Managing Director\nGreat. Thank you for all of the color and context on that. Then just one on SCN8A, assuming that you get the go ahead to go straight into that pau population, do you have a good sense of whether or not there are certain clinical centers that have genetically tested and diagnosed a high number of these patients and whether or not you can begin those efforts before ultimately initiating the Phase 2?\nSimon Pimstone -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. That's another important point. I think it's fair to say there probably aren't centers that have high numbers of these patients. So, I don't assume, for example, there's any center where one specialist is looking after double-digit numbers of these patients. So, we do expect in a clinical study we'll be building this trial across multiple centers, where just like for KCNQ2, we would look to budget about one patient per center per year.\nWe know, for example, that Invitae and GeneDx and others in Europe are doing screening at an increasing rate. I think over 300 US institutions have ordered tests through Invitae, for example. We will be getting monthly and are getting monthly reports as part of our behind the seizures collaboration with Invitae. We're building registries. We also know, for example, for the SCN8A population we're collaborating with an academic who has a registry of over 150 patients of these children.\nSo, we have a good idea, Paul, where a number of these kids exist and then in certain cases, we will be finding as they get diagnosed at an increasing rate, as these studies that are now being offered, at least the sequencing tests being offered at a not for costs to all US centers I think are going to become the norm. We're quite comfortable that while they aren't single centers with very large numbers, they'll be good numbers around the US. Ian just wanted to add a comment.\nIan Mortimer -- President and Chief Financial Officer\nI'll just add a couple things. One comment is you're not seeing physicians that are seeing 8A patients versus the Q2 patients. So, these pediatric epileptologists, what we'd like to do is all the work we're doing with 496, if we're able to get into the 8A population with 901 is leverage all of the work we're doing with 496.\nSo, we would got to the same centers, the same investigators, and if they have new incident cases with these rare pediatric encephalopathies, if it's a Q2 diagnosis, then they can go into the 496 trial and if it's an 8A diagnosis, they can go into a 901 study if we get that feedback form the agency. I think there's a lot of leverage there that we can do.\nThe other thing that's interesting -- there's actually just been a recent paper that we think the incident of the 8A population is actually higher than maybe was thought previously. So, happy to point you in the direction of that publication. That's recently come out. We are seeing a higher rate of the diagnosis in the 8A population.\nPaul Matteis -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Managing Director\nThanks for the color.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Maury Raycroft of Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.\nUnknown Analyst -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHi. This is [inaudible] on for Maury. So, I had a couple of questions. You previously reported that in Phase 1, you do not see any dose-limiting toxicities and then you're planning to do more pre-clinical work to understand the therapeutic index better. I was just wondering if there is any more update on that. What happens if you do not see any valuable safety signals? How do you proceed in that case?\nSimon Pimstone -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt's an important question. We do have long-term toxicity as well as juvenile toxicity under way for 901. So, we'll see what the therapeutic indices may look like in the long-term six to nine-month studies as well as in the juvenile studies. Assuming we don't get MTD, which is the current situation with the Phase 1 clinical study, we will have a toxicity limitation.\nUltimately, we know we can go in the animal up to exposures that would be limiting in humans, even if we don't see tolerability concerns, we will have an exposure limitation based on the toxicity. We're quite comfortable that we can get high enough exposures in the animal studies to get a tox cat that would be hard to go above. So, we've still got some room in the clinic and of course, this does play into what the study design is going to be for both the pediatric and the adult.\nI think we have a fair idea of what our predicted effective dose and exposure looks like based on quite a significant amount of rodent data as well as some adults volunteer TMS data with 901. We know what the plasma exposures we achieved were that gave us a TMS signal. Those actually overlapped well with the predicted exposures from the MES rat assays.\nSo, we've got information both from in vivo studies as well as from the human TMS study that can help guide the predicted effective range and then the cap in the clinic in a Phase 2 setting will really be driven by the clinical toxicity. As I said, we've got long-term and juvenile toxicity under way that I think will help us submit that cap.\nUnknown Analyst -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGreat. That's helpful. Just one more question on 496 -- you mentioned that last time you wouldn't need any bioequivalence study to move forward. Is that still the case? Are there any more updates on that?\nSimon Pimstone -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. That's what we've just been discussing earlier with the prior question and in the updates, which is that with 496, it's not strictly a bioequivalence study because we don't have the equivalent drug, ezogabine, available today to test. But we have decided to do an adult PK study with the new drug product formulation.\nIt's a completely new formulation versus the old tablet ezogabine, but we thought it internally after a lot of discussion. Again, as I mentioned earlier, this was not based on FDA guidance, but we felt it was prudent to do the PK study with the new formulation so that we go into the FDA IND sufficiently informed and armed so that we can support the dosing proposal for the clinical study in these children with PK.\nHad we not done it and had we been left with this at risk, we felt it would have resulted in even longer delay if we were told to do it by the FDA after the submission. We think it makes sense. The guidance we've changed a little bit from Q3 to a Q4 Phase 3 start. It's probably a month or two. I think it would have been three to six months had we not done it somewhat in parallel.\nSo, this is the so-called bioequivalence study that you're referring to and it's not typically a bioequivalence because we're not testing it head to head to the other drug. It will be compared to a historical reference of ezogabine.\nUnknown Analyst -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nVery helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, that's * then 1 to ask a question. Our next question comes from David Martin of Bloom Burton. You may proceed with your question.\nDavid Martin -- Bloom Burton -- Managing Director\nSo, back to that study for 496, did you see anything unusual in the PK in the animal PK work that is making you do this?\nSimon Pimstone -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo. In fact, animal PK hasn't yet been run, Dave. We've got a number of prototypes on stability and being run through dissolution testing. We feel comfortable where we are, but we obviously have to finalize stability, make sure the prototype we select not only has the right type of dissolution profile but also has the right stability that includes term stability as well as accelerated stability. Those tests are still under way with multiple prototypes. We do expect we'll have the animal PK done this quarter, though, but none have been run so far.\nSo, no, this test was not driven off of any current concerns. It was driven off of the concern only and solely that the delay that might be incurred if the FDA were to require this was going to be longer than if we started the test sooner. So, that's why we've geared up to do it now. Because we don't need long-term stability for a CTA submission in Canada versus, of course, for an IND in the US, you need a minimum of one month, we can actually get going on this PK study outside of the US more rapidly. That's why we want to initiate that in the third quarter and we'll have the submission now at the IND with this data in Q4.\nDavid Martin -- Bloom Burton -- Managing Director\nOkay. The second question -- I think you had mentioned there was a possibility the new formulation for 496 might address a skin coloration issue. I'm wondering -- are you still thinking that might be the case or it's not on the table?\nSimon Pimstone -- Chief Executive Officer\nWe do believe that. We do expect we'll have quite significant presentations of this at some point. Obviously, for intellectual property purposes, we're not making disclosures on the improvements that we've made, but we do feel based on data we have to date, at least, that we can limit the production of this pigmentation liability with the new drug product that we developed. So, we still very firmly believe that we'll have that. Of course, we'll have novel IP around this formulation in how we get to the formulation, which should give us extensive protection commercially as well.\nI did want to also make the point because there had been a number of questions just on the PK and as you noted, we pushed the guidance out a little on the Phase 3 IND filing. This should not affect our topline read out. We haven't formally guided, but we don't believe in any way that moving a month or two out is going to impact topline readouts, which we're hoping and certainly aiming will be toward the end of next year.\nDavid Martin -- Bloom Burton -- Managing Director\nGreat. So, this reduction of the skin color, you're moving in the right direction? You're not moving away from it?\nSimon Pimstone -- Chief Executive Officer\nNot at all. No. Where we are today is completely consistent with what's been discussed in the past that we should have a drug product that has improved properties over the old ezogabine, not just in terms of the ability to administer to these young patients, these infants and young children, but also in terms of risk of pigmentation. We expect a lower liability.\nThat all being said, I think we've discussed before, David, and have certainly discussed publicly -- I think the whole pigmentation liability risk is a very different risk profile in these children as it was, perhaps, for a commercial entity in adult-focal epilepsy. We also note today the visual pigmentation, the retinal pigmentation has not resulted in visual toxicity, which of course was the major concern when this drug was launched and the label was placed on it.\nWe now know two things -- we know the pigmentation risk was cosmetic, which is still important, nonetheless, but it didn't result in toxicity, and secondly, every parent we've discussed this with and every KOL we've discussed this with for this indication, the pigmentation liability is not a concern.\nSo, while I think it's very important we do everything we can to dial it out, it will be important for commercial reasons to have a drug that doesn't turn blue and we think we can achieve that, I still think the old ezogabine even in its current form if the drug works, there's not going to be any significant commercial impact over the fact that it may cause pigmentation in some subjects. Remember, in addition -- in up to two years of dosing in children, not a single case of dosing was reported in pigmentation in these kids.\nNow, I think that's most likely because it wasn't just long enough dosed, but time will tell. All of this is to say we certainly are expecting to dial out the risk or minimize the risk, but even with the risk, I think the benefit to risk profile in this indication is very different than what was observed in the adults.\nDavid Martin -- Bloom Burton -- Managing Director\nYeah. I'm wondering if you might see some use of this in adult focal seizures.\nSimon Pimstone -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I don't know, it's certainly not something we'd promote, but something not something we would test. Of course, we're developing 1101 for that market. I think 1101 is better properties. In a few ways, it's not really excreted. So, the risk of renal urinary retention is negligible with 1101 and we know it affected about 1% of patients with ezogabine. And of course, the PK is another issue. So, I'm certainly hopeful that if patients wanted to get on or physicians wanted to get patients on a potassium channel opener for adult focal epilepsy, they'd be referred into our clinical trial of 1101 as opposed to 496.\nDavid Martin -- Bloom Burton -- Managing Director\nGot it. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jodi Regts for any further remarks.\nJodi Regts -- Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Investor Relations \nThank you.
