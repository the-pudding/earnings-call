With us today on the call, we have Mark Erickson, our Chairman and CEO, Matt Owens, the company's President, Rusty Kelley, our CFO, Tom Brock, our Chief Accounting Officer, and Eric Jacobsen, our SVP of Operations.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call, in addition to the aforementioned forward-looking statements also includes a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please be sure to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release and in our filing on form 10-Q which we provided earlier today after the close of trading.\n\nI'll now turn over the call to Mark Erickson, our CEO, to go through some highlights for this quarter.\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Louis. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. First, I would like to recap some of the outstanding achievements our team has made this year.\nWe still expect to grow our production by over 45% and we demonstrated the high productive potential within each of our Broomfield and Hawkeye areas. Our wholly owned midstream company, Elevation, is funded on a non-recourse basis requiring no capital outlays by the upstream company, exposing our shareholders to significant future upside.\nCurrently pipelines are being laid in Broomfield area, which is now fully permitted with development expected to commence in early 2019. We've been able to monetize over $150 million of assets.\nOur operations team continues to lead by example, setting a new milestone of over 1.2 million man hours without a single recordable employee incident, along with being awarded a Gold Leadership Award by Colorado in recognition for our efforts to go beyond compliance with state and federal environmental regulations, commitment to continual environmental improvement, and demonstrating leadership in partnering with local communities.\nFinally, we expect to achieve free cashflow in Q4 and expect to continue to grow our production base in 2019 while generating free cashflow for the year, excluding the impacts of Elevation Midstream.\nNow, I want to touch on the impressive results from our first pad of operated wells in the Broomfield area. Next, we'll talk about the difficulties we've been having related to constraints on the DCP system. After that, we'll open the call up to Q&A.\nIn late August, we started turning on a batch of ten wells with two-mile laterals testing spacing of 16 to 18 wells per section drilled on our Coyote Trails pad within our Broomfield project area. The pad's surface location sits in Weld County, but is producing our Broomfield County minerals.\nWe've always had very high hopes for this area, ranking the quality of this acreage potentially as a close second to our acreage in Greeley, which generates some of the absolute best returns anywhere in the lower 48. We're very pleased to show that early time, these wells are nicely exceeding our highest published type curves in both the Codell and Niobrara, performing almost on par with our Greeley wells.\nEach of these areas benefit from thick pays in the Codell and all benches of the Niobrara along with little past drainage due to very few vertical wells in either zone nearby. Referring to page 14 in our new investor presentation, you'll see the results from the Coyote Trails pad with the three Codell wells achieving average 60-day IP rates of 1,200 BOE per day, 68% of which is crude oil and 1,175 BOE per day for the seven Niobrara wells, 69% of which is oil.\nThese ten wells are still averaging over 1,100 BOE per day, which demonstrates the very flat production profile we've been seeing. The results from this pad are particularly important as they go a long way to demonstrating the potential of the 12,000 gross, 10,000 net acres we have in our Broomfield project area.\nOn this page in our investor presentation, you can see the production plots from several pads drilled by other operators that also show strong results. We've gotten all the necessary permits and the project is under way. Getting to this point took a lot of hard work from everybody involved, particularly those Broomfield staff and community volunteers who work so diligently with our team to develop this best in class development plan. I want to, again, thank everyone involved in the effort.\nNow, turning to the difficulties we've been experiencing on DCP's Midstream system. Shortly after DCP's Plant 10 came online, we were producing up to 93,000 BOE per day, until DCP imposed its production allocation. Our gross allocation represents about 13% of DCP's total capacity.\nIn mid-August after the plant came online, we were producing almost 220 million cubic feet per day gross on their system prior to being cut back by over 35%. So, as it stands today, we're planning to be limited to our current allocation until mid-2019 when Plant 11 comes online.\nFor the full year 2018, we estimate our net production will be constrained by approximately 17,000 BOE per day, net. After Plant 11 comes online, we expect that our allocation will only grow by approximately 30 million cubic feet per day based on the current allowable. Under this scenario, we believe we have ample existing base production to meet our allocation with relief expected in 2020 as our constrained wells go on natural decline.\nAs a result, we will be tailoring our investment in the DCP area to continue to meet our allocated production rate. We will continue to work on solutions with third parties for our non-dedicated and constrained production in this area. Further, we will continue directing our activity to our southern acreage, which is served by Anadarko's western gas and discovery, now part of Williams. Our diversified acreage position with access to multiple processing partners offers us a tremendous amount of flexibility not enjoyed by most other producers in the DJ basin.\nI would like to thank everyone for your time on the call today. Before we open it up for Q&A, I'd like to remind everybody that it's still election day. So, we don't have any results yet. Let's try to keep the questions focused on our results and plans rather than the election.\nWith that, Operator, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you do have a question, please press the * and the number 1 key on your touchstone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the # key.\nOur first question is from the line of Welles Fitzpatrick of SunTrust. Your line is open.\nWelles Fitzpatrick -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Managing Director\nHi, good afternoon. Can you talk a little -- obviously, the Coyote wells, they look like they can compete with just about anything in the basin. Can you give us a little bit more detail on maybe the pressure you're seeing? Are you seeing a significant pressure drawdown? I guess I'm just looking for any more color that might help us understand what those EORs might look like at the end of the day.\nMatt Owens -- President\nYeah, Welles. This is Matt. It's difficult to quantify exactly what that's going to be. Early on, those wells haven't really started declining yet, but their pressures have been a lot higher than what we normally see in our other areas, say, Windsor or in North Hawkeye. I would say they're not as strong as what we see in Greeley, but they're the closest wells we've seen so far to date pressure-wise compared to our Greeley asset.\nWelles Fitzpatrick -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Managing Director\nOkay. That makes sense. Then just one follow-on -- there's been some speculation of what to do with the free cashflow in '19 and about the potential for a buyback. Is that on the near-term to-do list for you guys or can you talk to how you might deploy that free cashflow?\nMatt Owens -- President\nWelles, our plan hasn't really changed from what we previously stated. Our first planned use of free cashflow is to get our net debt ratio inside of 1.5 and we would achieve that by paying down our RBL. Once we get that done, then all options will open for identifying and returning cash on the most advantageous way to shareholders.\nWelles Fitzpatrick -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Managing Director\nOkay. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.\nJeoffrey Lambujon -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is just a follow-up on Broomfield. I appreciate the comments on the pressure and the spacing configurations. Can you give any additional color on the completions recipe you utilize there and how it's different from what you've done in wells? Based on this first pad, are there any learnings or changes you'll apply to the go-forward program in 2019?\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So, we drilled 10 wells on this pad, testing about 16 to 18 wells per section. We had three in the Codell and seven in the Niobrara. We did do a few different completion techniques on these just to get everything tested early on and see how the results are comparing. The sand loading that we went with was anywhere from under 1,000 pounds per foot to up to 1,500 pounds per foot.\nWe also tried some slick water and some gel completions like we've done in some of our other areas. We do have a very wide array of completion tests going on with this pad and we'll be able to see if there's any differentiation in the production results once we get a few more months under our belt.\nJeoffrey Lambujon -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst\nGot it. My second question is just a clarifying one on DCP. It sounds like from the release and the commentary that the allocations that have been applied or essentially based on relative levels of production by operator from August of last year. I guess I first wanted to confirm that and second, I wanted to get your thoughts on if that's something they've communicated any interest in changing just given how it doesn't really give credit to the growth operators like yourselves and some of your peers that have delivered since that timeframe.\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThey were set based on August of 2017. That was a time period before our production ramp started. In addition to that, that was even before Grand Parkway was built as well as new compressor stations added. Obviously, the situation has changed substantially since then. During the time period between August and with the plant turning on, we obviously produced at rates much higher than that continually throughout the period.\nSo, we continue to have dialogue with DCP wrapped around what is the proper allocation method. But as you know in our budget, we haven't taken any of that into account. We've assumed that nothing changes.\nJeoffrey Lambujon -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHey, afternoon, everyone. You guys mentioned the 90 to 93 you produced at before you got the allocation from the DCP system. I was wondering if you could give some sort of indication or range as to what you're producing at now.\nMatt Owens -- President\nThat would be the 93 that we were up to total before we were curtailed back to the 13%. Now, I'd say we're closed to what you could imply for the Q4 volumes, which I believe is right around 78,000.\nBrad Heffern -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. Got it. And then looking at Hawkeye, I saw the updated zero time plots in the deck. Can you just talk about what you've been seeing on the performance there? Additionally, it looks like the longest history is sort of on the one-million-barrel type curve and then as time goes on, it sort of moves more toward the 900. I was wondering if that's the behavior that you would expect or if there was any color on why that would be the case.\nMatt Owens -- President\nYeah. We're seeing good results out of the North Hawkeye curves there in both the Niobrara and the Codell formations. We've got six wells there producing that make up those two lines. The South Hawkeye line is only made up of two wells, the one that we drilled about 20 months ago and then the second one that's got just about a year of production. One of the wells is performing a lot better than the other one.\nSo, I think that's what's bringing that curve down, but we will be drilling several more wells this quarter in the South Hawkeye area along with completing another seven-well pad in the North Hawkeye area testing both formations again. So, we'll have a lot more data points to add to this chart as Q1 rolls along.\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nBut we're pleased with the results that we're seeing today.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Irene Haas of Imperial Capital. Your line is open.\nIrene Haas -- Imperial Capital -- Managing Director\nYeah. Can we have a little color on your Broomfield project? Glad that it's finally happening. With your one rig, I suppose you'll be engaged in pad drilling. So, how does it synchronize with elevations, midstream buildout? I just want to have a rough timing as to how you put all the pieces together.\nMatt Owens -- President\nYeah. The midstream buildout is happening as we speak right now. Obviously, that's going to take place first as we lay pipelines in the right ways across the area where we'll be drilling our pads. We will start drilling in Broomfield full-time, coinciding the turning lines of those first pads with the turning lines when the pipelines are ready to go. So, first drilling will be in Q1 and then it will be a couple quarters after that for the wells to go through the cycle times of being turned in line.\nIrene Haas -- Imperial Capital -- Managing Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Your line is open.\nPaul Grigel -- Macquarie Group Limited -- Analyst\nI was hoping maybe you guys could discuss the thoughts on any impact to the reservoir or lack thereof on sustained ongoing midstream constraints over time.\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nI would point you to slide 13. I'll have Matt kind of talk through -- the Triple Creek is probably the best example of a highly constrained well or pad right now.\nMatt Owens -- President\nYeah. If you look at slide 13, where we have the Triple Creek pad on there. It's called out with the arrow. You can see how it was performing kind of in a straight line, but well below the type curves because it was choked back for several months. After about 240 days or so, you can see that line starting to change angle as we were able to open up those wells a little bit more when we saw some relief in line pressure.\nNow, after the first 360 days, we went from a decent amount below the 825,000-barrel curve to on track to pass that million-barrel curve on a cume basis shortly after this first year is up. So, we don't think we lost any reserves there and we're making that up rapidly now that we've been able to open up some of those wells.\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWe expect the same type of production profile for the C Street Pad as well.\nPaul Grigel -- Macquarie Group Limited -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. Thanks. Turning to the outlook on Plant 11 as you guys move to the south, is the view there that with existing production and wells that are waiting on completion for that area that you'll be able to sufficiently fill that up into 2020 and what ultimately do we need to see in 2020 to alleviate the problem in the north, in your view?\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, if there's no additional plant construction up there or for some reason the Plant 12 is delayed, we would be able to add production in the DCP system in 2020 as our wells go on natural decline. So, they should produce pretty flat until that 2020 time period with the base production that we have established.\nBut in addition, we continue to have ongoing discussions with third parties, private equity-backed that are adding plant and pipeline infrastructure in the northeast part of the field. Because we have a lot of uncommitted acreage in the area, we feel pretty strongly that we're going to be able to take advantage of that. We're just kind of waiting to see how things play out here over the next quarter or so to get firmer grip on the timing associated with those.\nPaul Grigel -- Macquarie Group Limited -- Analyst\nGreat. That's very helpful. Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Campbell -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst\nIt sounds like the 2019 investment is going to avoid overloading the DCP system for all the reasons you've already detailed. I was just wondering -- is that a full-year strategy or do you expect some second half '19 relief when O'Connor comes online?\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWe're going to pick up. If our allocation remains at 13%, we pick up about 13% of the new plant that comes online, which would be about $30 million a day net to our interests. We've accounted for that in our 2019 guidelines. The biggest relief that we could see of anything that could change, whether it be '19 or '20 would be incremental processing capacity in the area beyond Plant 11.\nJeffrey Campbell -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst\nOkay. My other question is kind of a capital allocation question as well. It sounds like you're going to target investment in the south. I was just wondering if you've got any color about how you're going to do that around the elevation midstream buildout. I assume it's going to have some effect on both Broomfield and Hawkeye investment.\nMatt Owens -- President\nYeah. We do have acreage that is outside of the elevation buildout area that we can drill that would include some western gas processing or some other discovery processing that can go straight to the plant before the CGF is done being built and then hooked in later. We're carefully planning our drill and completion timeline around that buildout.\nJeffrey Campbell -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. Thanks. I appreciate that color.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jacob Gomolinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJacob Gomolinski-Ekel -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking questions and congrats on the nice Broomfield results. I guess it was a little bit maybe visually shocking to see the August production versus where you came in for the quarter due to the DCP curtailments and their decision to use that August 2017 production data to determine allocations.\nI think in your last answer you hinted at -- you said if our allocation remains at 13%. Is there any room for negotiation with DCP and how they're making these allocation decisions? It sounds like I don't know if the August 2017 date was arbitrary. It seems a little misaligned if the goal was to focus on single-basin producers incentive to grow.\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nTo say we were surprised by that pick of a date is an understatement, especially during the same time period when -- throughout 2018, we were in close communication with DCP. None of the discussions we had with them led us to believe there would be any allocations associated with the new plant. Historically, it's not the way they've operated. Then to have them come out and put allocations on the system after they told us there would be no allocations and we made our investment decisions based upon that, we were very, very surprised.\nIt's safe to say, though, at this point, we're not going to stretch our necks out again based on what we think DCP will do or not do, which is why I would say we've taken the most -- we're saying that we don't expect to get anything greater than the 13%.\nJacob Gomolinski-Ekel -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. You've obviously got a carrot and a stick given you have your own elevation system and can move those CapEx dollars elsewhere?\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWe do.\nJacob Gomolinski-Ekel -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nI appreciate the request not to talk about the vote, but you did say talking about the plans and I know we'll get the results later. Maybe just hypothetically if the vote were to pass, could you speak to your long-term plans and how you would look to -- just thinking about your options, would you be looking to diversify out of basin, similar to PDCE or would you develop what you have and then go into run-off mode or are there other options maybe the investor community is not currently thinking about that we should be?\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWe talked about this quite a bit. I'm going to have Matt walk through some specific numbers. Going into this election starting over a year ago, we started building a significant number of permits in the Basin. In fact, I think we hold the highest number of permits in the basin and the highest number of permits in the core of the basin. We feel very strongly that all those will be grandfathered through.\nSo, getting in at some specifics, we expect that our PDP at the end of this year will be substantially higher than our debt and that we'll have a very high inventory of permits. Matt will go through the specific numbers. We look at our equity value today as it has to assume a worst case scenario in the election with a substantial discount attached to it. Matt, do you want to talk about our permitting strategy and where we're at today?\nMatt Owens -- President\nYeah. We've been very active for about a year now, like Mark said, with our permitting strategy. We've secured in hand over 400 permits approved in the quarter of our acreage position with an additional 400 permits pending. So, we believe we still could get some permits approved over the next 40 days, but regardless, we should have about three years, if not slightly more of drilling inventory at a three-rig pace and also that could increase depending on what we're able to get through in the next 30 days.\nThen outside of that, we do have about another 100, slightly over that approved permits in our northern extension area. So, we have quite a long runway of inventory if there are any legal issues that ensue after tonight's vote.\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd also appreciate that these permits are located in some of our highest-value areas. We're talking about Greeley, Broomfield, Hawkeye -- these are the areas that yield the highest NPVs per location in our whole inventory.\nJacob Gomolinski-Ekel -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. That's really helpful. Thanks for all the color and good luck tonight.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, this does conclude the question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark Erickson for any closing remarks.\nMark Erickson -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, everybody for participating in the call today. If you're from Colorado and haven't voted, please load up your stuff and head up to the polls right now. We need every vote we can get. Thanks.
