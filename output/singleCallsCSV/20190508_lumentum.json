Alan? Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be here discussing our third-quarter results and progress on achieving our strategic goals. The third quarter continued the theme that started more than a year ago. For the fifth quarter in a row, strong demand for our new products drove double-digit quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in ROADMs and fiber lasers. Once again, we attained new record revenue levels for both of these product lines. With a full quarter of contribution from the Oclaro acquisition, our telecom revenue mix is now approximately 40% transmission and 60% transport. This is more balanced when compared to Lumentum's historically heavy transport mix and is closer to the overall telecom market. This mix could further balance out over time as new higher-speed transmission products, including DCO modules, ramp later this year. We believe the telecom market should be strong based on the continued growth in global network bandwidth requirements and the needed infrastructure for 5G. We are well positioned to capitalize on these trends with our industry-leading transmission and transport products. During the third quarter, we announced to our telecom customers two strategic actions catalyzed by the Oclaro acquisition. First, we are rationalizing overlapping product lines, which we expect to have minimal impact to revenue. This rationalization should result in gross margin improvement once completed over the next few quarters. Second, we are discontinuing some legacy telecom product lines where growth and profitably forecasts are inconsistent with our long-term goals. Revenue from these products is approximately $15 million per quarter at present and will decline to zero once we satisfy our customers' last time buy needs over the coming three to four quarters. In early March, at the OFC tradeshow, we announced a fundamental shift in our datacom strategy. We are now focused on datacom chip sales and will stop selling datacom transceivers over time. We also announced the sale of several of our datacom transceiver product lines to Cambridge Industries Group, or CIG. This transaction closed on April 18, 2019. We expect sales of our remaining datacom transceiver product lines to ramp down to zero as we bleed down inventory with only chip sales remaining in the future. We are trying to do this as quickly as possible, but this process could take up to four to five quarters. Currently, datacom chip revenues are approximately $20 million per quarter. Since the announcement of the transaction and our clarification on our datacom strategy, we have seen increased interest from new customers for our datacom chips as we will no longer compete with them at the transceiver level. We are investing in new datacom chip development and expect sales of chips to customers serving the datacom and 5G markets to grow over time. Since our last earnings call, we have made good progress on winning 3D sensing business for future product cycles. Customers around the world know they can count on our proven and unrivaled reliability and volume capability. The market for laser-based sensing is still in the early innings. We believe the market opportunity over the long run is tremendous as the applications that use our 3D sensing lasers enhance security, safety and new functionality in the billions of electronic devices that people around the world rely on every day. We believe our leadership position in the market is sustainable, and we will see strong growth in our 3D sensing business over the long run. We have shipped hundreds of millions of devices with unmatched performance, quality and reliability. This experience is a valuable advantage and is difficult for our competitors to replicate and overcome. Turning to the third-quarter results. Revenue was $432.9 million, up 16% quarter on quarter driven by having a full quarter of revenue from the Oclaro acquisition as well as continued strong growth in telecom transport products and commercial lasers. 3D sensing revenue declined quarter-on-quarter seasonally as expected. Revenue from our telecom product lines grew 41% sequentially, again driven by the acquired telecom revenue and by strong double-digit quarter-on-quarter growth in ROADMs and telecom transport sales. Demand from our customers for our telecom products is very strong and is spread across a broad customer and geographical base. Chinese customers are increasing -- are an increasing portion of our ROADM revenue, which should be expected given the limited historical deployments of ROADMs in China. However, their contribution is still well below their share of the market. We continue to add ROADM capacity, but demand outstripped our ability to supply in the third quarter, and this will continue throughout the fourth quarter. We believe the growth in our ROADM and transport revenue has outpaced the telecom transmission revenue growth for several reasons. One simply relates to timing. In new network deployments, the transport equipment is installed first, and then individual transmission wavelengths are lit up over time. The other reason for strong ROADM growth are -- the other reasons for strong ROADM growth are more fundamental and long term in nature. The new Colorless, Directionless and Contentionless, or CDC network architectures, the ROADM -- the number of ROADMs per network node and the number of ports per ROADM and, therefore, the average selling price is increasing. These more advanced ROADMs enable customers to achieve the needed network reconfigurability and capacity. Additionally, ROADMs are pushing into new geographies and applications. Earlier, I discussed China, which has historically not deployed ROADMs domestically. Chinese domestic deployments have started, which significantly increases the addressable market over time. In terms of new applications, we are seeing ROADMs push further toward the edge of the network replacing fixed optical add-drops. Switching to telecom transmission. We continue to make progress on our high-speed coherent products, including indium phosphide photonic integrated circuit-based components, 200-gigabit DCO modules and future 400-gigabit and 1.2-terabit DCO products. We expect these products to ramp in volume and to be a growth driver later this year. Turning to our industrial and consumer product lines, which includes 3D sensing. As expected, third-quarter revenue was down 35% quarter on quarter, driven by usual seasonality in the consumer electronics market. We continue to make excellent progress with Android customers and additional new design wins on both front- and world-facing applications. For the first time, we had a single Android customer drive more than $10 million of revenue in the quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect 3D sensing to be flat to slightly down, driven by seasonality on existing products not being fully offset by initial ramps for new product cycles. Given our current mix of customer opportunities and historical trends, our fourth quarter should be the seasonal low of 3D sensing revenue. We expect 3D sensing to ramp up again this summer and into the fall time frame. Our commercial laser segment revenue was up 14% quarter on quarter. During the third quarter, we benefited from capacity expansion and further ramped volumes of our newest fiber laser products to meet strong customer demand. We again achieved record revenues from our Kilowatt-Class Fiber Lasers, which grew 23% sequentially and 135% relative to the same period the prior year. Also of note is the significant improved -- significantly improved gross margin for our laser segment. We have made significant strides in product cost reduction. Contributing to this, we moved pump laser production to our new facility in Thailand, which is achieving lower cost than our prior manufacturing location. We are making healthy investments in new laser product development targeting higher-growth material processing applications. Over the long run, we believe we have good opportunities for growth, driven by new product introductions. In the fourth quarter, however, we expect laser's revenue to decline from the third-quarter levels. Our largest fiber laser customer has communicated that their inventory of our products has reached targeted levels. Throughout my remarks, I have highlighted significant long-term trends that create terrific market opportunities for Lumentum. Further, I've highlighted our strategy to accelerate growth and drive sustainable margin expansion and customer and end market diversification. It is a very exciting time at Lumentum for all of our stakeholders. I will now hand it over to Wajid.Wajid Ali -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. I'm very happy to be here on my first earnings call after joining Lumentum. I will first run through the third-quarter financial results, add some additional details around the Oclaro acquisition, and then provide our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. Net revenue for the third quarter was $432.9 million. GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 20.4%. GAAP operating margin was negative 17.6%, and GAAP diluted net loss per share was $0.98. Compared with prior periods, our GAAP numbers were significantly impacted by charges related to the Oclaro acquisition, including restructuring and asset writedowns related to product line exits. Third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 39%, which was down by 110 basis points from the prior quarter due to product mix. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 17.8%. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled 91.8 million or 21.2% of revenue and increased 24.3 million due to having the full quarter of the acquired business, as well as the seasonal impact of new calendar year resets of labor fringe rates. R&D expense was 52.8 million. SG&A expense was 39 million. Non-GAAP net income was 69.9 million for the third quarter and includes 3.8 million of net interest expense and tax expense of 3.3 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share was $0.91 based on a fully diluted share count of 76.7 million. Turning to segment and product line details. Our optical communications segment revenue at $377.9 million increased 16% sequentially. Within our optical communications segment, telecom revenue at 243.4 million was up 41% sequentially. Datacom revenue at 57.3 million was up 72% sequentially. Industrial and consumer revenue at 77.2 million was down 35% sequentially due to lower 3D sensing revenues in the quarter. Optical Communications segment gross margin at 38% decreased 170 basis points sequentially due to lower industrial and consumer and the revenue mix. Our laser segment revenue at 55 million increased 14% sequentially, driven by growth in fiber laser sales. Third-quarter lasers' gross margin was 46% and increased 330 basis points due to higher volumes and product cost reductions. Cash and short-term investments totaled 697.5 million at the end of the third quarter. Capital additions during the third quarter were 31 million. Now turning to more details on the acquisition expense synergies. As highlighted when we announced the acquisition, we expected synergies would be in excess of $60 million per year within 12 to 24 months from the close of the transaction. During the third quarter, we have achieved more than $20 million in annual expense synergies. We expect synergies to continue to grow in the fourth quarter and into fiscal year '20. Now onto our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Noting again that all projections are on a non-GAAP basis. We project net revenue for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 405 to 425 million. This revenue projection includes telecom increasing, driven by continued market growth and capacity expansion. Datacom decreasing by 20 million to 25 million due to the product line divestiture that was completed earlier in the quarter and continuing declines in remaining datacom transceiver sales. Commercial lasers decreasing 15 to 20%, driven by the factors Alan mentioned earlier. And industrial and consumer, which contains 3D sensing, to be slightly down due to seasonal factors. We project fourth quarter operating margin to be in the range of 18 to 20%, and diluted net income per share to be in the range of $0.85 to $1. These projections incorporate an approximate share count of 77 million. In this guidance, we are benefiting from synergies attained to-date. We are projecting higher operating margins on lower revenues. This is despite lower revenue from our higher-than-average margin 3D sensing and commercial lasers product lines. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jim to start the Q&A session.Jim Fanucchi -- Investor Relations, Darrow Associates Thanks, Wajid. [Operator instructions] Operator, let's begin with the question-and-answer session. \n\n\n\n\nQuestions & Answers: OperatorYes, sir. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst Thank you very much for taking the questions. I wanted to start out with, kind of, picture on what you see going on in the 3D market longer term beyond that one quarter guidance. And maybe to help frame that. So if we think about the full-year calendar '19, do you expect it to be a growth year versus calendar '18? And in terms of the context of the trends, how do you think the mix is trending between Android and non-Android phones over sort of the next, let's say, one year or so? And I have a follow up.Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, Simon, this is Alan. I think it's hard for us to tell the mix between Android and non-Android revenue mix out into the future because it's very, very dependent upon what phones and what devices the 3D sensing gets put on and whether or not those are high volume or not. I think the data point that we shared in the script was that we have an Android customer that was more than $10 million in sales last quarter trying to indicate that we are in the Android business, and they are adopting 3D sensing and again, in the very, very early stages. So I expect that 3D sensing for Android customers will grow more rapidly than it has in the past as we look out over the next four quarters. So year over year, Chris, do you have a view on calendar '19 versus calendar '18?Chris Coldren -- Senior Vice President of Business Development Certainly. We think it will be up year over year given expectations around the second half of this year. We feel that in calendar '19, obviously, there were some challenges in various smartphone supply chains that impacted demand. And our expectations are that those be cleaned up and hopefully we will be shipping more in line with customer volumes versus customer [Inaudible]. Did that answer your question?Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst Yes. It does. Very helpful. And I just wanted to maybe get level set on how to think about operating expenses over the longer term. In your March quarter, your reported quarter, your gross margin was better than expected, but your operating expenses were higher. And it could be just simply how we're allocating after the Oclaro deal. So you've got a number of moving parts with the cost synergies going on. Is there maybe some way to help us think about what would be a normalized or sort of fiscal '20 kind of opex expectation post synergies?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I mean I think going forward, as Wajid said, we've realized about $20 million of synergies since the acquisition was completed. I would say that probably half of those are in opex and half of those are in operating expense -- COGS. And that moving forward, the additional will be also shared between COGS and operating expenses. We did make some major announcements, for instance, closing our lithium niobate fab in Italy. We communicated that to the employees. And that shows up in our GAAP numbers for fiscal Q3, but won't show up in the savings or synergies until we actually cease operation, which would be late this calendar year. So I think we're going to continue to see operating expenses come down. At the same time, we'll see COGS come down to realize those synergies.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst And so June opex may be down a little bit from March, but then further declines later in the year?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, I think so. I think we'll see operating expenses down in the June quarter from the March quarter.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst Great. Thank you for taking the questions.OperatorOur next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Yeah, thanks for taking the question, guys. I wanted to start -- I think we heard you say that you have 20 million in chip revenue for datacom. I just want to confirm that you said that. And kind of get an idea for how that revenue goes in the future. And could you also confirm if that is well above group average gross margin revenue? And then I've got a follow-up to that.Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. We said it was approximately $20 million today. We expect that to grow over time. I think two things. One is, now that we've sold a set of product lines to CIG, they've become a chip customer, and we'll start seeing that growth in chip revenue from that base of 20 million a quarter. And then as we also said, now that we're not a transceiver competitor, that actually opens up the market for us to sell more chips going forward to competitors -- what used to be viewed as competitors. So we expect that chip revenue to grow steadily over time. And it is above the average gross margin, as you would expect, on a chip basis than the corporate group's margin average.Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. And then I wanted to see -- could you guys just comment on what's going on with inventory in China? And kind of -- it would be nice to know what your own inventory exposure looks like there? In other words, is it mostly ROADMs? Or is there sort of normal spread of other components in that inventory? And then where do you think the risk of that is given the trade situation?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Well, I don't know what's going to happen with the trade situation. I was in China a few weeks ago. And I'll tell you that given the amount of pressure that was put on me by our customers, in particular for ROADMs and pumps, I'd say that there is not a buildup of inventory, and that deployments are happening. And anecdotally, I was told about several greenfield deployments throughout China that are utilizing our more -- most advanced twin one by 32, one by 35 ROADMs, as well as our MxN that are being deployed today. So those are new products that we're just ramping over the last couple of quarters. So there's not a big buildup of inventory there. We are also shipping, now with the acquisition under our belt, a lot of transmission products. And again, I don't see a lot of inventory buildup there in our most advanced products. And so I don't think given that we have been on constrained -- we have been constrained in our ability to meet demand, I don't believe there's a big buildup of the inventory that we provide to our customers in China.Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK great. Thanks, Alan.Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Rod.OperatorYour next question comes from Alex Henderson of Needham. Your line is open.Alex Henderson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst I wanted to ask first about the industrial lasers being down 15 to 20% quarter-to-quarter. That puts it around -- at the midpoint around 47 million. Is that -- is the spike to $55 million and then the decline back to 47 a function of them flushing out some inventory, having orders in hand and then ending up with a little bit more inventory? And this is the new run rate? Should we be seeing 47% flat to growing modestly off of that? Or is the spike down in the quarter just a temporary vowel as they bring some inventory down? How do we think about the sequential next couple quarters on that business?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer I'd say that, as we've said in the past earnings calls, we've had trouble catching up with demand and filling the supply chain at our leading customer for fiber lasers. So we have been shipping more in than they've been shipping out as they fill up their production line, which is not a one-week production cycle time. So they have several weeks of production, once they receive our fiber laser engine, go into their production line and ship out and put on a boat. And so, there's a long cycle of inventory that we have not been able to catch up to until March. And so now we're more shipping in to what they're shipping out, and we will ship in more as they convert more of their tools to fiber lasers from CO2, which they've been reluctant to do in the past because we weren't able to meet their demand. So I'd say that it's an equilibrium of in and out from a inventory standpoint, but as now they have more confidence in our ability to produce what they need, they'll continue to convert more and more of their tools away from CO2 lasers to our fiber laser. I think we should start seeing a pickup. Assuming the global economic conditions of the world maintain at a stable level, we should start seeing a pickup in a couple of quarters as that conversion happens.Alex Henderson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst OK. As a follow-up, the other piece of the equation here is on the capacity additions in ROADMs and pumps. So obviously, you moved to Thailand on pumps. I assume that you're capacity constrained on both of those as those lines ramp up. Can you talk a little bit about the timing of when you have additional slugs of capacity coming on in those critical product areas?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. For pumps, we started production last quarter in our Thailand facility. And as you may remember, several quarters ago, we actually just added incremental capacity to be able to bring up Thailand without impacting our manufacturing in Shenzhen, China. So we brought that up this quarter. We're doing sizable quantities of pumps in Thailand as we ramp down our production in Shenzhen. Production in Shenzhen will stop this quarter -- by the end of this quarter, and we will move that capacity to Thailand to bring up the capacity to the full run rate. At the same time, we were trying to build up inventory of pumps in Shenzhen, and we just were not able to meet the kind of demand that we saw until we are constrained still on pumps, but expect as we bring up our capacity over the next couple of quarters in Thailand and have it totally be based in Thailand, that we'll have an incremental probably 20 to 30% over our run rate peak that we saw a few quarters ago given that we added capacity a year ago to be able to not disturb the production in China. As far as the ROADMs are concerned, we continue to add capacity every quarter, mostly on the one by 20s, one by 35s, twins and the MxNs. And so that's where our real fundamental growth is coming from moving forward. But at the same time, we are constrained actually on the -- our new low-cost one by nine that we saw more and more demand and more and more ROADMs pushing to the edges. I talked about replacing these fixed add-drop multiplexers. And so, I think we're going to continue to see growth in our ROADM revenues, at least for the foreseeable future from what I can tell, given that the ASPs are shifting upward, the complexity of the ROADMs are adding ASPs, and we're getting more units out. And so, we should see that happening both in Q4, as well as through the balance of the calendar year.Alex Henderson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst If I could just follow up on this piece of it. So pumps are obviously enormously important for amps. Amps are important for ROADMs. Are you able to produce enough pumps and amps to produce the amount of ROADMs you want to produce? Is that a gating factor on this? And if so, are you selling any pumps externally? How should we think about the availability of pumps to sell beyond what's needed internally?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I mean obviously, we prioritize our internal blade -- super-blade modules and the likes of those more highly integrated subsystems for our pumps. But we are shipping both to record level numbers and -- of revenue for external pump customers. It just wasn't enough. And so we are still selling individual pumps to pump customers, but just weren't able to satisfy all the demand in Q3 and expect that over the next few quarters, as we continue to ramp up Thailand, we'll be able to catch up with that demand for pumps.Operator[Operator instructions] Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis. I just wanted to get a little more color here with all the divestitures and selling of businesses. What do you guys think longer term about the margin profile? Obviously, guiding into June here, you're seeing flattish margins but at lower revenue. But longer term, what do you think that looks like? And how does that drive earnings growth?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So our operating margin last quarter in Q3 was 17.8%. We guided on lower revenue and a less favorable mix to 18 to 20% operating margins. So I'd say that we are continuing to drive operating margins in what I would call our seasonally weakest quarter of the year. And so, we're going to continue to see that operating margin growth as we expect our 3D sensing business to really pick up in the second half of the calendar year. And I'd say that we'll be north of 20 points of operating margin as that mix becomes more favorable. So I'd say we're on track. We're going to continue to realize those synergies. We've only gotten $20 million out of the synergies, and we expect that to continue through the next several quarters.Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst Great. And then just a little more color on Android in the quarter. You guys said one customer was $10 million. The first part is, did you guys have multiple 10% customers in the quarter? And then the second part is, how much was the total contribution from Android? I guess, better way to say that is, how much was outside of that one $10 million?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer I mean, we do have other Android customers. We were just trying to make a point that Android now is a more significant portion of our overall 3D sensing business, and that we expect that to grow quite rapidly. We don't break out individual customers that are 10% of a given product line. We break it out once a year in our K as far as 10% customers for that year. So beyond that, we're not going to break out much more detail.OperatorYour next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JP Morgan. Your line is open.Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on Alex's earlier question about ROADM capacity. Alan, if -- can you give us some sense of, as you've increased capacity on ROADMs, how has your primary competitor reacted in terms of capacity addition? I guess, what I'm trying to get to is, once the tailwinds from China moderate maybe one or two years out, how do we get comfort that the industry is not in a overcapacity situation at that point in relation to ROADMs?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think there's a couple of underlying changes that are different from past cycles where we had five or six competitors buying for the same ROADM slots. And now we have a very concentrated, competitive landscape. And at the same time, the transition from simpler one by nine-type ROADMs to very complex high port count and CDC-type ROADMs give me confidence that we're going to continue to push the technology and continue to have that leadership on providing our customers what they need, what they want, when they want it. I think as I've said also that we are in the very, very early stages of deployment in China. We're seeing strong growth across the globe on our higher port count and CDC-type ROADM architectures. And so I don't have a crystal ball to say what's going to happen two years from now, but I'd say that we're still not able to satisfy the demand, the orders -- firm orders that we have for this quarter and see that being constrained even as we add 10% of ROADM revenue every quarter for the last five quarters. So we expect that to be constrained for the next quarter or two.Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst OK. Got it. Can I just quickly --Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer As far as our competitors are concerned, I think we believe we have a few years lead on the technology and the kind of architectures that our customers are asking for. And we're continuing to invest more and more R&D dollars into making sure we keep that transport leadership, especially in ROADMs.Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Got it. I just wanted to quickly follow up on the synergy targets here. I mean you've got 20 million in kind of the first quarter that you fully consolidated Oclaro. How do we kind of think of the upside here on the 60 million target that you have, like 24 months out from -- do we look at kind of potentially some upside to that 60 million?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I mean I think as we start realizing the synergies, what we're updating whether or not we think we can get more, I think what we said when we announced the deal and we're very confident that we would exceed $60 million of synergies. We're still confident of doing that. Some of the synergies come in chunks. And as I've said before, we notified our employees in Italy that we're closing that lithium niobate fab. But we're running it hot right now to buildup inventory to satisfy our customer's lifetime buy requirements. And then by the end of this calendar year, we'll start seeing the synergies resulting from that decision. So in the December quarter, we should see a pickup -- beginning to pick up from that kind of a synergy, as well as we're still working on our ERP consolidation, moving to Oracle from what was -- what is an Oracle and SAP environment. And once that happens, then it'll be probably early part of next calendar year, we'll see another chunk of synergies as a result of that. So it's not going to be a smooth 5 or $10 million a quarter. We'll see it come over time, probably over the next four or five quarters.Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Thanks. Thanks for the call.OperatorYour next question comes from John Marchetti of Stifel. our line is open.John Marchetti -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Thanks very much, Alan., I was hoping maybe you could spend a minute or two on that ROADM demand outside of China. A lot of focus obviously there on not only some of the greenfield opportunities but as they're putting in that technology for the first time. I'm wondering if you can comment a little bit on what you're seeing sort of rest of world, North American and some of the other geographies as that's more of an upgrade situation given that they've had that technology deployed for some time?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer You mean outside of China?John Marchetti -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Yes.Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Well, I wouldn't say that there is a whole lot of people that have existing ROADM networks that have twin two by 35s or MxN architectures installed. And so, I'd say that those are new opportunities for new greenfields. And whether that be in Japan, we're seeing a lot of demand for L band ROADMs and the infrastructure that supports L band. So Japan is actually doing quite well. North America is doing well, Europe is doing well. And we're engaged with our customers on next-generation ROADM blades and Super Transport Blades around these new high port count ROADM architecture and CDC architectures, both in C and L band. So I'd say that our R&D and new product introduction pipeline is quite full to address the global market. And so, these new ROADM architectures are required as the network speeds become faster and faster, and in preparation for the 5G rollout. I really do think that there is infrastructure spend happening today in anticipation of 5G coming to market over the next several years.John Marchetti -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. And then maybe if I can ask a similar question on the laser side. In terms of outside your largest customer, what you're seeing there and the potential for new customers to come on? And maybe how the current sort of economic backdrop, particularly in Asia, may be impacting that? And then how we can think about that going forward in terms of broadening out that base of demand for the laser business?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. When we talked about our largest customer, we're talking about our largest customer for fiber lasers. Is your question specific around fiber laser or our commercial laser business in general?John Marchetti -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst I think both to be fair, Alan. Just trying to see what kind of gets that business back up on a more consistent growth trajectory as it's been a little bit lumpier over these last several quarters?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer OK. Yes. So I'd say there is really two dynamics. One is in the micromachining, and that is cyclical within a year around consumer electronics. And so, I'd say that tools get installed now in the first half of the year in anticipation of consumer electronics demand in the second half of the year. So typically, our micromachines or nanosecond pulse, our ultrafast lasers have a better first half of the calendar year than second half. We've seen slow impact in the first half. And so, we're not expecting a big pickup on that in the short term, although we're investing -- we're increasing our R&D spend in lasers significantly to get out in front of new product requirements for ultrafast laser. So we expect that in calendar '20 that business should pick up as a result of new material processing for glass cutting and other kinds of materials that use the ultrafast lasers. On the fiber lasers, we have been over the last 10 years very, very closely partnered with Amada. They continue to be our priority. But now as we've caught up on the demand, we are branching out to see what we can do to drum up other business in our fiber lasers area. And so, I wouldn't say there is any short-term pickup that you should model into your models in the next couple of quarters. But I would say end of the calendar year and into calendar year '20, we should see that broadening of our customer base on fiber lasers.OperatorYour next question comes from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thanks. I just wanted to kind of get some context for how you are thinking about the DCO ramp, kind of, into the second half of the year. And just where you are with kind of testing product? Or how long you think customers will need to test product before that product ramps? And then maybe second question, just on the datacom business. It would seem as if you would no longer kind of have any direct relationship with the hyperscalers given the move more into the chipset business. And just wanted to kind of see is that correct? Or just where you would intend or plan on kind of engaging directly with the hyperscalers kind of going forward?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, I'd say that from being a chip supplier, we are still very, very engaged with the hyperscalers. In fact, some of them actually are our chip customers. And so, I think that that's going to intensify as we work with our transceiver customers to make sure that we're providing the right photonic chipsets to go with their ICs that make the transceivers. And so, I think we're actually being viewed as more the independent provider of the technology to the hyperscalers. And so, I would think that that relationship with hyperscalers would actually increase as opposed to decrease on the datacom side. From a DCO standpoint, we're sampling customers now, and we expect that assuming that goes well and I don't see any reason why it shouldn't go well, that we should start seeing revenue in our first calendar -- first fiscal quarter of FY '20. And then the ramp is going to really be dependent upon how those qualifications go. And so, I'd hate to say that we're going to count on tens of millions of dollars in the second half, but I think that there is certainly a desire by our customers to qualify us and have a viable second source to the lead guy producing DCOs today.Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Got it. Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh of UBS. Your line is open.Tejas Venkatesh -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you. Given the positive commentary we've heard from you on Android 3D sensing so far on this call, I wonder if you might comment on whether we should expect to see high-volume Android phones with 3D sensing on it? And then how much of the Android revenue so far has been time-of-flight VCSELs versus structured light?Chris Coldren -- Senior Vice President of Business Development Yes. So Tejas, this is Chris. I think you can expect certainly at a single customer driving more than $10 million a quarter, that that's now starting to get to -- not quite lead customer volumes, but is getting to reasonable volumes. Our discussions with other Android customers are leading us to believe that as we exit this calendar year and into the new calendar year, there is opportunity for, I think, what you would classify as more of a higher-volume Android model. As you imagine, it's a dynamic market, and customers are somewhat secretive with their product plans. But I think that the time window that today relate this calendar year and our next calendar year is the best opportunity for something that becomes multiples of where the kind of opportunities are today in the market. In terms of time-of-flight, we've got a reasonable mix. I would say a lot of the revenue today is time-of-flight. One of the main drivers for that is, many of the Android customers are focused on world-facing phones or world-facing 3D sensing in their phones today, and time-of-flight is the technology of choice for world-facing applications. So we've got a pretty healthy mix of time-of-flight and structured light customers.OperatorYour next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies. Your line is open.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst I wanted to go back to the discussion of ROADM and ROADM capacity. I think you mentioned 10% capacity additions over the last five quarters. I was just curious about why aren't we able to ramp that ROADM capacity a bit faster. And I realize it's a very testing-intensive process, the production of ROADMs. But I'm just wondering if there's any opportunity here to ramp capacity in a faster way. And then also, I'm wondering on -- from a ROADM technology perspective, are you seeing any more activity around flex grid?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So just a couple things. So on -- we call our flexible grid TrueFlex. And I'd say that last quarter, over 90% of our ROADM shipped are all TrueFlex and expect that to be the case moving forward. I didn't say that we were only getting 10%. I'd say that over the last five quarters, we've gotten a minimums of 10%. And if you look back two quarters ago, we grew more like 25%. And so we are adding capacity as fast as we can, but we're now getting into big numbers. And so, adding 10% on a $100 million is more significant than adding 10% on $20 million. And so those capacity increases come in two ways. One is improving productivity and yield over time, and that comes out of just the existing capacity. But when we add capacity, they normally come in, in chunks of capacity additions for a given product line. And so that's when you see a big step up of ROADM capacity. But again, getting 10 to $15 million of additional ROADM revenue out in a quarter is nontrivial, and we're trying to just keep up with demand and haven't been able to do so so far.Chris Coldren -- Senior Vice President of Business Development I think also it's useful to point out that it takes three to six months often to add capacity. And so, capacity that's coming online today is based on decisions several quarters ago. And if the market is continuing to inflect upwards, it's a little more challenging to handicap where it's going to be and what we have to do today, where is it going to be in six months. And we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, and that's why we've been in a capacity-constrained situation here in the past year, year and a half on ROADMs.Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer And just one other data point. Year over year, ROADM growth is approximately 80%. So it's pretty good team by -- pretty good job by the team to add that kind of capacity over a four-quarter period.OperatorYour next question comes from Michael Genovese of MKM Partners. Your line is open.Michael Genovese -- MKM Partners -- Analyst Great. Thanks. I was just hoping you would walk us through this datacom divestiture again. So I think you're guiding down in datacom 20 million post the divestiture for the quarter. But if you could walk us through the steps in the quarter beyond that? And then secondly, just from your perspective, because I don't really track everybody's research out there. But in terms of the 20 million for next quarter, what percentage of sell-side analysts do you think change numbers after the divestiture?Chris Coldren -- Senior Vice President of Business Development I would say we probably saw about five sell-side analysts, a couple in the past two days. So fairly few incorporated the divestiture in census going into our press release.Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer And as far as your question on how should you look at datacom going forward. Last quarter, we did 57 million in datacom. Our guidance said that you should take 20 to 25 out this quarter, and we had three weeks of all the datacom business in as we divested on April 18. And again, so if you look at 32 to $37 million of datacom revenue, of which 20 million-ish is chip sales in Q4, I'd say that chip sales should go up over time. But the transceivers of that 12 to 17 million will go to zero over three to five quarters and then a pretty straight line.Michael Genovese -- MKM Partners -- Analyst Great. Great. And then my follow-up. There's been a lot of discussion of ROADM capacity, but I just sort of want to add -- ask straight out because I'm still confused. Whether the ROADM sales in the quarter hit your expectations? My expectations are about 105 million? Were you able to get there? Or was it short of that because of capacity constraints?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, demand was certainly much, much higher than that. We got just about to 100 million, and we could have done a whole lot more than that. I'd say that we were constrained by capacity. And I would say it wasn't just in the high-end products. It was across the board. And that's why we're continuing to add capacity, work on productivity increases and expect that to continue to grow over the next three quarters.OperatorYour next question comes from Troy Jensen of Piper. Your line is open.Troy Jensen -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst Congrats on the nice results. So just another follow-up here on the divestiture. So I guess I'm trying to figure out how much laser chip sales are you guys going to capture here, all right? So if you're divesting 20 to $25 million in revenues, how much of the laser business -- the chip sales would that customer create in these upcoming quarters? Or indirect way, costs are going to be what percentage of the bottom is the laser chip?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So just to be clear, on the 20 to 25 million, the majority of that is the divestiture. There are products that we're just phasing out and not continuing that were legacy Lumentum products. So those won't be adding incremental chip revenue. I'd say that the business that we divested 2 to $3 million of incremental chip revenue in a quarter to support CIG is something that you could expect. But as they grow -- and the 400-gig transceiver was just hitting the market. I think we're expecting that business to be very, very successful for them and, in turn, very, very successful for us from a chip revenue standpoint moving forward.Troy Jensen -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst OK. Perfect. And then one follow-up. I know you said in the call a couple times you guys reached about 20 million in annual synergy sales. I believe at OFC, when this divestiture was announced, Chris said that this is included in the 60 million synergy number that you're trying to achieve. So I guess my question is, are you guys actually at kind of a 40 million synergies based on the guidance you gave us for June? Or is there -- or am I thinking about that wrong?Chris Coldren -- Senior Vice President of Business Development Well, I think you're both. Our prepared remarks commented that through the third quarter that we had achieved more than 20 million of synergies. Obviously, with the CIG transaction closing now here part way through the fourth quarter, we will see additional synergies in this quarter. With that said, obviously, there is a set of costs that transferred the day we closed the transaction to CIG, and there's also a set of costs that are going to take us some time to remove, if you will, some stranded costs. So I think you're going to see the kind of numbers we talked about from a synergy standpoint related to the divestiture and not just the divestiture, but also the product line exits, feathering in Q4, as well as in the Q1 time frame.OperatorYour next question comes from Richard Shannon of Craig Hallum. Your line is open.Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC -- Analyst Hey, guys thanks for taking my questions as well. I had a question on 3D sensing as we look into the second half of the calendar year. Alan or Chris, could you comment on kind of the competitive environment as it leads to your expectations for share? You've talked in the past about having some share minimums. Wondering if those are -- you're expecting those to stay in place. And are they roughly the same levels as you've had before? And as that leads into any comments about ASP changes as you expect in the second half of the year would be helpful also.Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, I mean, we can't talk specifically about negotiations that are either ongoing or closed with our customers. But I'd say that we believe that we still have a very, very large share. We expect that to continue through the second half of this calendar year. And at the same time, prices do come down in consumer electronic devices. But we expect our cost to be able to keep up with the ASP reductions and, therefore, continue to have above average and above 50 points gross margin with respect to our 3D sensing revenue. So I don't see any reason why we're going to lose a bunch of share. I think as we listen to our competitor -- our one competitor makes their announcement about their 3D sensing revenue, it gave us even higher confidence of our very, very high share there.Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Second question from me is on your pluggable business. I'm wondering if you could help us understand the dynamics with the ACO product line that came in from Oclaro? And obviously, adding in your own to-be-qualified DCO this year, whether you expect that pluggables business to be able to grow in this calendar year? And then just as a sidebar, you mentioned the 1.2 terabit module. Is that something expected to be even qualifying your sampling this year?Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Absolutely. I think to answer your first question, pluggable revenue, if you look at ACOs, ACOs are going to be pretty stable as network deployments continue and as existing networks light up more wavelengths, as they're going to continue to buy ACOs. I think as we look at DCOs, we should see a ramp-up in the second half of the calendar year to not cannibalize the ACOs because I think it's actually different slots and different systems as we'll go into, so we should see growth in that pluggable business. And as I said before, I think customers are looking for a viable second source for the DCO module, and I think we're the guy to be doing that. On the 1.2 terabit, that -- we're going to start shipping and start seeing somewhat I'd call meaningful revenue in our first fiscal quarter.OperatorYour next question comes from Tim Savageaux of Northland Capital. Your line is open.Tim Savageaux -- Northland Capital -- Analyst Good morning. Glad to sneak in again. Question is focused on 3D sensing. And Chris, I didn't quite hear your response to the calendar year growth question. But I think you said you expected calendar year growth in 3D sensing '19 over '18. I guess my addition to that question is, would you expect that to be the case with your largest customer? And then to kind of try and flesh out the magnitude of the ramp in the second half. As I look up and down the supply chain in terms of what commentary and plans there have been, it seems to me that the supply chain's gearing up for something on the order of a 30%-plus increase whether you measure capacity or revenue for this sort of second half calendar ramp relative to previous ramps. Last couple years, your 3D revenue has been pretty tightly bunched in that kind of 230, 240 million range for the second half of '17 and '18. I wonder how you feel about that potential growth trajectory. And also, if you can comment on that calendar year growth question.Chris Coldren -- Senior Vice President of Business Development Yes. I will start with the calendar year growth question and say, I think in calendar '18, we continued to under ship, I would say, relative to customer shipments out, if you will. Because in calendar '17 or even in the first half of calendar '18, probably, we're over shipping at that point in time, and therefore, had a negative impact to calendar '18 overall revenues for us. As we turn into calendar '19, we don't have perfect data here, but we believe that the level of inventory of -- or excess inventory of calendar '19 is less than going into calendar. And therefore, even if customer end units don't significantly grow up -- go up, we should be able to grow in the calendar year. I don't want to get into any specifics on situations at customers, but I think given we have a lot of concentration in our lead customer, the comments would apply to them as well.OperatorOur last question comes from Mark Kelleher from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.Mark Kelleher -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Great, thanks for me in here. Just wanted to go back to the ROADM ramp and connect it to your commentary on the transceiver ramp following that. How strongly -- how closely linked is the transceiver ramp to the ROADM ramp? And what's sort of the timing we should anticipate? Will transceivers be pretty hot and heavy in a year or two? What's the timing of that?Chris Coldren -- Senior Vice President of Business Development I would say that installing ROADMs in absence of transceiver -- I mean there's not a lot of purpose in putting a ROADM or a ROADM network if you're not going to be ramping the transmission equipment that goes through those ROADM. There are some scenarios where you're upgrading some infrastructure, but that wouldn't contribute to the level of ROADM sales that we're seeing either necessarily new network deployments that will drive transmission equipment going through those ROADMs. In terms of timing, it can be a few quarters delay. I don't think there is any hard and fast rules. It depends on what network operators and the end customers, if you will, are having their plans of whether they want to install all of their ROADMs first or half of their ROADMs first and then start installing transmission equipment. But I think the level of both ROADM sales, as well as the commentary we have from our customers about their plans would continue to give us confidence that we're going to see an increasing transmission market as we look into the 12 months.OperatorThat was our final question. I'll now turn the call back to Mr. Alan Lowe for closing remarks.Alan Lowe -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Chris. I want to thank our customers for their business and partnership. I also want to thank our employees for their hard work and putting us into an excellent position for long-term growth. We regularly discuss our business in investor relations events. These events are listed on our website in the investor relations section and are regularly updated. This concludes our call for today. We would like to thank everyone for attending, and we look forward to talking with you again in another few months.
