At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.\n[Operator instructions].I would now like to turn the call over to Patricia Cosgel, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.\nPatricia Cosgel -- Vice President Investor Relations\nGood morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Avangrid's first-quarter 2018 earnings results. Presenting on the call today are Jim Torgerson, our chief executive officer, and Rich Nicholas, our chief financial officer. A team of Avangrid officers will also be participating on the call to answer your questions.\nIf you do not have a copy of our press release or presentation for today's call, they are available on our website at www.avangrid.com. During today's call, we will make various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in Avangrid's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website, avangrid.com.\n\nWe do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional informational and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP financial measures.With that said, I'll turn the call over to Jim Torgerson.\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Patricia, and good morning everybody and thank you for participating in our call. Avangrid really had a very good first quarter and we are on track to meet our earnings outlook for 2018.When you look at the net income, as reported, it was $244 million, or $0.79 per share, which was up 2%. Adjusted income was $243 million, or $0.78 a share and that's up 7% over the adjusted numbers for the first quarter of 2017. It's very important that we are continuing to implement our strategic plan and as we said previously, we decided to sell our non-core gas storage business and we completed to the sale of the gas trading business on March 1.\nWe now have a definitive agreement which has been reached to sell the gas storage business, the asset themselves, and that's expected to close in May. Now once we close that sale, the proceeds from the two businesses will be about $225 million, and that's going to be subject to final adjustments.The renewable business has, at this point, 497 megawatts onshore wind and solar that are currently under construction and those will be operational by the end of 2019. We are also executing on new opportunities that are not in our long-term outlook. We're very excited about the New England Clean Energy Connect project that was selected in the Massachusetts RFP and we'll be making a filing with the Mass DPU shortly for that project.\nMoving ahead with our Vineyard Wind partnership, as it's the first offshore bid in Massachusetts RFP to file the construction and operations plan and then commence the environmental assessment process. Now in the first quarter, Vineyard Wind also submitted a bid in the Connecticut RFP for 190 megawatts of offshore wind. The selections for the winners in both Massachusetts and Connecticut are scheduled for May and June respectively at this point.Now on Slide 6, you see the earnings results and for net income, and this is what I will call the SEC GAAP required reporting. That still reflects the gas storage, two months of gas trading, and mark-to-market.\nAnd as you can see in the left half of the slide, the earnings per share is up 2%. Our two businesses, network and renewables, performed well in the quarter. The comparison doesn't reflect their solid performance due to a less favorable mark-to-market and the absence of positive discrete tax adjustments in the first quarter of 2017 in renewables.Now, on the right side of the slide, you see the reconciliation of the first-quarter earnings to the adjusted earnings. And it started at $0.79, the gas storage and trading results.\nThis is the removal of a positive result of $0.04. We had a trading loss from the held-for-sale measurement. Really, this was a lower price that we received and we estimated early on. That affected it by $0.05.\nAnd then renewables' mark-to-market was $0.01. So our adjusted earnings per share were $0.78.Turning to Slide 7 and the adjusted earnings. Now this excludes certain nonrecurring non-core and mark-to-market items. And you can see that our earnings were up 7% and this positions us really well to achieve our annual guidance target.\nWhen you look at the quarter itself versus 2017, that net income was $0.73. Networks, actually, was up $0.09 to 0.65 a share. That was up 17%.Now we look, the results of that, because of the multiyear rate plans in New York and Connecticut which also includes Southern Connecticut gas rate plan that went into effect January 1 of this year. We have been implementing our best practices and cost management and we also had some lower earnings sharing compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nThe higher rate base, the tax reform impacted that, as did our existing our additional capital spending. We really haven't adjusted the earnings sharing mechanism, probably do that in the second quarter for what we see.Renewables was actually down $0.04 to $0.15 a share. However, we had a very positive operating performance at renewables with improved wind resources. We had 590 megawatts of new wind and solar projects and increasing production on the PTCs, really reflects the renewables operating performance.\nThe adjusted gross margin was actually up 11%. Although there were some positive discrete tax adjustments in the first quarter of 2017, which reduced our year-over-year comparison. The net capacity factor was at 33.6% for the quarter, versus 31.5 in the prior year. This was a result of better wind and new capacity.\nAverage prices were down about 2%.Now, the PPA and merchant mix remains about 72% to 28%. And when you look at the PPAs, we really have none expiring in 2018, about 104 megawatts in 2019, none in 2020, just under 300 megawatts in 2021, and then a little over, 542 in 2022. Our secured portfolio remains at 1.45 gigawatt that is secured, highly likely is up 100 megawatts, that's 0.3 gigawatts. So with that, we have 1.75 gigawatts we put in the secured and highly likely category.\nSo have we got 2.1 gigawatts that we need yet, 0.9 gigawatts are secured to get the 2.7 that we want to have by the end of 2022.So turning now to Slide 8, the networks regulatory update, and we want to talk a little bit about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In New York, in March the staff recommended the net benefits to be deferred and passed back to customers through a current rate case or a sur-credit would be effective on October 1 of this year. The company is proposing to offset some of the storm cost and the AMI revenue requirements instead of just passing it directly back. Now in Maine, we are proposing a tax act savings offset recovery of the October 2017 major storms in our on July 1, '18, annual true-up.In Connecticut and Massachusetts, the proceedings are in progress.\nAnd under FERC, the New England Transmission Owners formula rate will automatically capture the benefits of United Illuminating and CMP. FERC has also opened proceedings and is addressing comments at the moment. Some other areas of the regulatory in New York, the AMI discussions are ongoing. We anticipate approval later in 2018.\nThe earnings adjustment mechanism discussions have been impacted by the ongoing storm activity and the AMI discussions and other things, so that's been delayed somewhat.Connecticut and Massachusetts, we are planning rate filings for Connecticut Natural Gas and Berkshire Gas in the second quarter of 2018. For CNG, rates would be effective for January 1 of 2019 and for Berkshire Gas, probably in effect for the second quarter of 2019. With FERC, the administrative law judge has recommended no change in the ROE for Complaint IV. The existing ROE was not shown to be unjust and unreasonable.\nWe feel that's positive but the commission will still ultimately need to decide and there's really no time frame at this point to make that decision. There has been no progress on Complaint I remand or the Complaint II and III.Now on Slide 9, very pleased that the New England Clean Energy Connect was selected and this is in partnership with Hydro-Québec. Now Hydro-Québec has responsibility to the border in Canada and CMP is all through Maine. To refresh your memory, the project is 1,200 megawatt to the DC transmission line above ground.\nIt's going to link Québec and New England so we can deliver hydropower to Massachusetts. It is the lowest cost solution, we believe, and it's also the shortest. It's 145 miles, all of that on the right of way we control and there is an existing transmission corridor for about two-thirds of the project. The other third will be through what I call virgin territory.\nBut we have talked to the landowners. They understand we are going to be building it and we are getting strong support from the communities involved.It's a $950 million investment, excluding AFUDC. The pricing is fixed. The levelized pricing for 20 years and keep in mind, it's levelized, as many projects are in this context.\nThe construction will be between 2019 and 2022 and the ongoing contract negotiations with the electric distribution companies in Massachusetts with the goal of filing with the Mass DPU shortly and approval then would be expected in 2019. The remaining permits and approvals were all filed in 2017 and we expect to receive all the main approvals by the end of 2018 and other approvals by the end of 2019.As you can see the list of the key permits and approvals, we have the Massachusetts PUC approval of the contracts, then we have the Maine PUC certificate of public convenience and necessity, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection approval which really goes along with the Presidential Permit and then ISO-NE impact study, Army Corps of Engineers, and then the FERC approval of tariff. We are highly confident of our ability to deliver this on time and within the budget and keep in mind, it was not included in our long-term projections and we have the financial strength to be able to absorb this and then finance it directly.On Slide 10, I want to give an update on the offshore wind. The offshore wind prospects are getting considerable momentum in the U.S.\nNow, part of our long-term growth strategy, although, again, not in our long-term forecast, established the offshore wind. We established that about a year ago as a new business and we plan to be a leading role in the industry with offshore wind. Now one of the, the first one we do was in March 2017 when we won a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management auction off Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. We have a 100% ownership of that lease and that could produce up to 2.5 gigawatts of energy.\nWe also acquired through an acquisition of a 50% interest in the partnership of Vineyard Wind. Now, it's a partnership with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. We believe this is the most mature offshore wind project in the Massachusetts RFP. Now I will get to that in a minute as to why.Now, there was an RFP for renewable energy resources in Connecticut, and Vineyard Wind did 190 megawatts offshore into that process.\nThe selection should be announced in June of this year. Massachusetts had legislation requiring 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. Now the current RFP in place is for up to 800 megawatts. Now you are required to bid 400 and could bid also 200 or up to 800.\nNow that selection is expected later in May. Vineyard Wind actually bid 400 and 800-megawatt project. We expect to be commercially operational by 2021 and we are the only company to provide direct benefits to Cape Cod. Our O&M center is going to located in Martha's Vineyard and we are the first company to apply for the construction and operation plan and to start the environmental assessment process.Also, there are other activities on offshore wind opportunities that are coming up.\nIn New York, they are looking for 800 megawatts in the fall and 2,400 megawatts by 2030. Rhode Island is evaluating or looking to evaluate the implications from the Massachusetts RFP and wants information on that, how it could impact Rhode Island. So there is an expectation that Rhode Island may be looking for some offshore wind as well.And Massachusetts BOEM opened two new areas for lease that could impact the future there and we will be looking at those very closely. And Governor Phil Murphy in New Jersey is said to be looking for about 3,500 megawatts offshore of New Jersey.On Slide 11, we will focus on the offshore wind again.\nAnd Avangrid is very well-positioned for a leadership role in the U.S. offshore market. We have significant proven U.S. onshore renewables and transmission experience.\nRenewables has the third largest installed capacity in the U.S. of 6.4 gigawatts. We have a pipeline of eight gigawatts of projects we can get into. And we also in Maine, the recent successful completion of over $1 billion transmission project which came in on time and on budget.\nWe have significant proven global offshore experience with our affiliate of Avangrid and Vineyard Wind partner CIP. Both have significant experience with offshore wind. They have a deep technical knowledge and engineering experience, well-developed supply chain, and relationship, and we have experience managing offshore O&M through the Iberdrola. We have strong financing capabilities.\nAvangrid's balance sheet and CIP's experience investing in and financing offshore wind. So we are in a great position to be able to capitalize on this. We have global teams but we also have the local knowledge that's going to be required.Turning now to Slide 12. We are going to execute on opportunities to achieve our strategic goals.\nWe are exiting the gas trading and storage business. That removes the volatility related to commodities and trading. It also eliminates ongoing net losses from the business, which have been significant. So March 1, we completed the sale of the gas trading business to CCI U.S.\nAsset Holdings. That's a subsidiary of Castleton Commodities International.On February 16, we announced a definitive agreement to sell the gas storage business assets, which is Enstor Gas LLC, to Amphora Gas Storage, which is an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners. That transaction is expected to be completed in May.We are continuing to progress on the execution of our renewable growth plan. The highly likely project, as I said, increased to 100 megawatts.\nSo the secured plus the highly likely totaled 1,746 megawatts. That's about 64% of our 2.7-gigawatt target. We entered into a contract for 100 megawatts at Klamath Peaking Plant. Renewables entered into a contract with Portland General Electric and it is a contract for five years beginning in 2019.\nWe are also moving forward with the targeting of transmission in new regions. So the networks business has registered submit transmission bids into the RFPs in MISO.Now Slide 13. I want to highlight a couple of, the long-term outlook is on target, as we said from our February 21 Investor Day. We had solid earnings performance in the first quarter of 2018, the new wind projects in operation, the multiyear rate plan for NYSEG, RGE, UI, and SCG.\nWe continue to employ the best practices and achieve cost mitigation. This is an ongoing process that's going to continue and as we keep moving forward, we are going to keep looking for best practices and reducing our costs and being as efficient as possible.Implementing the tax reform in all the major jurisdictions. As we said, we completed the sale of a non-core business, gas trading March 1, gas storage is going to be in May, and we are well-positioned for long-term growth outside of the plan --New England Clean Energy Connect program, selected in the Mass RFP. We are positioned for growth in the offshore with lease ownership and multiple New England region offshore wind targets.\nSo today we are affirming our 2018 earnings per share outlook of $2.16 to $2.46 and the adjusted earnings per share to $2.22 to $2.50. And the 2018 guidance is based on adjusted earnings per share.Now before I turn it over, I want to acknowledge Rich Nicholas, who's announced he's going to be retiring in July, early July. So this is going to be his last earnings call, I believe. Rich and I have been working together for a dozen years now, and he's been a great assistance provided us [ph].\nWhen you look at the things we've accomplished, starting with UIL, and doing the acquisition of the gas companies, Rich was integral in that. And then just as importantly, an integral part of the merger with Iberdrola USA. So Rich has done a great job of getting, helping get that done, then the integration afterward. So, Rich, wanna thank you for everything you've done and now I'll turn it over to you.\nRich Nicholas -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, thank you, Jim, very much. I really appreciate your kind comments. So again, just to wrap up on the first-quarter earnings. I am on Slide 15 now, where we have our U.S.\nGAAP roll-forward from the first quarter of 2017 to first quarter of 2018, by segment. As Jim mentioned, the strong performance in networks contributing significantly to the increase in earnings over that period. And when you turn to Slide 16, we have the adjusted earnings per share, a 7% increase quarter over quarter, again really driven by networks and renewables strong operating performance, but we had positive tax adjustments last year that did not recur in 2018. And I will cover some of those positive results from an operational perspective in renewables in just a moment.So on Slide 17, we have the segments broken out there.\nAnd networks up 17% on an adjusted basis year over year, quarter over quarter, primarily driven by the rate plan increases, the steps that were already approved in New York NYSEG and RGE and in Connecticut for UI and Southern Connecticut Gas. In addition, we continue to focus on cost-management implementation of best practices. Now last year, in Rate Year 1, we had accrued about $10 million pre-tax in the first quarter for sharing with our New York companies. And Rate Year 2 will be determined in the second quarter of this year.\nGiven the growth in rate base, both from our capital program as well as tax reform, we would expect the sharing amount will probably be somewhat less in 2018.On the FERC-regulated transmission side of networks, we did have a higher rate base on our capital program. And that contributed $0.01 a share in the quarter compared to last year.Moving to the corporate segment. It was essentially flat year over year.For the renewables segment, we really benefited from the increased capacity in service from the projects that went in, including the production tax credits that come along with those and net of increased depreciation on those assets, we picked up $0.06 a share quarter over quarter from that new capacity. Sales from existing wind and solar assets added $0.01 per share.\nThis was offset somewhat by the production tax credit roll-offs of $0.02 and lower renewable energy credits of $0.02 a share. As I mentioned, tax was negative when you compare quarter over quarter, but as you recall, there were positive adjustments primarily related to state unitary taxes that occurred in the first quarter of 2017.On Slide 18, we have some additional operational details around the renewables segment. As you can see in the upper left quadrant, we added 590 megawatts between the two years, and we have 497 megawatts of PPAs that are now under construction. In addition to the new capacity, earnings were positively impacted by a 7% increase in our load factor, which was up to 33.6%, such that our overall production increased 15% as shown in the lower left quadrant.\nOverall pricing declined 2%, primarily due to renewable energy certificate sales as compared to last year.Moving to Slide 19. We bring all these components together in terms of gross margin impacts, which was up 11% quarter over quarter, or $25 million. And that adjusted gross margin for the quarter had the largest contribution coming from the new capacity. As I mentioned, that was about $21 million.\nExisting assets added $5 million, offset by a negative $5 million in pricing. PTCs, even net of the roll-off, we did pick up $6 million and roughly $2 million negative from everything else. Again, a very positive operational quarter for the renewable segment.So turning to Slide 20. Our financial strength remained strong.\nAs Jim mentioned, the ability to finance some of these new projects closed the quarter with 28% net leverage and net debt to total capitalization, 30% funds from operations to net debt and 2.9 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA with BBB+ investment-grade credit ratings across the board.So on Slide 21, we are affirming our 2018 outlook on both a GAAP and an adjusted basis and for the business segments as well as the consolidated amounts. On an adjusted basis, our guidance is $2.22 to $2.50. And again no change in the segments. The outlook does reflect the sale of the gas storage and trading business, normal wind, and the additional 590 megawatts of capacity that went into service in 2017, and we assume networks will earn [Inaudible] return and into the sharing bands.On a personal note, As Jim mentioned, I will be retiring in early July.\nSo this will be my last Avangrid's earnings call. And although I will see many of you at the upcoming AGA financial conference, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the many incredibly talented people both inside the company and in the investment community that I have had the privilege to work with and come to know as the CFO of UIL Holdings and now Avangrid.Thank you for your time, your energy, and always your interesting questions. And in particular, I would like to thank Jim for demonstrating every day that being a leader and being a gentleman are not mutually exclusive. It has truly been my pleasure.I will now hand the call back to our operator for one more round of those interesting questions.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nAvangrid, Inc.

And our first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJosephine Moore -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGood morning everyone. This is Josephine on the line for Julien. Hope everyone is doing well.\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi Josephine.\nJosephine Moore -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi. So my first question is on the New England Clean Energy Connect. We have heard some concerns about grid congestion. Could you provide any color on that? Is there possible mitigants that you have been considering?\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nThe grid congestion, it's really the cluster study that's being done at New England ISO that has to be done and there's one party in front of us that's pushed it back a little bit. We're not concerned about it. New England did a study earlier that said there were 1,200 megawatts of transfer capability into the New England system from Maine. And Bob Kump is here, who heads up our networks business.\nI don't know, Bob you want to?\nRobert D. Kump -- President and Chief Executive Officer of Avangrid Networks\nNo, you are absolutely right. The studies have been done and shown that there really isn't congestion. So we have no concerns in that regard.\nJosephine Moore -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. That's great to hear. And then second, how are you thinking about the financing for the project? Is that going to be all debt on your end?\nRich Nicholas -- Chief Financial Officer\nWe certainly could. This is Rich. We certainly could finance it with all debt, given the strong balance sheet that we have and still be one of the leaders in terms of the strength of our balance sheet going forward.\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nWe have a strong cash flow and between internal cash flow and debt, we will be able to finance that project rather easily.\nJosephine Moore -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOK. Great. And then just moving to the offshore. I think you had highlighted that you have the most mature project.\nNow we know that one of your competitors is looking at the FAST-41 program. I was wondering have you considered that as well?\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Laura Beane here, who heads up our renewables business, is here. So I will let Laura touch on that.\nLaura Beane -- President and Chief Executive Officer of Avangrid Renewables\nYes, you bet. We definitely did consider that. We have been working hand-in-hand with BOEM all throughout the process and the determination that we made, not in isolation, was that our current path was going to be optimal. As you know, we have submitted our COP and it is out for public comment through April 30 and then we will be expecting our environmental impact statement this fall with another 45-day public comment period.\nAt that point, it would be approved or approved with comments or rejected. So we are well on our way and we feel confident in our ability to meet the 2021 online date.\nJosephine Moore -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nAnd when would be the construction beginning for that? Like when would you start construction? Sorry.\nLaura Beane -- President and Chief Executive Officer of Avangrid Renewables\nIt depends on how you define construction. But we would probably begin at least 24 to 18 months prior to the online date.\nJosephine Moore -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOK. Great. That's all on my end. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDurgesh Chopra -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nHi guys. Good morning. It's Durgesh, on for Greg. How are you?\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi Durgesh. Good. How are you?\nDurgesh Chopra -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGreat. Just to follow up on the New England Clean Energy project. So there you will be booking AFUDCs as you do construction from '19 through '22. There shouldn't be any material [Inaudible] lag, right?\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nCorrect.\nDurgesh Chopra -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. And then just one follow-up on the Klamath contract. Is that currently a merchant or it's already in the contract and you are simply extending it?\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nThere was a contract that we had previously. This is a new contract which starts in 2019.\nDurgesh Chopra -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. Perfect. That's all I had. And Rich, big congratulations and it's been a pleasure.\nRich Nicholas -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you very much. I appreciate that.\nDurgesh Chopra -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThanks, guys.\nOperator\nAnd our next question is from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is now open. If your line is on mute, please unmute it. And our next question is from Andrew Levi with Avon Capital.\nYour line is now open.\nAndrew Levi -- Avon Capital Advisors -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nRich Nicholas -- Chief Financial Officer\nHi Andy.\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi Andy.\nAndrew Levi -- Avon Capital Advisors -- Analyst\nCongratulations Rich.\nRich Nicholas -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, sir. I appreciate it.\nAndrew Levi -- Avon Capital Advisors -- Analyst\nYes. You have been very helpful to us. So we really appreciate all the time that you spent with us. So thanks again.\nSo just on the renewables side, could you guys just talk about just kind of what the wind resource was like? I guess our understanding is that we had very strong wind resource in the quarter. And then I have a follow-up to that.\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think the wind resource was pretty much as expected for the quarter for us. Because keep in mind, we are across the entire U.S. So it varies in different areas. But it actually looked pretty good across the board.\nI don't know, Laura, you want to comment a little more?\nLaura Beane -- President and Chief Executive Officer of Avangrid Renewables\nYes. I think it really did come in just about at our average that we have been pointing to for the last couple of years. February was particularly strong in the Western region. And as Jim said, it really depends, varies by region and because we're operating in all regions, it tends to be an average for us.\nAndrew Levi -- Avon Capital Advisors -- Analyst\nOK. And then just to kind of weed that out a little bit because I guess looking at various maps, it seems that the wind resource, particularly in the Midwest, was particularly strong, but maybe it was too strong from talking to people where depending on types of machines you had, you had to dial back the machines because of the strength of the wind. Did you see any of that happening for your machines? And then I have one more follow-up to that.\nLaura Beane -- President and Chief Executive Officer of Avangrid Renewables\nYes. I think we definitely experienced high-wind cutouts in various regions. I would say in the Midwest this first quarter, it was really weather that impacted us more than anything in terms of icing conditions and heavy snows. We had numerous instances where we were unable to man the farms and we were unable to reach turbines for corrective maintenance or putting turbines back online after strong winds for short periods of time.\nSo that probably affected us the most.\nAndrew Levi -- Avon Capital Advisors -- Analyst\nWell, very interesting. Because we're trying to just figure it out for the industry in general. And then can you guys just talk about on a high level, because I guess obviously we have kind of been working on is, I guess, depending on maybe the age of the machines, but obviously the technology that was possibly on the existing machines or enhanced or whether the machines are new, but I guess there's the ability that when the wind is very strong, as you know, that if you have, I don't know, like Siemens makes a gearing technology where instead of having to move the machine to neutral, you kind of gear it down and gear it up. Could you kind of talk about that as far as your fleet is concerned possible? And if not, you guys can follow-up.\nI don't know if you have that detail. But we were just kind of curious, because like in the Midwest, I guess, it seems like it's more weather-related, whether you have that technology on your machines and I don't know if the word is percent or majority, or however you want to talk about it, and maybe just talk about the technology in general, as we find it very interesting.\nLaura Beane -- President and Chief Executive Officer of Avangrid Renewables\nYes. Sure. I think it's probably best for us to follow up if you want specific details. We do have turbines from six different OEMs across our fleet.\nAnd it will all really vary based on the manufacturer as well as the vintage of the turbines. As you are aware, every new version of the turbines come with improved technology and I think the industry has done a really nice job working to increase capacity factors and resiliency of these machines and their ability to continue to generate through high-wind conditions where, as you referenced before previously, they would just be turned into neutral or tread themselves out of the wind. But we could certainly follow up with technology-specific update, if you are interested and what technology we have available and where in our fleet.\nAndrew Levi -- Avon Capital Advisors -- Analyst\nYes. I definitely would. And if IR could call us, that would be really helpful because we're just kind of doing a lot of work on that right now. And I guess also the age of the machine, too, right, makes a difference as far as whether you would, obviously if it's a new machine, it has that technology, but if it's an older machine and the PTCs are running out, you may not wanna, or you're not gonna repower it, I should say.\nMaybe that's not the right word, repower, but you understand as far as recontracting or maybe, I guess, repower's the right word. But the point is, whether you would add that technology? Have you been adding that technology to some of your older machines?\nLaura Beane -- President and Chief Executive Officer of Avangrid Renewables\nWhen you say, add technology, for the most part --\nAndrew Levi -- Avon Capital Advisors -- Analyst\nWell, I guess the ability to gear it, I guess.\nJames P. Torgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\nAndy, there is a couple of things you could do. One, repowering is clearly one. But that's when you actually replace 80% of the moving parts pretty much, or 80% of value in order to get the PTC. That's one aspect.\nThe other is software upgrades, which is what Laura was talking about and we are actually doing that right now with a lot of our machines, which boost the power output from them. So those are things that we look at all the time. And as you said, also the newer tech, the newer machines actually have more technology in them. So you pick up more of it.\nSo there's a lot of things going on. We keep up to speed on all of that.\nAndrew Levi -- Avon Capital Advisors -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you. If we can get a call about it, we'd appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you, and I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Jim Torgerson for any further remarks.\nJames P.
