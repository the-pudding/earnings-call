Mendo?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nThank you, Bruce. Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review the highlights of our financial results. We'll compare our fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended on March 31, 2019, to last year's quarter and fiscal year ended on March 31, 2018.\nFor the fourth fiscal quarter ended on March 3, 2019, our sales were $64.6 million, compared to sales of $67.3 million for the same period the prior year, a decreased from 4.1%. For the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2019, sales were $283.4 million, compared to $273.8 million for the prior fiscal year, an increase of 3.5%. The decrease in sales for the quarter was due to decreases in reorder and new orders sales, and the increase in sales for the fiscal year was due to increases in reorders sales. Increased online competition negatively impacted the sales for the quarter.\nThe average or the value was approximately $85 for the quarter, compared to $89 for the same quarter the prior year. The decrease was due to lower pricing. For the fourth fiscal quarter, net income was $6.6 million or $0.32 diluted per share, compared to $10.2 million or $0.50 diluted per share for the same quarter the prior year, a decrease to net income of 35%. For the fiscal year, net income was $37.7 million or $1.84 diluted per share, compared to $37.3 million or $1.82 diluted per share a year ago, an increase to net income of 1.2%.\nIn addition to decreases in sales, the decrease to net income for the quarter was mainly due to lower gross profit margins and higher advertising expenses.\nReorder sales decreased by 1.9% to $55.9 million for the quarter, compared to reorder sales of $57 million dollars for the same quarter the prior year. For the fiscal year, reorder sales increased by 6.3% to $241.8 million, compared to $227.5 million for the prior-year. New orders sales decreased by 15% to $8.7 million for the quarter, compared to $10.3 million for the same period the prior year. For the fiscal year, new order sales decreased by 10% to $41.6 million, compared to $46.3 million for the prior year.\nWe acquired approximately 101,000 new customers in our fourth fiscal quarter, compared to 113,000 for the same period the prior year and we acquired approximately 467,000 new customers in the fiscal year compared to 521,000 for the prior year. For the quarter, approximately 85% of our sales were generated on our website, which was the same as the prior year. The seasonality in our business is due to the proportion of flea, tick and heartworm medications in our product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak season with fall and winter being the off season.\nFor the fourth fiscal quarter, our gross profit as a percent of sales was 32.1%, compared to 37% for the same period a year-ago. For the fiscal year, our gross profit as a percent of sales was 33.6%, compared to 35.7% for the prior year. The percentage decreases for the quarter and the fiscal year can mainly be attributed to additional discounts given to customers in response to increased online competition. Our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales was flat at 9% for the quarter, compared to the same quarter the prior year. And for the fiscal year, it was at 8.7% compared to 8.9% for the prior year.\nFor the quarter, we spent about $6.5 million in advertising, compared to $4.3 million for the same quarter as the prior year. For the fiscal year, our spending was $22.1 million for advertising, compared to $19.3 million for the prior fiscal year. We restarted television advertising during the quarter to increase brand awareness. Advertising cost of acquiring a customer for the quarter defined as total advertising expenses divided by total new customers acquired was approximately $65 compared to $38 for the same quarter as the prior year. And for the fiscal year, it was $47, compared to $37 for the prior fiscal year. The increases are mainly due to increases in online advertising costs and the readdition of television advertising to increase brand awareness.\nWe had $100.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $21.4 million in inventory with no debt as of March 31, 2019. Net cash from operations for the fiscal year was $45.1 million, compared to $37.4 million for the prior fiscal year. The majority of the increase was due to decreases in inventory compared to the increases in inventory for the prior fiscal year. Capital expenditures were approximately $600,000 for the fiscal year.\nThis ends the financial review. Operators, we are ready to take questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nCertainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kevin Ellich of Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.\nKevin Kim Ellich -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions, Mendo. I guess, let's start off with the increased advertising spend of $6.5 million this quarter. Wondering if that's a good run rate to think about as we update our models for fiscal '20. And then also with the ad campaign, when did you guys start that? Was that for the entire quarter? Or was that started kind of in February?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nThe late February was when the television advertising started.\nKevin Kim Ellich -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nOkay, and thoughts on ad spend for fiscal '20?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nYeah, probably it's going to be a double-digit increase, that's what we anticipate. We're working on optimizing it at this time. So we'll see where it ends up.\nKevin Kim Ellich -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nGot you. And then, in the press release you also talked about making some investments to your e-commerce platform to improve customer service. Just wondering what areas specifically and how much are those investments going to be or what you're planning?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nThe investments is going to be about $5 million approximately. The focus is the usability of the website speed, up-selling, cross-selling capabilities, hyper-personalization capabilities.\nKevin Kim Ellich -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nOkay, that helpful. And then Bruce noticed inventories on the balance sheet declined about $11 million sequentially. Just wondering is that just due to your outlook for the year or timing due to pricing? Any thoughts.\nBruce S. Rosenbloom -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nIt's the later. It's just timing of promotional buys. There wasn't a major incentive to buy during the fourth quarter. So we just ran our inventories at our normal levels.\nKevin Kim Ellich -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nOkay. And then last one for me is, we all know there is lot of competition in the marketplace, where there are lot of pricing pressure. But just wondering with all that cash you have on the balance sheet, what bullets do you have left to fire to fend off competition or drive growth or stabilize margins.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nWe will be price competitive and increase advertising to promote brand awareness.\nKevin Kim Ellich -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nErin Elizabeth Wilson Wright -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks. Another question on the competitive landscape here. I'm just curious where most of it's stemming from? Is it mostly from the Chewy.com of the world and with Petco and Express Scripts, or is it more from the that associated kind of online offerings such as, the Vets First Choice of the world. I'm just curious if it's newer concepts that are making inroads? Or -- and where you think kind of -- I guess better positioned yourselves in terms of those competitive dynamics? Thanks.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nIt's coming from online, direct to consumer models.\nErin Elizabeth Wilson Wright -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. All right. And then thinking about sort of going into next year, we could see some meaningful changes in the pet parasiticide landscape with the potential launch of new flea, tick, and heartworm triple combination products. I guess, how we should we think about the opportunities for you and as well as some of the risk factors too, given your inherent exposure to parasiticide. I guess do you think you'll be able to get great access to these products? Or how can you better position yourselves in light of some of the new development and innovation across the industry. Thanks.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nIt will be positive for us. Any new medication that comes to the market is going to be -- should be a positive for us.\nErin Elizabeth Wilson Wright -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Thank you.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti and Company. Your line is now open.\nAnthony Chester Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti and Company -- Analyst\nYes. Thank you and good morning -- for taking my questions.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nGood morning.\nAnthony Chester Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti and Company -- Analyst\nSo just wondering, as far as the mix of prescription over-the-counter. I know you guys don't give out those numbers, but I was just wondering if there was any notable change in the quarter -- for this quarter versus a year-ago?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nThe majority of the business is prescription and I will leave it at that.\nAnthony Chester Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti and Company -- Analyst\nGot it, OK. So as far as the gross margin, roughly 32%. Is that a good run rate that we should expect going forward?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nWe anticipate continuing pressure on gross margins and it's going to depend on the competitiveness of the markets. We'll see where it ends up.\nAnthony Chester Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti and Company -- Analyst\nGot it, right. And as far as the advertising strategies. So you mentioned double-digit increases that you anticipate in fiscal '20. Are you looking at a similar type of spending online versus TV, versus print? Or are you looking to make any changes to that?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nThere's a significant cost increase online due to the more competitive market. So as we said, we started television advertising during the quarter to increase brand awareness. We're currently working on optimizing it. And our budget is flexible depending on our ROI. So we'll see where it -- how it shapes up.\nAnthony Chester Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti and Company -- Analyst\nGot it, OK. So meaning you can pull back if you're not seeing the returns that you anticipate?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nThat's a possibility.\nAnthony Chester Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti and Company -- Analyst\nRight, right. Okay. And as far as the $5 million cost, is that primarily CapEx? Or will some of that flow through the income statement?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nI believe it's CapEx, primarily CapEx.\nAnthony Chester Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti and Company -- Analyst\nGot it. All right, thank you. Best of luck.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. A follow-up question comes from Kevin Ellich of Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.\nKevin Kim Ellich -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nHey, Mendo. One thing that kind of jumped out to us too was reorder sales down 1.8% this quarter or 1.9% I think you said. We haven't seen that happen in the long time even with the increased competition. What are you seeing in the competitive market, anything different? And I guess even though it's still kind of early May, wondering if you saw any bounce in April?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nLower pricing negatively impacted the reorders sales, also the colder weather might have also had a negative impact. Competitive pressures though has also had an impact. So we'll see what happens.\nKevin Kim Ellich -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nOkay. Do you think that's going to bounce here with flea and tick season?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nWe hope so.\nKevin Kim Ellich -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nOkay. And yes, that's it from me. Thanks.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nThank you. We have another question on queue was coming from Anthony Lebiedzinski of Fidelity. Please proceed.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nOkay, one final question.\nAnthony Chester Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti and Company -- Analyst\nYeah, good morning, guys. Yeah. So as far as -- just the reorder sales comment that I was just wondering. So was it all pricing? So just wondering as far as the number of orders from reorder customers, was that kind of flat or up and then it was all negatively impacted by pricing? Just wanted to get a better clarification on that?\nBruce S. Rosenbloom -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYeah, orders were up about 0.5%. So the rest of the decline in sales is due to lower pricing.\nAnthony Chester Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti and Company -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you for that.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nA question next on queue coming from David Westenberg of Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nHi, thanks for taking the question. So a kind of a question on -- follow-up to Erin's question. Are you actually seeing any, maybe differences in success in getting the authorization from veterinary clinics. I know the -- sort of the alternative models coming in with online pharmacies with vets. Some of the vets are adopting maybe a strategy of trying to refuse authorization. So is that actually happening and maybe has that had any kind of effect? Thank you.\nI don't think that's having an impact. Actually there's a slight improvement this year compared to last year.\nDavid Michael Westenberg -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst\nSo the conversion is actually improving, do you think actually maybe that is -- maybe a build on effect because there are now the Chewy's in the (inaudible) vet store?\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nIt's possible.\nDavid Michael Westenberg -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you very much.\nMenderes Akdag -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) At this time, we have no questions on queue.
