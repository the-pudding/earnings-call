Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Brian Denyeau, ICR, investor relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Denyeau -- ICR, Investor Relations\nThank you, Keith. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's fourth-quarter and fiscal 2019 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of market today.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Brian; and thank you to all of you for joining us today to review our fourth-quarter and full-year results. The fourth quarter was a tremendous finish to what was a milestone year for MongoDB. Our results reflect broad-based performance in all geographies across industries and among small, midsize and enterprise customers through our sales-led and self-serve channels. I will be discussing our results for the fourth quarter and full year on an ASC 605 basis only.\nLater, Michael will review our results under ASC 606. To quickly summarize, our fourth-quarter results. We generated revenue of $83.1 million and 85% year-over-year increase, which was above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 87% year over year.\nAtlas revenue grew more than 400% year over year and now represents 34% of revenue, and we ended the quarter with over 13,400, up approximately 130% compared to a year ago. For the full year, we generated revenue of $253.8 million, a 64% year-over-year increase, which was above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenues 67% year over year, and Atlas revenue grew more than 400% year over year and represented 24% of annual revenue. While we constantly seek to get better at what we do, we are quite pleased with our performance last quarter and last year and are well positioned for fiscal 2020 and beyond.\nWe have established MongoDB as the next-generation database platform of choice, and our goal is to maximize the massive market opportunity in front of us. We believe our wide appeal, the success of our customers and our financial performance continue to clearly highlight that MongoDBS document database offers the best way to work with data. Documents correspond directly to objects in mainstream object-oriented programming languages so developers can store and organize data according to the natural relationships among entities in the real world. This enables developers to focus on building applications the way it makes the most sense, not on working around the limitations of their database.\nOur document-based architecture addresses a broad range of popular data models, enabling a wide variety of use cases. As a result, MongoDB is experiencing accelerating adoption with developers. The total number of MongoDB downloads from our website alone is now more than 60 million, with more than 20 million occuring the last 12 months, up from more than 12 million in fiscal 2018. It should be noted that there are between 20 million to 25 million developers in the world today.\nClearly, developers, customers and the broader market are now starting to understand what we among in MongoDB have known for a long time: that documents, not tables, are the future of this market. Because of our enormous popularity, there are other solutions that now try to emulate MongoDB's capabilities. However, none of these imitation databases are built on a true document architecture. Because there are fundamental architectural differences between MongoDB and these other imitation databases, customers have to deal with severe feature and performance trade-offs, in addition to the deep vendor lock in with these invitation offerings.\nUsing MongoDB dramatically increases developer productivity, enabling organizations to innovate more easily and deliver more value more quickly to their own customers. What was particularly exciting about our results in the fourth-quarter and fiscal 2019 was the breadth of customer adoption and the wide variety of use cases employed. The common theme we see across our customer base is that businesses today are incredibly motivated to find new ways to innovate, either to pursue new market opportunities or to respond to new competitive threats and need a platform that lets them do so quickly and efficiently. Increasingly, the answer for customers in nearly every industry and geography is MongoDB.\nI'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting just a small sample of the customer wins and interesting use cases in the quarter. Last quarter, we added another business unit of IHS Markit's financial services division. The fixed income pricing business selected MongoDB Atlas to support its migration from legacy services and provide a data platform with rich querying capabilities, multi-region distribution and end-to-end encryption. WirelessCar, the world's leading innovator of connected vehicle services, is migrating core components of their IoT platform, which gives automotive companies real-time visibility into vehicle performance.\nMongoDB Atlas will help reduce the time it takes to bring new features to market from weeks to days and dramatically cut onboarding times for new customers. LINE, one of the biggest messaging platforms in Asia, is in process of expanding its offerings to financial services. They chose MongoDB for the scalability of the platform and how easy they can develop and manage their applications. BBVA, a global banking group, has 37 applications running on MongoDB, including a financial aggregator, customer data hub and analytics.\nWith MongoDB, BBVA is able to easily offload applications from their mainframe, develop new capabilities more quickly and leverage valuable data such as data on customer buying behavior in real time. Ulta Beauty, the largest beauty retailer in the U.S., chose MongoDB Atlas to support a new artificial intelligence application. Transics, a WABCO company, develop fleet management systems for truck, driver, trailer, cargo and subcontractor management. They are using MongoDB as a platform for their IoT data hub.\nBreuninger, a German top retailer, migrated from a monolithic legacy system to MongoDB Atlas in order to support their omnichannel integration plans. Catapult Sports, which creates technology to help athletes and teams reach their true potential, is migrating their IoT monitoring platform to MongoDB Atlas. Atlas global clusters are expected to improve overall application performance and increase customer satisfaction in each region. Nationwide, the U.K.\nfinancial institution and the world's largest building society built an open banking mobile app and a data speed layer that has improved data resiliency and increased speed to value for new applications on MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas. Mizuho International relies on MongoDB as an integral part of its core backbone to help scale large amounts of trade data and provide a secure platform for risk reporting. The flexibility, dynamic schema and extensive querying capabilities allow Mizuho to make greater use of their own data. As you can see from these examples, the common theme is that customers are increasingly selecting and expanding their use of MongoDB to innovate more easily and bring new capabilities to market more quickly.\nFurthermore, many of these customer wins cited above demonstrate the tremendous market demand for MongoDB Atlas. We achieved a significant milestone in the quarter as MongoDB Atlas is now at an annualized revenue run rate in excess of $100 million and growing rapidly. The growth demonstrates the wide popularity of MongoDB and the strong product market fit of Atlas. Before we move on to our 2020 priorities, I wanted to provide an update on the licensing change we announced last October with respect to the MongoDB Community server, the free-to-download version of our database.\nIt is very important for investors to understand that since we own all our IP, unlike other open source companies, we have full control over how we license our software. As big believers in open source, we introduced a server-side public license, or SSPL, to address the risks facing companies wanting to make significant investments in open source in the modern cloud era. In the months since we launched SSPL, it has become clear that many others in the open source community share our concern. However, there's not currently a consensus around how to address the issue of open source strip mining.\nIn lack of this consensus, we recently decided to withdraw the SSPL from the OSI license approval process. We have decided to focus our efforts on working with other stakeholders in the open source and broader tech community to either refine the SSPL or develop an alternative license that addresses these issues. To be very clear, current and future versions of MongoDB Community server, including patch releases to prior versions, will continue to be offered under SSPL until there's a broadly acceptable alternative license that is designed for the cloud era. Our performance in fiscal 2019 has given us even more confidence about our ability to capitalize on the large market opportunity in front of us.\nAs a result, in fiscal 2020, we plan to focus on extending our product leadership as a modern, general purpose database, expanding our different go-to-market channels including adding sales capacity in our field and inside sales channels, along with growing our self-serve business; and increasing the number of partners and deepening our relationships with our existing partners to further increase our reach and improve our sales efficiency. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we deepened our partnership with IBM by expanding our technology and go-to-market agreement on the heels of a number of customer wins, including a large hospitality brand, a notable bank, a large government agency and a recognizable healthcare company. Clients are responding to the combination of IBM's product suite and MongoDB as a modern multi-cloud data architecture. We are fortunate to have a highly scalable business model, so even as we invest more in the business, we expect to continue to generate operating margin expansion in 2020.\nTo build a world-class software business, a company needs a large market, strong product market fit and a highly effective distribution channel. While the first two elements are evident for MongoDB, we are also very proud to have built a formidable go-to-market organization that has yielded strong results. To lead our sales organization for the next stage of growth, we were pleased to recently announce the promotion of Cedric Pech to the role of chief revenue officer. Cedric previously led our EMEA sales team, which has delivered compelling results over the past two years.\nPrior to joining MongoDB, he was a CRO at Fuze, a cloud communications and collaboration company. Earlier in his career, Cedric worked with me at both BladeLogic and BMC. He is one of the best sales executives I know, and I believe he will do a terrific job scaling our sales team to drive sustained growth. To summarize, the fourth quarter was a great finish to a terrific year.\nWe enter fiscal 2020 in our strongest position yet. We are at the early stages of a once-in-a-generation shift in the database market. We are confident that if we continue to execute at a high level, MongoDB will be one of the clear winners. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Dev. As mentioned, we're very pleased with our fourth-quarter performance, which reflects strong, continued growth at significant scale. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth-quarter and full-year results and then finish with our outlook for the first-quarter and full-year fiscal 2020. Before I jump into the numbers, I'd like to take a minute to explain the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 that we'll have on our financial results.\nWe've implemented ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis, which means we have recast our prior results for fiscal 2019 and prior periods under the new revenue recognition standard. There are two primary ways ASC 606 impacts our financial results. First, revenue recognition. Enterprise Advanced transactions will now have a portion of the contract value recognized upfront while the remainder will be recognized ratably over the contract term.\nAs a reminder, most contracts are annual. However, for an illustrative three-year contract under 606, we will now recognize the term license component for all three years upfront. This will result in greater variability and reduced comparability in our quarterly revenue results. It's important to note that the adoption of 606 will not impact how Atlas revenue is recognized.\nSecond, sales commission capitalization. 606 broadens the scope of capitalized commissions. Now, under 606, all incremental costs, including commissions and payroll taxes, as a result of closing a deal are capitalized. Previously, only direct deal-specific commissions were capitalized under 605.\nAdditionally, the estimated amortization period is generally longer under 606 as compared to 605. This has the impact of modestly lowering our reported sales and marketing expense. For fiscal 2019, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in a $13.2 million increase in revenue, or approximately 5%; a $6.6-million reduction in sales and marketing expense and a $19.9-million increase in both non-GAAP operating and net income loss. There are additional dynamics that investors should keep in mind under 606.\nFirst, when we sign multi-year Enterprise Advanced deals, we will need to recognize the term license portion of the future-year license revenue upon initial delivery, regardless of whether they have prepaid the entirety of that contract. Second, as a result, our year-over-year growth in any given period may be more variable when the year-ago compare had a greater amount of upfront revenue due to the timing of multi-year deal signings. To be clear, this would not be indicative of slowing business momentum but a function of revenue recognition accounting dynamics. One example of this will occur in Q3 of fiscal '20, which faces a very difficult compare under 606 as we signed several very large, multi-year deals in Q3 of fiscal '19.\nThird, revenue will more closely follow the pattern of historic bookings trends. Q3 has historically been our largest quarter for new bookings and, consequently, subsequent renewals, with Q1 historically the lowest. As a result of this, sometimes Q1 revenue under 606 will decrease in the prior Q4. This happened in Q1 of fiscal '18.\nI'll turn to our fourth-quarter results, which I'll first review on an ASC 606 basis. Total revenue in the quarter was $85.5 million, up 71% year over year. Subscription revenue was $80.6 million, up 73% year over year. And professional services revenue was $4.9 million, up 37% year over year.\nThis was the first quarter of results that included the acquisition of mLab. We were pleased that mLab performed modestly better than our expectations for the quarter. This is on top of very strong organic results, which drove the large majority of the outperformance relative to guidance and reflected accelerated organic revenue growth rates. Our revenue performance was strong across the board and also benefits from stronger-than-expected Atlas consumption, including a number of customers who consumed well in excess of their contractual run rates.\nThe strong growth in the quarter was driven by a healthy mix of new logos and upsell activity by Enterprise Advanced customers, as well as the rapid adoption of Atlas. Atlas represented 32% of revenue during the quarter, up from 10% in the fourth quarter last year and up from 21% last quarter. During the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by over 5,000 customers, bringing our total customer count to over 13,400 customers, which is up from over 5,700 in the year-ago period and over 8,300 at the end of last quarter. This reflects the broad appeal of MongoDB and a diversified customer base across industries and geographies.\nOf our total customer count, over 1,750 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,700 at the end of the prior quarter and over 1,450 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 11,400 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 6,200 at the end of the third quarter. This includes approximately 4,200 customers acquired from mLab. The growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers, as well as new Atlas customers.\nIt is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects both new customers to MongoDB, as well as existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We continue to see healthy expansion from existing customers. Our net AR expansion rate in the fourth quarter remained above 120% for the 16th consecutive quarter. We ended the quarter with 557 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 490 in the third quarter and 354 in the year-ago period.\nWe also saw a significant increase in customer spending more than $1 million annually, which increased from 22 last year to 39 this year. Driving expanded adoption and spend among existing customers is a key component of our growth strategy and has been a consistent area of success. Moving down the P&L, I will be discussing our ASC 606 results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $61 million, representing a gross margin of 71%, compared to 76% in the year-ago period.\nAs expected, gross margin in the quarter was negatively impacted by mLab, which has a lower gross margin than Atlas. This impact will dissipate by the end of fiscal 2020 as we migrate mLab customers to Atlas. Overall, we're very pleased with the continued gross margin improvement of organic Atlas during the fourth quarter. However, we continue to expect that we will see some modest reduction in overall gross margin as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue.\nOur operating loss was $9.7 million or negative 11% operating margin for the fourth quarter, compared to a negative 29% margin in the year-ago period. The more than 1,800 basis points improvement in operating margin reflects the significant operating leverage we drove in the business this year while investing in our continued growth. Net loss in the fourth quarter was $9.1 million or $0.17 per share based on 53.8 million weighted average shares outstanding. I will now quickly review our results on a 605 basis.\nPlease note that we will no longer be reporting our financial results under 605 beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Total revenue in the quarter was $83.1 million, up 85% year over year. Subscription revenue was $78.3 million, up 87% year over year. And professional services revenue was $4.9 million, up 54% year over year.\nAgain, we were pleased with the modest beat in mLab, but the organic results powered the quarter, resulting in an acceleration of our organic growth to the highest year-over-year rate in our publicly reported results. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $58.6 million, representing a gross margin of 71%, compared to 73% in the year-ago period. Operating loss was $14.6 million or negative 18% operating margin for the fourth quarter, compared to a negative 46% margin in the year-ago period. Net loss in the fourth quarter was $14 million or $0.26 per share based on 53.8 million weighted average shares outstanding.\nTurning to the GAAP balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $466.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was negative $9.5 million. After taking into account approximately $3.1 million in capital expenditures, free cash flow was negative $12.6 million in the quarter.\nShort-term deferred revenue on a 606 basis was $122.3 million, up 45% year over year, while total deferred revenue of $137.7 million was up 36% year over year. Please note that the adoption of 606 had a material impact to our deferred revenue balance. This is a result of some Enterprise Advanced revenue that was previously deferred under 605 that is now recognized upfront at the time of the subscription start date. We have provided recast balance sheets by quarter for fiscal 2019, which reflects changes to deferred revenue, as well as modest changes to other assets and deferred commissions.\nWe have also provided deferred revenue balances for the past eight quarters on a 606 basis. Also, keep in mind that Atlas is a usage-based model and generates less deferred revenue than Enterprise Advanced. As a reminder, Atlas is often billed monthly in arrears versus the annual and advanced billing terms we see with our Enterprise Advanced customers. Lastly, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of deferred revenue can also have some level of variability due to timing.\nI'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first-quarter and full-year fiscal 2020, which, as a reminder, is being provided on a 606 basis. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $82 million to $84 million dollars. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $14 million to negative $13 million; and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $0.25 to negative $0.23 based on 54.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal-year 2020, we expect revenue to be in the range of $363 million to $371 million.\nThis includes an updated revenue forecast from customers acquired from mLab of $20 million for fiscal '20, up from the $18 million we had indicated at the time of acquisition. As mentioned earlier, year-over-year growth comparisons and quarter-to-quarter results will likely be more variable under 606 due in part to the timing of multi-year contract signings in prior periods. As you'll notice when you update your models for 606 results, we are facing notably larger compares in the second half of fiscal '20, particularly in the third quarter. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $59 million to negative $55 million; non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $1.06 and negative $0.98 per share based on 55.2 million weighted average shares outstanding.\nAs Dev mentioned, we are investing additional resources into our product development and go-to-market efforts in 2020. Given the size of our market opportunity, the strength of our product market fit and the attractiveness of our unit economics, we believe these investments will generate strong returns for the company. We expect to again generate operating leverage in fiscal '20 even as we make these investments, which underscores the inherent scalability of our business model. In closing, MongoDB finished fiscal 2019 with its strongest quarterly performance in years.\nWe are executing at a high level and generating best-in-class growth. The database market is in the early stages of a transformational shift, and MongoDB is well positioned to be one of the primary beneficiaries of this [Inaudible]. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator? \nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nUnknown speaker\nHey guys, this is [Inaudible] for Raimo Lenschow. Congrats on an incredible quarter here. My first question, can you talk about the product evolution for Atlas in terms of enterprise features, what you've achieved so far and where do you see Atlas evolving to in fiscal '20?\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So thank you for the question. So obviously, we are really pleased with the growth of Atlas. I think what it really speaks to is the popularity of MongoDB and the strong product market of Atlas because customers really want to focus on differentiated work, being able to focus on innovating and build existing applications and not have to deal with the burden of operational and database management.\nIn terms of the enterprise features, we've added a number of security features. And I think we've signaled since the IPO that we were in the process of moving a bunch of features in Enterprise Advanced to Atlas, and we've done that, including a lot of security features. Things like auditing, access control, authorization, etc., including things like monitoring and autoscaling and so forth. So all those features now are embedded in Atlas, and there's a variety of different service offerings, depending on the SLAs and the features that customers want.\nUnknown speaker\nOK. And as my follow up, a little bit more of a boring question. But on 606, what percentage of the total contract are you recognizing upfront for the enterprise contracts? And does your guidance assume a similar percentage of multi-year contracts for FY '20 versus FY '19?\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, sure. So there'll certainly be some variability. We have not seen any major changes in terms of the mix, although certainly to the extent that that mix varies, that will impact the results. It varies.\nIn terms of the question of how much of the upfront license, obviously it affects on the duration of the contract, as well as on the product mix. But generally roughly in the area of a quarter is the current estimate, although obviously as things continue to move and change, we will update that accordingly.\nUnknown speaker\nAwesome, thank you.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd as you can see from a macro perspective, if you look at the full year, it has in fact about 5% on overall revenue.\nUnknown speaker\nOK.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. This is actually Keith Weiss sitting in for Sanjit. Two questions, one kind of looking backwards on Q4.\nThat was a pretty amazing quarter, really strong acceleration. Anything in particular kind of turn on for you guys? Any kind of catalyst to that acceleration in your performance that you could point out to on what happened in Q4? And then the second part of the question and kind of looking forward to FY '20, with Pech now sort of taking that chief revenue officer and heading into the new fiscal year, any significant changes you guys are making in sales structure or go-to-market strategy with sort of the new sales leadership into the new fiscal year?\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, thanks, Keith. Glad to have the big dog on the call. I just wanted to respond to the two questions. So I would say our performance was really a function of the flywheel effect.\nI think we've seen a number of advancements on the product. And so that's given customers a lot of confidence, especially around asset transactions and the fact that we are now -- it's clearly understood that we are truly a general purpose database, and the wide variety of use cases that customers employ us for is clear evidence of that. I think the fact that we have notable marquee references across a wide variety of industries gives customers even more confidence. And I would say the efficacy of our go-to-market channel has just gotten better and better over time.\nClearly, there's a little bit of seasonality in our business, and so the fourth quarter tends to be a big quarter in general. But we were quite pleased with the performance that we saw and I still believe that there's lots of things that we can get better at over time. And in terms of Cedric's appointment, I was quite thoughtful about looking at a successor for our last CRO. And I did talk to a number of people outside the organization.\nBut as I looked at how quickly our business was changing and the complexity of our business, it made much more sense to promote someone from within. Cedric is also someone I've known for a long time. He did a fantastic job in really driving the European business. And since his appointment, he's really won over the rest of the sales force.\nI would say that there's going to be no major changes to the sales force. We have a really strong bench in North America, in Asia and the rest of the world. I think what Ced is really going to focus on is just taking our sales process and our ability to scale the sales organization to the next level to drive sustained growth. So you're not going to really see any wild changes in terms of how we go to market.\nKeith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nMore just about scaling the current organization?\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nExactly.\nKeith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it, excellent. Great quarter, guys.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Keith.\nMichael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Keith.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you so much. I was just wondering if you could share with us, there's been a lot of debate in the market about mLab and customers potentially leaving. And I just was wondering if you could set the record straight and just kind of walk us through whether or not you do expect some customer migrations. There's been different versions of what's going on in the market.\nI was just wondering, since we're on this call, if maybe you could just kind of level the playing field for everybody and just kind of tell us what you're expecting from that acquisition. And if you did have one or two customers leave, what would be the driving force of that? And kind of any other feedback you've heard from their installed base. Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, thanks, Heather. The reason we acquired mLab was really, they were the pioneers in the MongoDB as a service offering, and they did that way ahead of us. And the other thing that they did a really good job of was to build their entire business on a self-serve basis. They didn't have one salesperson.\nSo those two things were really a big reasons why we acquired that business. And the talent that we've acquired from Will Shulman on down has been very impressive and really pleased to have that team as part of MongoDB. When we did our diligence, there was clearly some understanding that there were some customers who may be moving in different directions. Candidly, some of those customers were working on really old releases of MongoDB.\nThey had not upgraded to more recent versions of MongoDB. And so we've factored in some of that attrition into our guidance and estimates. And so we don't see any material impact to any of the potential changes that you may have heard. And we are now starting to build relationships with many of these customers.\nObviously some that are very small customers, some of them are larger customers. And it's going to take some time for us to get them to understand the benefits of upgrading to the latest releases of MongoDB. And we shall see about how those relationships evolve. But we have taken a very conservative posture, and there's no impact on our guidance.\nMichael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Heather, the only thing I would add, just so that people understand, is we just shared the customer count for mLab, which is approximately 40 to 100 customers. And when you look at the revenue that that's driving, the math for that works out to be around $5,000 a year. So these are typically not large customers. Yes, there are a couple of outlier customers that are larger and have brand names, but the vast, vast majority of the customer base is of a much smaller level.\nAnd clearly, we've been pleased; there was a modest beat in Q4. We upped the fiscal '20 guidance just on this call from the $18 million to the $20 million. So I think it's going sort of well and better than expected. And so that's all, I think, very healthy.\nHeather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK, great. And then just one quick follow up would be, is there any way you can share with us your lands, kind of the pace of your lands and how those initial lands might be increasing, especially with some of the new enhancements to the product over the last year?\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I would say our lands are definitely increasing. I think it's for a number of factors. One, I would say, is we've clearly made some pretty significant product enhancements over the last few years. It has given customers more confidence to use us for mission-critical workloads.\nI would say, two, I think I mentioned this in prior calls, we've become clearly viewed as a very strategic partner to many customers. So the level at which we engage with in these organizations tends to be at quite a higher level. And so that allows us to go after bigger deals. And then I would just say in general, the efficacy of our go-to-market process where we try and do a lot of discovery early on in the engagement with the customer, but then use that information to go high in the organization to present the potential benefits we could offer and a clear understanding of the pain that they're going through, whether it's trying to consider building a new application or they're struggling with the performance or the brittleness of an existing legacy application.\nAll of those things are impacting our ability to get bigger lands. So that is definitely happening. But this is still a land and expand business because this is not a winner-take-all market. We still have a very small percentage of wallet share of some of the largest customers that we have, and we still have to go and earn more business from them.\nBut we feel very, very confident of our ability to do so, given our track record to date.\nHeather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nGreat, thanks very much. Dev, with respect to the DocumentDB announcement, have you seen that have any impact in your ability to build top-of-funnel pipeline?\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe've seen no impact, Brad. In fact I think it's frankly raised MongoDB's awareness. I have to remind people that 98% of the market today is built on relational databases, a technology that's over 40 years old. So when you have people now trying to emulate MongoDB, what it really signals is one, that we've become incredibly popular.\nAnd the reason we've become incredibly popular is that the document approach is now being viewed as the best way to work with data. And so now, if customers are starting to say, well, instead of using relational databases, I want to use document databases and they want to do a bake off, we feel very confident about our ability to go head to head with any other alternative out there. And so we think that actually this has been great for our awareness, great for customer education, and we see no impact on a negative basis whatsoever.\nBrad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nGreat, and just one quick follow up, and I know we sort of asked in aggregate, but the Atlas business accelerated 100 basis points sequentially to 400% growth from 300% last quarter. Is that a function of some year-end true-ups with customer contracts or just a function of that level of acceleration in the installed base? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So Atlas benefited from a number of dynamics, and we're very, very pleased with the quarter. Obviously we have the addition of mLab for the first time in the quarter. But even if you strip that out, it was a very strong and accelerating quarter from an overall Atlas performance.\nIt's strong edition of new customers. It's consumption with existing customers. The other thing that we did try and call out in the prepared remarks though was that we did benefit from a number of customers in Q4 who were consuming Atlas at rates in excess of their contracted amounts. And so we always keep an eye to that in terms of like what is the relative run rate and how does that compare relative to the contracted rate.\nAnd so we don't have enough history with Atlas yet to know as to how much of that is sort of pulling forward or actually establishing a new run rate level. And so we want to keep an eye on that and want to make sure that sort of expectations don't go out of control as you all extrapolate things, because I do think that that's a dynamic that's at play. But it was really very, very strong across the board.\nBrad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks very much, guys.\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] We'll take our next question from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nBrent Bracelin -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you, and I have one for Dev and a follow up for Michael. Dev, wanted to drill down on Atlas. It's kind of hard not to discuss just given the momentum of the business here. Few businesses we see at a $100-million run rate growing this fast.\nAnd even if I back out mLab, it looks like growth accelerated again. You talked a little bit about kind of consumption, but I was wondering if you could just drill down a little bit more relative to why this business is accelerating now and at this pace. Is there something that happened in the quarter, are you seeing higher attach rates of the addons, security services? Any sort of additional color on Atlas. And I know you talked a little bit about the customer spend over $1 million going into 39.\nAre there any Atlas customers now spending $1 million-plus on that category? So any color on what drove the momentum in Atlas would be helpful.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I would say the fundamentals, thanks for the question, I would say the fundamentals are the following. One, obviously, MongoDB has become incredibly popular. And two, the product market fit of Atlas has been incredibly strong. I mean, we've seen high growth rates since we launched the the product about two and a half years ago.\nSo it's just exceeded our expectations. I would say what's also now kicked in is two things. One, our sales renovation, it took some time for our sales organization to know how to sell a cloud service. And what we've seen in the results is that the sales organization's acumen around doing that has become better and better.\nAnd the other thing is the introduction of the enterprise features. The enterprise features have allowed two things to happen. One, allows us to get bigger deals and also has given comfort to a certain type of customer who is very, very concerned about, say, things like security and data security in the cloud. In fact, we had a very large notable financial services institution who basically contracted quite a large deal with Atlas, and they tend to be pretty conservative.\nThey're moving very slowly into the cloud, and this was a consumer-facing application. So that's very, very sensitive consumer data. And they spent an enormous amount doing a lot of assessment of our technical architecture, and they got convinced about the strength of the product and the best-in-class security features and that resulted in a large transaction. So that's just one anecdote, but there's lots of anecdotes like that, where large sophisticated customers who now want to move workloads to the cloud are moving toward Atlas.\nAnd the other big benefit for customers is that there's no lock in to any particular cloud provider. So while they may choose one cloud provider today, they recognize that those relationships may evolve over time, and they like the flexibility of being able to move from one cloud to another cloud. And so that gives -- and frankly moving that application back in house without have to rewrite one line of code. So that gives customers enormous amount of comfort and optionality in terms of what they can do in the future.\nSo all those factors are driving, I think, the acceleration of MongoDB Atlas.\nBrent Bracelin -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery helpful color there, encouraging to hear some larger opportunities pop into Atlas as well too. I guess for Michael as a follow up, gross margins kind of look like it did downtick. I know this is the first quarter with mLabs. Is that the big contributor there? And how should we think about kind of the gross margin here in the low 70s? Is this kind of the sustainable rate, or do we still have a little bit of a mix shift we need to think about relative to that gross margin profile going into fiscal 2020?\nMichael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So thanks, Brent. Yes, there will definitely continue to still be mix shift. The higher percentage that's driven by Atlas is acting as a short-term drag on the overall gross margin.\nmLab though, to your point, is meaningfully lower gross margin than Atlas, and so that's a particular kind of incremental drag that, by the end of the year, should dissipate. But I would not say that this is -- this is not the bottom we'll continue to see as Atlas, assuming it continues to grow faster, we will see some short-term gross margin compression. But we continue to see increases in organic Atlas, Atlas x mLab gross margins. And we've been very pleased with the performance there, and we'll continue to work toward driving those higher over the next several quarters.\nBrent Bracelin -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks, that's all I had.\nMichael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Richard Davis with Canaccord.\nRichard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity Inc. -- Analyst\nThanks very much. So I think you guys recently partnered with Datadog. I think it was on Atlas. But could you talk briefly about that relationship? But just more broadly, could you provide some light color as to kind of what are obvious places where future technology partnerships make sense? Because obviously you need to build every single item out there.\nSo thanks very much.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So thanks, Richard. Just in full disclosure, I am actually on the board of Datadog, and I've been there for quite some time. But frankly, this announcement we just made was really a function of organic interest by our customers.\nObviously, Datadog has done incredibly well as a private company, and their monitoring tool has become very popular. And so being able to get visibility into MongoDB database statistics, because the database is probably the most important layer of any application, is critically important for customers. And so providing that integration made a lot of sense for customers. And so in terms of other partnerships of potential integrations, it's integration to other complementary management tools that may help customers.\nFor example, we integrate with Kubernetes. That has become the container of choice for lots of customers to orchestrate and virtualize their application environments. We've built that integration so customers have a Kubernetes operator to basically invoke MongoDB and all the functionality with MongoDB. So there's a bunch of other types of integrations that we've done.\nAnd so we basically work backwards from what are customers looking for, how can we help customers better manage their infrastructure, or how can we do it better on their behalf and make it easy for them to build new applications? And that drives our integration priorities.\nRichard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity Inc. -- Analyst\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron -- Oppenheimer Holdings -- Analyst\nThanks. It's Ittai. Congrats, great quarter, guys. Couple of questions for me.\nFirst on the services revenue and another one on [Inaudible] such a great quarter but growing only a miserable 37%. Help me understand the disconnect between that and subscription. Is it just because that Atlas is a little bit more self-service than the rest of the business? How do I think about the correlation of that going forward to subscription revenue?\nMichael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Ittai. I think the most simple explanation is the subscription revenue is recurring revenue, whereas the services revenue is typically one-time. And so you're really sort of starting all over again. And so when you think about the amount of services that you're delivering in the aggregate, it's actually 0:47:15.7 a pretty healthy growth rate.\nGiven the fact that you're usually starting over. That's probably the biggest factor. Qualitatively, we do also see a little bit lower services attach rate on Atlas. But the principal driver really is around how much of this is recurring revenue versus one-time revenue.\nIttai Kidron -- Oppenheimer Holdings -- Analyst\nVery good. And as a follow up, Dev, just want to make sure I understand your IP comments about if SPL, your withdrawal from the OSI approval process. Can you explain? Are there any implications for this outside of just a headline that I guess you cannot call yourself right now open source officially? What's the implication of this?\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI would say the implication is the following: we own all our IP. This is important. So like any other software who owns all IP, we can control how we license our software. We are also big believers in open source, and so it's clear that the concerns we've raised, and we tried to codify those concerns in our new license called SSPL, there's been a lot of receptivity to that but it's clear that the industry needs more time to coalesce around what the right answer is long term.\nSo rather than trying to force people to use SSPL as the answer, we say let's rather be a good partner to the rest of the community. We want to work with the community and come up with an answer that makes sense for everyone. And so long story short, our software is still licensed under SSPL, not only current and future versions but also any patch releases to prior versions that we license under SSPL. So that's an important point.\nAnd we believe we're still open source. Whatever name you may want to apply to it, source available, free to use, we still conform to the four software freedoms that the open source principles point out. The freedom to run for any purpose; the freedom to study, change and have access to the source code, the freedom to redistribute copies and the freedom to distribute copies of modified versions. And all those freedoms still apply.\nSo from that point of view, we are still an open source company.\nIttai Kidron -- Oppenheimer Holdings -- Analyst\nVery good. All right, congrats. Good luck.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Ittai.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson.\nUnknown speaker\nHi guys. This is Hannah on for Rishi. Thanks for taking my question. First question, I was just wondering on functionality, if you've gotten any feedback from customers or if on your end there's any sort of functionality that you still like to build out on the core Enterprise Advanced product.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOh yes. So we have -- I mean, obviously we have a very strong and robust roadmap. We're investing a lot in R&D. And so for example, we are introducing asset transactions for, asset for chartered clusters.\nSo that adds another level of asset capability. We have field-level encryption coming out. We have something called retryable writes that adds more resiliency to your application so you'd have to worry about if a write fails. You don't have to worry about building in logic to deal with that.\nThat's going to be built to the database. So there's a whole bunch of features that are coming out in our two release later this summer, and we're very excited about that release. Obviously, we continue to innovate on the Atlas front. We also have products like stitch that enable developers to more quickly build applications.\nSo you're seeing us continue to expand the aperture of what we do to help customers use MongoDB for more and more use cases. And I won't comment on this now, but I think you'll hear some really interesting announcements of something that we're going to be expanding into that we are really, really excited by. And I'll save that for another time.\nUnknown speaker\nOK. That's really helpful, thanks. And then second question, I was just wondering if you could expand a little on your deep end partnership with IBM and if their go-to-market strategy changed at all and how the partnership differs from what it was in previous quarters.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. So one of the reasons we struck an agreement with IBM is while we're growing really quickly and we're building out our sales force relative to the market opportunity in front of us, we still have a fairly small sales organization. So one of the things that we are trying to solve for is reach, because we see this once-in-a-generation shift happening in the database market. And the things that we worry about are deals that are happening that we're not even privy to.\nAnd so the things that IBM does for us is really expand our reach, especially in markets that we don't have presence in or accounts that we don't have presence in. And the other way they help us is that because of their deep history and knowledge of key IBM accounts, they can also accelerate deals and make deals bigger more quickly than say we could do on our own. So both those factors has really allowed us to have really a win-win relationship. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we've closed a number of deals.\nMomentum is very strong. So we further deepened our relationship, and we feel very excited about what that relationship can deliver for us in fiscal 2020 and beyond.\nUnknown speaker\nThank you.\nOperator\nWe'll take Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst\nHey, thanks. Good evening. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact of the licensing changes. Have you seen that? Obviously, the companies that were using your software and reselling it, like ScaleGrid, Compose, ObjectRocket, have you seen a positive impact from those customers actually moving over to Mongo? Or any other companies you're aware of where customers have transitioned because of the licensing change?\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo I would say that we've had some fruitful conversations and expanded some relationships with certain cloud providers who did not have a commercial relationship with us. And we're engaged with some of the others and hope to do so in the next few quarters. I would say that, in general, the receptivity of SSPL has been very positive. And I would also say that if you're a customer of MongoDB, SSPL doesn't really matter because you end up having a commercial relationship with us.\nSo this is really for the people who are using our free-to-use download version of our software. And so as you can see from our results, we feel really good about the business today and how it's positioned for the future.\nTyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst\nGreat, and then a follow up. Just as you look at next year ahead, how big do you think Atlas could ultimately be as a percent of revenue? And sorry if I missed it, but are you making any changes just from a sales incentive plan around Atlas? I know you were comping the same on dollars previously, but given that Atlas is typically two x the ASP of an Enterprise Advanced, just curious if you're making any changes there.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAgain, I want to remind people that one of our philosophies is to help customers run their workloads anywhere. So you literally could run MongoDB on your laptop if you are developing an application. You could run it on premise and use Enterprise Advanced, and you can run it in the cloud using Atlas. And so we are very committed to enabling customers to run those workloads wherever they want.\nAnd obviously, you can choose your cloud provider depending on where you want to run your workload in the cloud. And so that will not change. And we have not given incremental incentives for our salespeople to sell Atlas over Enterprise Advanced. I think what we're seeing is that, obviously, the mega trend is people are moving more and more workloads to the cloud.\nAnd clearly, our customers are following that trend and they like the fact that MongoDB Atlas is the most widely available global cloud database in the world. It's available in over 60 regions as a virtue of being able to run on AWS, Azure and GCP. And so the fact that customers not only have choice of cloud providers but can really choose to run their workloads almost anywhere in the world, along with the power and the benefits of MongoDB's document model and the query language. And so given all those benefits, there's a reason why Atlas has become so popular.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Dev Ittycheria for any additional or closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI want to thank everyone for joining us on our fourth-quarter call. We really appreciate all the support, and we thank you. And we look forward to speaking to you again.
