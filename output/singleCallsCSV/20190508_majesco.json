At this time, I will turn the call over to Adam. Adam, please go ahead.\nAdam Elster -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks Andrew and good morning to everyone on today's call. I am thrilled about the financial results we achieved in fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and the full year. It completely reinforces my excitement about our future. Our cloud based operating model is the most critical component of our value proposition and it is resonating.\nOur results reflect a growing acceptance of our solutions, as fourth quarter revenue increased 11.9% over the same period a year ago at 13.7% for the full fiscal year over last year.\nCloud revenues increased by 55% compared to the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and 53% for the full year of last year. Cloud revenue now represents more than 40% of our total revenue and 25% of our customer base.\nMajesco's profitability has strengthened as well, which is being driven by a higher margin mix of our revenue. I'm very encouraged by the growing acceptance of Majesco's products which are resonating with our current and potential customers.\nWe had record breaking new sales this quarter and a year which saw our 12 month order backlog increase to almost $100 million. The North American business was extremely strong, with winds across all customer tiers and throughout our product portfolio. We were especially encouraged because the 100% of the new deals in Q4 were cloud solution, and the same was true for our Q4 business across EMEA.\nWe are extremely focused on customer success and for us, each successful implementation continues to amplify our credibility in the market with both our customers and with potential customers. As closely as we track new sales, we also track customer go lives. Our ability to reduce project timelines is a critical benefit to customers and our overall cloud business model.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we had six customers go live, including two who had purchased the technology in the third quarter. This validates our ability to drive speed to market and time to value. Now customers continue to partner with us and we are extremely focused on where they are today and where they want to be in the future.\nTheir strategy is concentrated on optimizing technology investments and establishing a new platform for an overall digital experience. We knew as a Company that we had to make our image in the market match our voice and our execution about the future of insurance.\nLast month, we launched our new brand messaging, web site, and corporate video. If you have not had a chance to see it, please check it out. Our interactions with customers, partners, investors and analysts, all show incredible alignment to our strategy and this vision.\nIn April, we had our Annual Customer Conference, Convergence and we crushed previous attendance records growing nearly 50%. The rise in attendance underscores Majesco's market leadership and the rapid growth in adoption of our cloud, API and micro services based platforms for P&C and L&A.\nIn fact, many of the presenters at Convergence are not actually delivered by Majesco, but by -- rather by a wide range of partners, customers and industry influencers.\nThis further demonstrates how innovative companies are leveraging our solutions to redefine the future of insurance.\nOur people are the most important asset, and we are focused on empowering our associates and expanding our leadership team and I am pleased with the progress we made within our fourth quarter. During the quarter, Manish Shah was promoted to President and Chief Product Officer. His presentation at Convergence was one of the many highlights that was focused on the rapidly changing market and technology shifts that have become mandatory to compete today.\nWe announced version 11 of our CloudInsurer, P&C and L&A products. He then introduced our LifePlus solutions, rebranded from the Q3 Exaxe acquisition. Finally, Manish demonstrated many of the innovative insurance initiatives that are leveraging our digital first platform.\nIt enables companies to rapidly adapt to their technology needs and leverage the vast and (inaudible) ecosystems. Jim Miller joined the Company in March as our Chief Revenue Officer. He'll be responsible for driving Majesco's overall go to market methodology and execution for the Company's growth strategy. Jim has over 20 years experience earning a reputation for delivering top performance across partnered and direct sales channels.\nJim had worked directly for me for over 12 years and he delivers results. Wayne Locke joined Majesco as CFO last month bringing with him 20 years of finance and operations experience. Before Majesco, he was senior director at Capgemini providing financial and operational consulting services to insurance organizations.\nHe's joining us on this call this morning and will be available during the Q&A. Wayne will assume responsibility for the earnings calls moving forward. This afternoon, we were hosting an investor analyst day at Nasdaq's brand new headquarters in Times Square.\nWe will showcase Majesco's growth strategy and articulate the market opportunity for our brand. We'll highlight Majesco's vision for the future of insurance, emphasizing our next generation capabilities, unparalleled domain expertise, industry leadership and strategic partnerships; all focused on helping insurers meet the demands of tomorrow right now.\nWe will also host a customer and partner panel and there will be demo stations showcasing our three (ph) products. I am very excited by our momentum and I look forward to continuing my active engagements with investors and shareholders and updating you on the Company's future.\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Farid to discuss the success of our financial drivers for the quarter.

Thanks for the opportunity and congrats on a good set of numbers. Sir, my first question is on the Exaxe acquisition. So, excluding that, what would be the organic revenue growth for this quarter?\nAdam Elster -- Chief Executive Officer\nThe Exaxe contribution inorganically to our numbers for the year were less than 2% of the revenue growth of the full year numbers.
