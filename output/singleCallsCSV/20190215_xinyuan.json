Please go ahead.\nLizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director\nThank you, Bill. Good morning. And thank you all for joining our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We are pleased that Xinyuan has maintained strong growth despite the downward pressure on sales across the industry. For the 2018 full year results, the total amount of contracts signed in the year 2018 was $3.2 billion, which is 42.4% higher than in 2017. Correspondingly our full year total revenue increased by double digits.\nDue to the successful selection and execution of our projects, gross profit margin for the year increased to 27.5% resulting in bottom line growth of more than 20% (ph), well above our forecast of 20% to 20% (ph). In the fourth quarter of 2018, our revenue increased substantial reaching 49.1% growth over the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe also made notable improvements to our margins. Gross profits increased 72% year-over-year and the gross margin reached 28.7%. Demand for our active projects in China remains steady and positive, and we advanced on multiple projects while driving positive results for our shareholders.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we commenced pre-sales of 10 new projects, five in Zhengzhou, two in Suzhou, and others in Qingdao, Jinan, and Dalian (ph). Domestic projects made significant contributions to our total GFA sales and total contract sales.\nIn term of offshore development. In the first quarter of 2018, our projects in the US and the Malaysia continued to proceed as planned and our UK project made even further progress in both construction and sales. During the past year, we maintained our commitment to controlling our financial leverage. We successfully reduced our short-term debt ratio (ph) by repurchasing the outstanding bonds and optimizing the debt structure. With increased profit and controlling leverage, we expect to further enhance our financial health.\nIn addition, we are also pleased to continue our dividend payments in this quarter and our ability to deliver value to our shareholders. Going forward, we remain optimistic about our ability to achieve positive operating performance by focusing on our core business, maintaining our competitive advantages, and strengthening our market-leading position.\nNow please allow me to turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Mr. Li Xuefeng. Xuefeng, please go ahead.\nXuefeng Li -- Interim Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Mr. Zhang. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Xinyuan's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Allow me to take you through the financial results for this quarter, further discuss our latest operations and the initiatives, and conclude by updating you on our financial outlook for the remainder of the year.\nTo comply with the SEC's and the Financial Accounting Standards Board's requirements, we have adopted ASC 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1st, 2018. We adopted ASC 606 on an over-time basis via the cost input method and applied the standard only to contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. That means part of our profits will be recognized later than previously estimated under the percentage of completion method.\nOur first quarter results reflect the adoption of ASC 606, especially with regards to revenues and net income and may not be directly comparable to the same period last year. All references below are in US dollar terms, unless otherwise specified (ph). Contract sales was $724 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $823.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $571.3 million in the third quarter of 2018.\nTotal GFA sales in China were about 355,600 square meters in the fourth quarter compared to 443,600 square meters in the same quarter last year and 277,500 square meter in the last quarter. Total revenue increased 49.1% to $1,081.8 million from $725.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and increased 81.7% from $595.5 million in the third quarter of 2018. Increase was mainly due to centralized delivery of projects and pre-sale of 10 projects in fourth quarter.\nThe average selling price per square meter sold in China was around RMB13,500 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to about RMB13,400 in last quarter and about RMB12,100 in the fourth quarter of 2017. SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 9.9% from 10.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased from 8% in the third quarter of 2018.\nInterest expense this quarter was about $20.6 million compared to about $21.8 million last quarter and $25.2 million in same quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease was caused by a lower debt balance at the end of fourth quarter of 2018. Due to foreign exchange fluctuations, the exchange loss in this quarter was about $55,000 (ph) compared to about $13.5 million (ph) of exchange loss last quarter.Net income for the fourth quarter increased to $104.2 million compared to $35.4 million net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDiluted net earnings per ADS attributable to shareholders were $1.15 compared to $0.50 net earnings per ADS in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company repurchased the $2.2 billion ADS in fourth quarter of 2018. The total ADS repurchased in 2018 is $4.5 million.\nOur full year contract sales over 2018 decreased because it only includes contracts that qualify for revenue recognition. Excluded contracts will be qualified in the coming quarters and the contract sales will be recovered.\nBalance sheet; as of December 31st, 2018, the Company's cash and the cash equivalents was $1.2 billion compared to $1.4 billion as of September 30th, 2018.

Thanks for hosting the call and taking my question.

Thank you.\nUnidentified Speaker --\n(Foreign Language) Well, as for the business of blockchain for Xinyuan, we used to release that in our previous quarterly report. And the application for blockchain technology in Xinyuan is now in the very early phase of exploration, especially for the application with our traditional real estate (ph) industry, especially for example like the EVS (ph) project now is in the very early phase. In future days we will have more comprehensive trying and exploration in this area.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) And there are no questions at this time, so I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nXuefeng Li -- Interim Chief Financial Officer\nOkay.
