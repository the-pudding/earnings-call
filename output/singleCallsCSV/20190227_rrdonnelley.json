Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. 2018 was a strategically significant year for RRD as we continued our journey as a marketing and business communications company. Throughout the year, we successfully navigated a challenging and rapidly evolving business environment to deliver our second consecutive year of organic growth improvement in our best organic sales performance since 2014. Further, we completed a number of important strategic initiatives, including reorganizing the company under new segments, launching new technology-driven products and services, investing to strengthen our platform, optimizing our business portfolio and improving our financial flexibility.\nI'm also pleased to share that we concluded the year by being awarded a $115 million contract to produce the 2020 Census. The Census is one of the most complex communication programs in the world, requiring the production of more than 600 million documents mailed to 130 million households across the United States. We will leverage our leading data, logistic, print and operational platforms to complete the questionnaires, letters, inserts, postcards and envelopes required for this program. Our teams are moving full speed ahead with the implementation process and they are laser-focused on completing this critical program with the same impeccable production quality that we provide every day to our clients around the world.\nOn our call today, I will first recap our fourth quarter performance and then review several of our strategic accomplishments for the year. Before turning the call over to Terry, I will also share a few examples that demonstrate how we are leveraging our differentiated capabilities within our Marketing Solutions and Business Services segments to continue to win new clients and expand existing client relationships.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. We delivered a solid quarter performance to conclude the year. On the top line, our results were in line with our expectations with our overall reported sales decline, primarily attributable to the disposition of our Print Logistics business and the planned exit of low margin sourcing business.\nMarketing Solutions returned to organic growth with digital print and fulfillment and direct marketing, both reporting favorable performance. Business Services organic sales performance was negatively impacted by the planned sourcing reductions with BPO, packaging, logistics and forms all delivering organic growth in the quarter. Overall, adjusted for the sale of Print Logistics, 6 of our 11 total products and service categories reported favorable organic sales versus the prior year.\nOur adjusted income from operations was roughly flat to a strong fourth quarter last year, which -- we included our Print Logistics business and we delivered our highest quarterly adjusted operating margin as a post spend company. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that we generated a 21% increase in our operating cash flow versus the prior year.\nTurning to Slide 4. We achieved a number of important milestones during the year to drive our strategy forward. First, to best meet the evolving needs of our clients, we reorganized our businesses into two client-centric segments; Marketing Solutions, a preeminent provider of multi-channel marketing activation programs; and Business Services, a premier global provider of business communications. This shift to a client-centric structure was an important step in our strategic transformation to directly align our businesses with our clients' evolving needs and strategies.\nOur segment structure is resonating with our clients and our segment teams are actively engaged in helping those clients to more effectively manage the complexity of personalized marketing and more efficiently execute their business communications.\nSecond, we took a meaningful step forward in 2018 to reshape our core through the sale of our Print Logistics business. This transaction, which completed in the third quarter, represented a significant first step in our portfolio optimization efforts. Throughout the year, we continue to strengthen our core by successfully executing our business improvement initiatives and lowering our cost to serve. Specifically related to SG&A, we delivered a $30 million cost reduction versus the prior year, have now lowered our SG&A expense to sales ratio by nearly a full percentage point over the last two years.\nThird, we continue to focus on our future by developing new product offerings that expand our leading portfolio of capabilities. During the year, we leveraged our patented digital content delivery platform to launch two new offerings. We introduced our SuperDoc web statement enhancement capability, which allows our clients to turn otherwise fixed business communications into interactive statements and we launched an additional form of digital content delivery with our artificial intelligence-driven voice assistant delivery solution. This technology offering helps our clients to interact with our business communications across voice-enabled devices like Alexa and Google Home. We also introduced Acuity by RRD, a predictive testing program that provides marketers with a quicker and more cost-effective way to validate direct mail campaigns before they launch.\nThe final component of our strategic framework relates to repositioning our balance sheet in support of our strategic objectives. In addition to the previously mentioned sale of our Print Logistics business, we are monetizing certain assets, including two international locations, the sale of our UK facility, which closed in the first quarter, and the sale and relocation of our China facility, which accounts for approximately $250 million of gross proceeds remains on track for a 2020 close. Further, we significantly improved our future debt maturity profile by successfully closing a $550 million term loan B facility that matures in January of 2024.\nSlide 5. The communications landscape is rapidly changing. In our current and prospective clients are vying for customer retention and loyalty in an increasingly competitive environment. To effectively connect with their customers, companies and brands are under increasing pressure to move seamlessly between online, offline and on-site channels and to make each of those interactions highly relevant and personalized. We see this every day as we engage with our clients around the world.\nAs a leading marketing and business communications company, we're providing our clients with the tools that they need to better connect with their customers across the entire business relationship. From the marketing programs, they used to acquire new and inspire repeat customers to the business communications they used to service, inform and transact with those customers over time. We are leveraging our integrated portfolio of products and services to provide innovative solutions that simplify complexity, reduce cost and improve the effectiveness of our clients' marketing and business communications.\nIn our Business Services segment, we've recognized that each communication, be at a customer statement, a product label, a package, a healthcare enrollment kit or any other type of business communication, is an important representation of our clients' brand and represents an opportunity to connect that client to their customer in a meaningful way. We are focused on delivering personalized business communications at scale across both print and digital channels to help our clients better service, inform and transact with their customers over time.\nWe were recently awarded new business with a regional bank holding company that's undergoing a digital transformation and seeking new ways to connect with their customers. Under this new agreement, we will redesign this client's customer facing communications, including bank statements, notices, letters, checks, and tax statements. To enable multichannel presentment across web, email, and interactive statements.\nWe're also implementing the portal that this client can use to prove, audit and track their communications from creation to delivery, including end consumer interactions. Through our integrated suite of online and offline content delivery capabilities, we are helping this client improve customer engagement by delivering each message according to their customers preferred format and delivery channel.\nWe've also expanded our relationship with a large automobile manufacturer to include support of their social responsibility program, which was previously managed by this client's agency of record. We will partner with this client to manage the execution of their events across all of their local markets. Our integrated solution, which will include the procurement of all events support materials, printing of all associated collateral and inventory management will yield significant cost savings for this client.\nIn our Marketing Solutions segment, we're focused on integrating data-driven insights, content and creative services and digital print capabilities in order to help our clients to optimize and activate their marketing campaigns. We've recently expanded our relationship with a large bank holding company. This client was seeking to create an environment in which -- in their branch banks that would drive more personalized conversations with their customers. Our solution is helping them to deliver that environment through a new messaging campaign for each of those branch locations.\nWe previously provided commercial print services to this client and through this expanded relationship, our retail solutions team will manage, produce and install the on-site fixtures, signage and displays that support this client's new call to action for its customers.\nWe've also taken our new creative services in in-store production support for large multinational consumer electronics company. Prior to this agreement, we supported two mobile device launches for this client, which include the creation of print and web collateral for online and in-store production support, video editing and composition, and store training materials. We were awarded the opportunity to support a third mobile launch for this client, because of our proven ability to work within the client's internal workflows, extend their existing brand guidelines and execute seamlessly on their behalf.\nBefore turning the call over to Terry, I'd also like to mention several awards we've recently received that reaffirm our technology and innovation capabilities. First, we won the Application of the Year Award from Xplor International. This award was given in recognition of our proprietary hosted customer communications management on-demand service, which provides real-time messaging composition and multi-channel delivery through a simple portal.\nSecond, each year The Home Depot provides The Entrepreneurial Spirit Award to one of its vendors as a way of recognizing that vendor's ability to adapt to the pace of change in the retail industry and deliver high volume in complex programs. I'm proud to share that RRD received The Entrepreneurial Spirit Award at this year's Home Depot Foundation Event and that we were specifically recognized for our strength in driving innovation in core merchandising, in creating unique experiences for Home Depot's in-store customers. While we take great pride in each of the awards that we've received, this one is particularly rewarding because it represents the entrepreneurial spirit and drive that our employees deliver every day to each of our clients around the world.\nI'm proud of the progress that we've made over the past year and I remain confident in our path forward as we continue to execute our strategic objectives. And, with that, I'll turn the call over to Terry to provide more details on our financial performance and outlook. Terry, over to you.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Dan. So again -- begin speaking to the slides, I would like to share my high-level perspective on our fourth quarter performance. Overall, we performed well against an exceptionally strong quarter last year. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was up significantly versus the prior year and despite higher-than-expected inflationary cost increases, we delivered our best adjusted operating and EBITDA margins since we have operated as a stand-alone company post spin.\nOur overall sales decline, mainly due to the sales from our former Print Logistics business and our planned exit of certain low margin sourcing production to outside providers that was not meeting our minimum profit requirements. But, overall, net sales were in line with our expectations.\nFinally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was below our previous guidance, because of higher inflation and a significantly higher effective tax rate, which I will more fully address later in my remarks.\nPage 7 in the supplemental slides provides a snapshot of our fourth quarter products and services net sales performance by segment and by geography for consolidated RRD. On a reported basis, net sales were down 8.4% in the quarter, which included a reduction of 6.2 percentage points associated with the Print Logistics sale at the beginning of third quarter. After adjusting for this disposition, we experienced growth in 6 of our 11 products and services categories; BPO, packaging, logistics, digital print and fulfillment, direct marketing and forms.\nPage 8 shows the organic sales trend by quarter and by year. We are happy to report that we delivered organic growth of 1.1% for all of 2018, which is our strongest annual top line organic performance since 2014. Our fourth quarter organic sales were down 1.2%, due to the planned reductions in sourcing work. We continue to see the benefit of new client wins and expanded work with existing clients, while lapping the significant new packaging work we produced in the fourth quarter last year.\nOn Page 9, adjusted income from operations of $107 million was $1.2 million lower versus the fourth quarter of 2017. The 2017 results included our Print Logistics business, which was sold in July of 2018. Our corresponding operating margins increased from 5.6% in 2017 to 6.1% this year. The combination of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, improved efficiencies in our Asia packaging operations and an approximate $8 million benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates, positively impacted our results in 2018 versus the same period in 2017. However, the quarter's results were negatively impacted by unfavorable product mix, modest price pressure in business services and higher-than-expected paper and labor costs.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.64 in the quarter as compared to $0.81 reported in the prior year period. The 2018 reduction was primarily driven by a higher effective tax rate. The adjusted effective tax rate was 35% in fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to 19.7% in the 2017 period. As expected, the 2018 rate improved significantly from the first three quarters, but continued to be negatively impacted versus 2017 by tax reform, including the unfavorable impact of recently issued guidance from the IRS. We expect our ongoing efforts to reduce interest expense, among other initiatives, will help reduce our effective tax rate in future years.\nOur GAAP results for the quarter included pre-tax, restructuring and other charges of $16 million, including pre-tax impairment and other charges of $9.7 million, primarily related to our operations in Brazil. During the quarter, we wrote down the value of our long-lived assets in Brazil as we have commenced aggressive actions to address profitability shortfalls. In addition, 2018 results for the quarter also included a net unfavorable tax charge of $18.4 million, primarily related to an adjustment to the provisional taxes previously recorded associated with tax reform.\nNext, I will discuss the highlights for each of our segments. On Page 10, fourth quarter 2018 net sales in our Business Services segment of $1.43 billion were down $166.2 million or 10.4% compared to the prior year. After adjusting for the effect of the Print Logistics disposition, which accounted for a decline of $119.5 million and foreign exchange rate changes, organic sales decreased 1.7% in the quarter due primarily to the previously mentioned planned reductions in sourcing sales as well as volume shortfalls in Latin America, both of which are reflected in our commercial print product category.\nWe've reported growth in our BPO, packaging, logistics and forms product categories for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations of $104.5 million was up $4.9 million versus the 2017 period, which included the results of our Print Logistics business disposed off earlier in 2018. Profitability improved as a result of favorable productivity and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and inflationary cost increases as well as modest price pressure.\nTurning to Page 11. Net sales in our Marketing Solutions segment of $332.6 million for the quarter were up $3.8 million or 1.2% to the prior year quarter on both a reported and inorganic basis. Increases in our digital print and fulfillment and direct marketing products were partially offset by a decline in digital and creative solutions. Our results included the continued impact of a strategic shift away from traditional pre-media services for non-core market segments, which, as expected, impacted our digital and creative solutions sales performance for the quarter. This strategic shift will continue to negatively affect sales comparisons for the first two quarters of 2019.\nAdjusted income from operations of $22.1 million was down $3.6 million from the prior year as productivity gains were more than offset by an unfavorable mix and inflationary cost increases.\nFourth quarter 2018 non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $19.6 million, increased $2.5 million from 2017.\nOn Page 12, net cash provided by operating activities was $267.4 million, which was an improvement of $46.3 million as compared to the 2017 period. As expected, the unfavorable working capital build reported in the first quarter of 2018 fully reversed plus our ongoing working capital initiatives and lower tax payments provided further benefits in the quarter. Capital expenditures of $31.7 million were $0.4 million higher compared to the 2017 period.\nTurning now to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2018, we had total cash on hand of $370.6 million, which was up from $273.4 million last year end. The significant increase in cash on hand in 2018 is due to growth in China's cash position, including the $45 million in non-refundable deposits collected from a prospective buyer of our printing facility.\nTotal debt outstanding of $2.09 billion was down from $2.11 billion last year. Remaining availability on the credit facility was $524 million as of December 31st. Also, at year-end, our pension and other post retirement plans were underfunded by $122 million, which is down significantly from the $179 million unfunded level at the end of 2017. Planned contributions in 2019 under all pension and other post retirement plans are expected to be approximately $8 million, which is $10 million less than actual contributions of $18 million in 2018. The expected reduction is due primarily to lower contribution requirements in our OPEB plans.\nIncome in 2019 from all plans is expected to be approximately $16 million as compared to $22.5 million recorded in 2018.\nBefore I shift to our expectations for 2019, I would like to provide you with an update of our ongoing capital priorities. As I have stated in past quarters, we expect to make strategic investments in our business, including both organic investments and potential acquisitions and we continuously evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to optimize stockholder value, like the recent sale of our Print Logistics business and the sale of facilities and other assets.\nIn regards to the pending sale of an international facility, which I can now report is a printing facility in Shenzhen, China, we continue to make planned progress to construct a new facility that we will utilize to relocate our existing business in mid-2019. We also expect that we will meet the required milestones that will enable us to collect one additional non-refundable deposit in 2019 and we plan to use this deposit to help fund remaining construction costs in 2019.\nWe also believe the project remains on track to receive final governmental approvals late in 2020, at which time the transaction will close and we expect to record a significant gain on the sale. We also continue to focus on improving our balance sheet flexibility. As demonstrations of this commitment, we previously announced that we closed on a $550 million senior secured term loan B credit facility early in the quarter. Further, on February 1st, our 2019 senior notes with an outstanding balance of $172 million matured and we've repaid those notes using proceeds from our credit facilities. As a reminder, these notes bore interest at 13.25%, which was the most expensive issuance in our capital structure.\nPage 13 of the supplemental slide show that various maturities of our outstanding debt by year as of December 31st in addition to the pro forma maturities after giving effect to the repayment of our 2019 notes on February 1st. We have now significantly reduced our 2019, 2020 and 2021 maturities since September 30th of 2018 and have improved our balance sheet flexibility.\nOur expectations for our full year 2019 are reflected on Page 14 of the supplemental slides. For the full year, we expect net sales to range from $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion. Versus 2018 the net sales comparison will be negatively impacted by approximately $200 million of sales in 2018 related to the Print Logistics business sold last July. Aside from the impact of the disposition, the midpoint of our range assumes flat organic performance, including approximately $25 million of sales from the recently awarded 2020 Census project. As a point of clarification, the full sales value of the Census contract is approximately $115 million, but the split between the portion to be recognized in 2019 versus 2020 can be impacted by a variety of factors. We expect that increases or decreases from our midpoint estimate will fall within the range of our stated guidance.\nAdjusted income from operations is expected to range from $225 million to $265 million, which includes both the impact of higher paper and labor costs and our continued strong focus on cost reduction initiatives. The midpoint of our range assumes a neutral impact from foreign exchange rate changes.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.60 to $0.90, reflecting a continued higher effective tax rate. In addition, our interest expense is estimated to decrease in 2019 as a result of the repayment of our 2019 senior notes.\nShifting to our 2019 cash flow, we expect that our operating cash flow will be between $150 million and $180 million. We had higher tax refund last year, which we expect will not repeat in 2019. In addition, we will be relocating our printing facility in China midyear and expect to incur additional severance and relocation costs as well as increased operating costs when we outsource work to third-party printers while the move is being conducted. The total estimated impact to our 2019 operating cash flow related to this relocation is a use of cash of approximately $25 million, which will not repeat in 2020.\nCapital expenditures are expected to range from $135 million to $145 million. Our capital spend is expected to be temporarily higher in 2019, due to two large projects. First, we expect to complete the construction of the previously mentioned China printing facility early in the second quarter. This adds approximately $20 million to $25 million of capital spend to our plan in 2019. Second, as previously announced, we plan to make additional investments in binding, printing and other equipment early in the year related to the 2020 Census contract.\nLooking beyond 2019, we expect our capital expenditures to return to our previously stated range of 1.5% to 1.7% of revenue, which translates to a $30 million to $40 million reduction in CapEx versus the 2019 amount. We also expect to collect a non-refundable deposit of approximately $25 million in 2019 related to the sale of our China facility. As you may recall, the agreement to sell this facility provided for a specific non-refundable deposits to us from the buyer, which are intended to help offset required payments for severance and moving costs and incremental capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2018, we have collected non-refundable deposits of approximately $45 million from the buyer.\nAs I conclude my comments on our cash flow expectations for 2019, I would like to emphasize one key point. Our 2019 guidance includes $45 million to $50 million of cash spend related to the relocation of our printing facility in China, none of which will repeat in 2020. That range includes both the impact to our operating cash flow and the higher CapEx associated with the new facility construction. We expect to fund this with cash on hand in China, which has been given to us from the buyer and specifically we do not expect to increase our debt outstanding for the project or use cash from the United States.\nBefore I wrap up my comments, I would like to comment on our expected performance for the first quarter of the year. We will continue our focus on on-boarding new large clients and reducing our cost structure through productivity initiatives and the execution of our business improvement plans. In addition, we will be intensely focused on the two significant initiatives I have highlighted; the relocation of our printing business in China and the 2020 Census work, both of which are expected to drive higher capital expenditure levels in the first quarter.\nWe do expect our net sales in the first quarter to be down from 2018, primarily due to the sale of our Print Logistics business, which reported net sales of $107 million in the first quarter of 2018 and continued planned reductions in low margin sourcing sales. We have also planned for reductions related to the closure of certain low performing printing facilities in both the US and China.\nSales from the US Census work and a new client we are currently onboarding are expected to help generate organic growth in the last half of the year.\nFrom a cost perspective, we expect to incur start-up costs as we prepare for the US Census production. Additionally, our China margins will be negatively impacted during the relocation to our new facility as we plan to outsource production to third-party printers to minimize client disruptions during this transition period. Higher paper and labor costs will also continue to negatively impact Q1, but we do expect to make further progress passing these increases onto our clients. We expect to partially offset these inflationary pressures through continued cost reductions, favorable FX and lower bad debt expense due to the client bankruptcy reported in 2018.\nInterest expense is expected to be favorable in the quarter, following the repayment of our 2019 notes and our tax expense is expected to be higher. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we expect our adjusted diluted loss per share to be similar to last year's reported amount. Also, each of these factors has been considered in our full year guidance.\nAnd, now, operator, let's open up the line for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Jamie Clement with Buckingham. Please go ahead.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, gentlemen.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Jamie.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning, Jamie.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nHi. Guys, again, I'm not totally clear sort of what the history of your sourcing business was? And kind of why it does an other than just low margin to maybe that debt, why it doesn't fit in kind of what the marketing services and business communications strategy, can you just give a little bit of a history lesson there?\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Jamie. And just to clarify, our sourcing business itself absolutely continues to play a key role as we manage the entire supply chain on behalf of our clients. So as an overall business, it is -- it still remains a core part of our strategy. But we're referencing on our call here as we think about our business improvement initiatives, that goes beyond our cost reduction actions to looking at how are we improving margins collectively across the company within each of our businesses from the top all the way down to the bottom of the -- of the top line down to the bottom of the company.\nAnd as part of that, we have some legacy contracts, sourcing business contracts, that from a margin standpoint just do not meet that threshold and a little bit of the history there is as we take on -- and I want to emphasize that these particular contracts, the vast majority of the work, and in some cases all of the work, is sourcing work. So none of this being produced on our platform, it's being produced outside of our company.\nOur history has been to engage in those contracts and work to do two things; work to bring that work onto our platform where it makes sense to do so and then work to expand our relationships with those clients over time as we help them simplify the complexity and increase the efficiency of their communications. At some point, as those opportunities are pursued and we don't see any development there and we see ongoing volume reductions against the backdrop of a rising cost to serve those particular clients.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nGot it.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt doesn't make sense for us to continue with those relationships. So as we go through those contract negotiations, we move forward with the intent to improve the profitability. If we don't think those opportunities there, we are making the difficult choices to walk away from those pieces of business.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay. And I may have missed the number and if I did, I apologize, but how much of the year-over-year commercial print decline was related in that business?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nJamie, I'll take that. We've not broken that piece of business out separately in our reported product sales, but I will tell you that it was the difference between reporting organic growth for the company in fourth quarter versus inorganic decline.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nOrganic growth for the company, not just -- not the reporting segment -- not the commercial print segment?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIt would have had a -- it would have a similar impact to that segment as well.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo the answer to your question, yes, Jamie. For the entire company, it would add organic growth. That's correct.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay. Got it. Okay. So Terry moving to your guidance, particularly around the Chinese relocation and that sort of thing. Obviously, you're going to have -- so you're going to have severance, you are presumably going to have -- you're going to have training costs, all of those kinds of things, what's not totally clear to me is, is all of that going to get non-GAAP to out-of-adjusted income from operations or is some of that going to be in there, I'm kind of unclear about how that's going to be treated?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Thank you, Jamie, for the question. I referenced that it would have all of those activities related to the relocation would have about a $25 million impact on our operating cash flow. Most of that, roughly $20 million or so million of that $25 million, will actually be in restructuring and about $5 million related to some of the business disruption lower margins from outsourcing, while we are relocating. That part will hit the non-GAAP stuff. So most all of that is going to be called out as restructuring in that part of our non-GAAP numbers.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay. And in terms of -- so we talked about the outflows related to that. So the inflows -- so you've already collected $45 million, there you have another $25 million, we should expect the balance in 2020. Is that the right way to think about it?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So we've already collected $45 million through the end of '18. We're expecting another $25 million in 2019 and then the balance will come late in 2020 when we close late 2020/early 2021.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you all very much. I'll get back in queue.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAll right. Thanks, Jamie.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Jamie.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Charlie Strauzer representing CJS. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nHi, good morning.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHi, Charlie.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Charlie.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nHey. Just to pick up on Jamie's last question there, the remaining cash was coming in from China in 2020. What do you think the remaining net amount will be? Obviously, you've got the $45 million on hand, another $25 million coming in this year, so it's $70 million of the remaining cash, what do you think the net PU (ph) would likely be of that?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Thank you for asking that, Charlie. If you recall on past calls, I've referenced that by the time all the costs and all the taxes are paid and the gain is recorded and everything, we expected to bring back -- have enough leftover cash to bring back about $125 million to $150 million, bringing that back for debt repayment likely in 2021. That estimate is still the same though that multiyear view of all the cash outflows and the eventual cash inflows, all of that has factored everything we're talking about today and everything that we put into our guidance. Just 2019 now is the year when a lot of the stuff is starting to come through, the core financials, meaning the operating cash flow section and the CapEx. But all of that has always been contemplated. Every time I've spoken about, net amounts to come back for debt paydown, all of that's been contemplated and net amount has not changed, our current estimate is still about $125 million to $150 million, of course all that is subject to exchange rate with the Chinese RMB.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. And that's basically net of the construction costs and all the other things and the taxes and all stuff right, correct?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYup, the $125 million to $150 million is net of everything, that is physically what we expect to be able to bring back to the United States.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. Excellent. Great. And you talked about the pension being down, can you just remind me what those numbers are again? I think, you said about $119 million is where the pension liability is?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. The unfunded pension liability as of the end of '18 is now $122 million. That's down from $179 million at the end of last year.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. And then just your thoughts on how much kind of cash payments might be in this coming year related to that?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We have made some really good progress with some changes and modifications and a good asset performance as well. We expect it to be $8 million of cash outflow in 2019 and that is down $10 million from the '18 amount, which was an outflow of $18 million.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it, OK. And then you've referenced some of the -- of UK sale of another asset, have you quantified that yet and when do you expect that to close? And then other asset sales, are there still other asset sales you're pursuing as well?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. The property in the UK was at $12 million of proceeds. That was actually first quarter of last year. So, it's still being reported in our full-year numbers for 2018. So that is absolutely behind us. And we do have other smaller assets that we have. Part of our cost reduction activities has generated some closures of facility, some of those are leased, some of those are owned and we have generated proceeds, small individually, but we have generated proceeds from selling those facilities and we certainly continue to expect that smaller activity to continue as we move into 2019 and beyond, and we'll continue to look for other larger opportunities as well.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nAnd then the other larger opportunity, if you look at kind of pieces of your business and maybe Dan if you can chime in this as well, but are the pieces still -- that you feel or not essential to the core business that you could potentially monetize?\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Charlie. Dan, I'll take that one. Yeah. The short answer is yes. We talked about the sale of our Print Logistics being an important first step in our portfolio optimization efforts as we go forward looking to do two things as we reshape our core and rebuild for the future. Reshaping our core essentially means that, do we have the right mix of businesses that fits our strategy going forward and we believe we have some opportunities there. And the other part of building for the future is, we believe we need some additional capabilities to match up to the market opportunities we see ahead. So that the balance between those two of adding new capabilities and optimizing our core remain very much in our sites going forward.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGreat. And then lastly, Terry, on the -- you talked about additional cost reduction opportunities. I know, kind of, Q4 SG&A was basically flat with last year, it seems like that's kind of that program has ended, you can maybe talk about what are the opportunities to reduce SG&A going forward?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, when we talk about cost reductions, we actually referred to both those that hit our gross profit or cost of goods sold as well as the SG&A pieces and both of those generate meaningful savings for us. Neither one of those has hit the end. I will say that we had more favorable adjustments to some of our long-term incentive compensation last year than what we did this year that helped offset some of those reductions. But, again, if you look at the year, our SG&A is actually down about $30 million and over the past two years it's down about $66 million and that comes right off the face of our income statement. So those are still active, those are still generating and we will continue to drive those initiatives going into 2019 as well.\nThe other thing too that we really don't sweep into that discussion around cost savings, but it is very meaningful and I want to take a minute just to highlight it is, what we've done with interest expense. If you look at kind of our base year being that year of our spend, if we hit our guidance for next year, we will have reduced our interest expense annually by about $40 million. So that's another really big meaningful contributor to bottom line results. It's just not part of our margins above, but still nonetheless we put a lot of energy in managing that element of the income statement as well. So $40 million is what we're looking at; $30 million of that has already reflected in our 2018 results and almost another $10 million is what's guided for next year, which brings it to $40 million.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Charlie, it's Dan. I would just add to, by no means, are we done exploring opportunities to further reduce our cost to serve, in particular, as it relates to the SG&A front. And our efforts heretofore has been to eliminate redundant activities, consolidated activities within SG&A and other parts of our platform. I think the real opportunity that we're proceeding with and pursuing going forward is really using technology around AI, around machine learning to actually changes the way that we are performing a number of those activities and automate a significant number of standard rinse and repeat type of functions that are being performed. So by no stretch imagination have we stopped pursuing or will we stop pursuing those opportunities. There is investments that are not going to be required to automate a lot of that stuff, but it remains a very front and center for us as a company to lower our overall cost to serve.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nExcellent. Thanks. I'll jump back in queue.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of David Phipps representing Citi. Please go ahead.\nDavid Phipps -- Citi -- Analyst\nHi. Thank you very much for taking my questions and clarifying the organic growth. That's quite helpful. Can you -- we have all the data for the sales for the divested businesses, except for the second quarter, if you have that handy that'd be helpful for modeling and maybe why you're looking for that? The European business trend was plus 6.3% in the third quarter and reversed and went minus 5.7% in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about that a little bit?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. This is Terry. Thanks for the question, David. First of all, with the Print Logistics, for the first six months, that was $200 million last year, $107 million of which is in first quarter. So the balance of that will be your second quarter adjustment for modeling purposes there.\nAnd then what -- your second question again? (multiple speakers) The difference in trend there versus the past is in the fourth quarter, we have -- in the quarter we generally produce, in part of our business, the photo books, photo books as we move into the holiday season. That was actually off this quarter, that's kind of a one quarter where that volume is larger and we did as we put out a new product. We had some challenges with capturing those revenues this year that caused kind of a dip in those sales that impacted the European results. And, again, those results are smaller, smaller number, so a smaller impact, that's a greater percentage impact.\nDavid Phipps -- Citi -- Analyst\nAnd maybe some clarification on some of the guidance. So we've got an organic growth rate of sales about flat, given the adjustments? And if we start building EBITDA, which you don't directly reference, the things you would start with those adjusted operating income, which at midpoint is $245 million, the D&A of $175 million, so that gets you to $420 million, but there are typically some extra add backs into that number. Are there anything that you can call out that we should think about or is $420 million a reasonable baseline at midpoint?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNo, I do have one more thing to caught, you need to remember that, the other income line, which is where a lot of our pension income shows up. Last year, that number was $22 million, that needs to be added in there. And there is a couple -- we've given you enough information to kind of go out that EBITDA number a couple of different ways and you described probably the shortest and easiest way. But if you kind of look at the multiple ways to do that and kind of come up with an implied range, you'd see that the midpoint of that range to -- is roughly flat to what we delivered last year.\nDavid Phipps -- Citi -- Analyst\nOkay. That is fantastic. And the last -- you talked about some of the puts and takes of cash taxes being one of the impacts in the operating cash flow for this year. Can you -- and restructuring -- kind of what order of magnitude could we think about?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nCash taxes will have a slightly larger impact and the reference that I made to the relocation cost, the China costs associated with restructuring and the business, higher business costs during the transition; taxes, that will be a little bit higher than that. And then there is many things that actually offset both of those factors, one of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks, which was around lower pension and OPEB contributions, there's $10 million of savings there and we expect that funding level to improve even further from the that $8 million level once you go past 2019 and into 2020 and later years.\nDavid Phipps -- Citi -- Analyst\nAll right. Those are my questions. Thank you for your time.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAll right. Thank you.\nOperator\nNext, we'll have the follow-up from Jamie Clement with Buckingham. Please go ahead.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nYes. Hey. Good morning, again. Dan, one of the things I've always struggled in looking at RRD was trying to get a sense of like -- just like kind of how much paper exposure you actually have and given the shortages and the increases and those kinds of things, how -- like -- do you know a rough percentage in mind of -- how much your print business is for lack of a better word spot where you can kind of pass the stuff along plus business that is quasi contractual, where the contracts allow you to pass it along versus other business lines where you could try to pass it along, but you're just -- you're kind of -- you just have to kind of roll with it, you have to eat it. I know that's not a real specific question, but I'm trying to get my arms around that.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Jamie. So the short answer is, I don't have a number that breaks down from contracts between the contractual aspects of being able to pass along versus the spot piece of it, but not to add complexity to the question, but even in cases where you have the contracts, the contracts kind of govern the overall relationship. You're still...\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nRight.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n...competing on individual programs as they come through, right?\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nRight.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I think the -- but here it's just different business dynamics. If you look at the commercial print platform, more volatility within that. If you look at a statements platform where you're primarily running statements every month, you know what you're getting, you know what you're buying, you know what type of paper you're using, et cetera, et cetera. So significant differences between our product lines and businesses there too. But here's what I would tell you of how you should think about that. Regardless of -- so paper is an issue. It's been an issue all year, that's compounding effect of price increases has been a problem. And the way I would think about that is, in contracts -- I will breakdown a couple of forms. In contracts, where we have the ability to pass it along, oftentimes at, say, specific intervals.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nRight.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo as those intervals come up, we are pushing to pass that along. In other cases, where we're competing on transactional work that's in the marketplace, we're embedding those new prices into that transactional work that we're quoting in the marketplace. So, as you know, from your extensive experience covering the industry there's the lag there.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nYeah.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nBut rest assured, we are aggressively pursuing catching up to that lag with every contractual opportunity and with new work and new contracts that we are signing, and we believe we will make sizable progress on that over time.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nAye. And then switching to the other kind of major cost item that led not only R.R. Donnelley, but just that everybody else who puts ink on paper for a living as called that is obviously labor and obviously other industries have said the same thing. Is this -- are your retention rates still pretty strong, obviously tighter labor market, can you kind of give us a sense kind of that at the local level, like at the plant level, how that tighter labor market is kind of manifesting itself in terms of challenges of operations and that sort of thing?\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, sure. So I'll give you two-part answer to that, Jamie. The first answer is, historically, our turnover at the entry-level, unskilled level, has always been higher than our skilled level and once folks are here for a number of years, they tend to stay for quite a long time. With the recent labor shortage that has -- that dynamic has changed a bit at the skilled level where we are seeing a bit more turnover at the skilled level.\nThe other important -- the second important dynamic there is, it really is dependent upon the labor pool around the location of that particular -- around that particular facility. In some cases where they are in small communities, the labor pool is not very large. So that turnover is much more impactful. In other cases, where they are in larger geographies, your ability to attract from other businesses and pull them into solve your shortfall takes time, but you have the better opportunity to do that.\nOne of the core elements for us in managing this going forward is looking at each of our individual locations to truly understand the labor dynamic that exist there. And a lot of cases changing our approach. So just as an example, if our skilled turnover is going higher and there is not a lot of opportunities for us within that local labor market to bring in skilled people, who can step right into that role, but obviously our focus on developing our own folks internally at much quicker into those skilled position becomes the utmost priority.\nSo we are -- the short answer is, we are seeing the impact of labor shortages. It has ticked up a bit on the skilled side. On the unskilled side, everybody is competing for the same base and there is less of a pool out there. So that's a challenging issue as well. But we are focused on developing labor strategies for each of our locations, because we think this will be here for a while.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd Jamie, this is Terry again. The other thing that's a bit more unique for us in the fourth quarter is the fact that we bring on historically and this year as well a lot of temporary labor to help with the seasonal demands of our business.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nYup.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd we saw very similar challenges there with the rates being higher, the availability of those temporary sources being more scarce than we've seen in the past and all of that, although more unique and specific to fourth quarter, certainly, we did see impact there as well in Q4 of 2018.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nSo, Terry, I'm going to take a shot at this. So if I look just big picture R.R. Donnelley, $6.8 billion of 2018 revenue versus 2017 of the margin compression that you saw, I mean would it be fair to say that were it not for paper and were it not for labor, your margins would have been up a lot year-over-year?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThey would have been up absolutely. I cited that as one of -- couple of key factors for why we missed the bottom end of our guidance, so that absolutely would have been the case. And, remember, fourth quarter of last year, we were seeing this issue in China, in particular, and then a little bit with their logistics business and the cost of transportation.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nYup.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe were seeing the paper inflation in China this time last year and that's over a couple of quarters, we worked that and we're able to successfully pass all of those increases on to our customers. So that's not impacting us anymore, but now it's more about doing and executing the same thing in the United States.\nJames Clement -- The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. -- Analyst\nThank you all very much for your time, as always.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Jamie.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Jamie.\nOperator\nOur final question today will come from the line of Charlie Strauzer representing CJS. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nHey. Just one follow-up. If you can talk about, maybe Terry can answer this, but we are starting to come up on lapping, I think the asset sales about midyear, specifically the Print Logistics business. Can you call out the impact by the quarter for Q1 and Q2 year-over-year decline there, if you have those numbers?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. On the revenue side, it's $107 million for Q1 and there would be about $193 million for -- I'm sorry $93 million for Q2, $200 million in total.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. And then roughly the EBITDA impact for each quarter?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThat was a low margin business for us. So that's much less of an impact than the revenue side. So smaller impact there plus they were battling cost of transportation increases last year, so low profitability there for that period.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. And then just thinking about Q1, how should we think about modeling kind of year-over-year, excluding Print Logistics just in terms of organic growth rates and then margins as well for that?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I take the -- like I mentioned in my remarks, I would -- we are expecting an organic decline, because that sourcing stuff is going to continue to come out in first quarter and our census work as well as new clients that we've been working for a couple quarters now and onboarding that will start to produce and generate what we expect to be an organic growth in the last half of the year. I cited a number of our cost factors, certainly some of China relocation is going to hit us in the -- even in the non-GAAP numbers too with outsourcing that print production, while we are moving that business. So our margins will be a little bit less for a very short period of time, but that will start to hit us in first quarter. We're continuing to work on passing along our inflationary cost increases, but that will progress as the quarter -- as we go through the quarter and into future quarters. So, bottom line, if we kind of take a small organic sales decline and adjust for some of these pluses and minuses, you're going to end up, we're expecting, an overall EPS mark that's pretty -- perhaps pretty close to where we were last year.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nSo, flattish EPS versus last year, maybe...\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nPlus or minus, a bit flattish, yeah.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nAnd flattish kind of EBITDA margins, do you think as well?\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOn EBITDA margin basis, that's yes, because last year would have had that client bankruptcy charge.\nCharlie Strauzer -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nTerry Peterson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nI'll turn the call back over to the speakers for final comments.\nDaniel Lee Knotts -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGreat.
