Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 4, our fourth-quarter results completed another year of record financial performance both from our underlying business and the incremental impact of our acquired Frank's and French's brands.\nWe continue to drive growth. And in 2018, we delivered double-digit sales, operating profit and earnings-per-share growth. We expanded operating margin while also making significant investments to drive continued growth. We delivered substantial cost savings in our seventh consecutive year of record cash flow.\nWe achieved our year one expectations from the acquisition of our Frank's and French's brands. Our sales growth and focus on profit realization from strong financial results across our consumer and flavor solutions segment and reflects the successful execution of our strategy and the engagement of our employees around the world. We have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, as seen on Slide 5, which we are continuing to grow. No matter where or what you choose to eat or drink, you're probably enjoying something flavored by McCormick every day.\nThis morning, you'll hear about our 2018 accomplishments, which were driven by successes across portfolio. Our investments in new products, brand marketing, capabilities and infrastructure continue to drive growth across our categories. In our consumer segment, we had strong U.S. consumption growth, and our Asia Pacific region had another year of outstanding growth.\nIn our flavor solutions segment, we continue to win with customers, driving base business and new product growth. We also continued our progress on expanding our portfolio with flavor growth, a pure and low margin ingredient business. We have a full year of our Frank's and French's brand impacting our business, not only in retail condiments and sauces and branded treats service, but now in other categories as well with our Frank's expansion beyond liquids. Growth in these brands accelerated over the course of the year, and we're excited about their trajectory.\nOverall, we're confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio continues to position us to fully meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. Heading into 2019, I'm confident our momentum will continue. This morning, I will begin with fourth-quarter results, reflect on our 2018 achievements and then share with you some of our 2019 business plan. After that, I will turn it over to Mike, who will go to more depth on the quarter-end results and the details of our 2019 guidance.\nLet's start with our fourth-quarter results on Slide 6. Starting with our top line. Versus the year ago period, we grew sales 1% for the total company, including a 1% unfavorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew sales 2%, with all regions in both segments contributing to the increase.\nDespite the significant trade inventory reductions in the U.S., sales growth was driven by brand marketing support, expanded distribution, new products and pricing. In our consumer segment, we grew our constant-currency sales 2% in the fourth quarter. In the Americas, we grew 1%, driven by pricing. We believe we substantially under-shipped consumer consumption due to trade inventory reductions.\nWe estimate this resulted in the negative 3% impact to the Americas growth rate for the quarter. A portion of this reduction was due to a change in a large retail replenishment system, which caused supply chain with disruption in November. We continue to work collaboratively with this retailer restock their stores. Overall, this customer, as well as some other retailers, the trade inventory reductions resulted in significant out-of-stock situations on high-margin quality items, therefore negatively impacting our fourth-quarter adjusted operating income.\nDespite these out of stocks, our IRI data shows U.S. prices in seasonings scanner sales through multi-outlets grew approximately 3% for both the category and McCormick-branded, supported by strong holiday advertising and merchandising execution and reflected improving share trends. Additionally, we had strong growth in unmeasured channels, including club, e-commerce and Hispanic retail chains. We also had strong consumption growth in other parts of our U.S.-branded portfolio.\nAnd combined with spices and seasonings, we achieved our best fourth-quarter consumption performance over the last five years. Our fourth-quarter IRI data shows total U.S.-branded measured consumption, excluding Frank's and French's, grew 4%. And we estimate, including unmeasured channels, total consumption grew 5%. We're seeing accelerated consumption trends driven by strong marketing and merchandising as well as new distribution.\nMcCormick-branded dry recipe mixes, Stubb's and Kitchen Basics stocks and broths all had high single-digit consumption growth, with dry recipe mix and Stubb's outpacing their respective categories and Kitchen Basic going in line in its category. We're also seeing accelerating trends for Frank's RedHot sauce and French's since we acquired these brands. During the fourth quarter, our IRI data shows Frank's consumption grew 9%, outpacing its category. We continued our sequential improvement on French's mustard.\nMustard volume consumption grew in the quarter, and total dollar consumption growth was in line with the category. This was the best performance of both Frank's and French's mustard since the acquisition. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, the EMEA region, constant-currency consumer sales growth was driven by new products, an increase in brand marketing support and continued momentum in France. And in the Asia Pacific region, our consumer segment momentum continued with double-digit constant-currency growth and increases across all categories and channels.\nThe fourth-quarter constant-currency sales growth was the best sales performance in both regions for the year. Turning now to the flavor solutions segment. We grew sales 3% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, with all three regions benefiting from higher volume. In the Americas, we grew in all trend areas, such as snack seasoning and savory flavors.\nWe continue to work with our customers, particularly those experiencing several historic challenges to provide flavor solutions that deliver clean label and better-for-you attributes. Across all regions, we grew with Quicksilver's restaurants, driven by both new customers and new products as well as existing business. And as we continue to refine and optimize our portfolio, the fourth quarter as well as the full year is impacted by the exit of lower-margin business. Our fourth-quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share results had significant negative impact from the trade inventory reductions I mentioned a moment ago.\nBut the bottom line, our fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.67, compared to $1.54 in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase of 8% was driven primarily by favorable adjusted income tax rate and included an unfavorable impact from currency. Moving from our fourth-quarter results. I'm pleased to share performance for the full fiscal year starting with our strong financial results as seen on Slide 7.\nWe drove 11% constant-currency sales growth with the incremental sales from our acquired Frank's and French's brands contributing 8% of this growth. Our underlying base growth increased 3%, driven by new products, brand marketing investments, expanded distributions and pricing actions to offset material cost increases. Our consumer segment grew sales 10% in constant currency, led by the Frank's and French's acquisition impact and underlying base growth driven by the U.S. and China.\nConstant-currency sales growth in our flavor solutions segment was 11%, also led by incremental sales from Frank's and French's. All three regions delivered flavor solutions base growth including our exit of some lower-margin business. We grew constant-currency adjusted operating income 19%, driven by higher sales and 180 basis points adjusted gross margin expansion from CCI-led savings and our portfolio shift. This increase, combined with a lower adjusted effective tax rate, was partially offset by higher interest expense and shares outstanding, drove 17% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $4.97 for fiscal 2018.\nThis increase in, includes the impact of favorable currency exchange rates versus last year. With higher sales, CCI and portfolio shift, we increased our adjusted operating margin to 17.4%, which was a 110-basis-point expansion from last year. We expanded adjusted operating margin in both of our segments. And in record-high -- we're also making investments to drive continued growth.\nWe reached a record $118 million of annual cost savings, led by our CCI program, our fuel for growth, and are well on our way toward exceeding our full-year $400 million goal, and we realized $344 million over the past three years. 2018 was the seventh consecutive year of record cash flow from operation, ending the year at $821 million. We're making great progress with our working capital improvement and expect the programs we have put in place to continue the momentum into 2019. At year-end, our board of directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend, marking our 33rd consecutive year of dividend increases.\nWe've paid dividend every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. Now I'd like to comment on some of our 2018 achievements beyond our financial performance. We've successfully completed the integration of our Frank's and French's acquisition and celebrated the acquisition 1-year anniversary. We created value, achieved synergies and are obtaining results according to our acquisition plan.\nImportantly, we have achieved year one sales and earnings per share accretion expectations. With strengthening distribution, category management, effective brand marketing investments and innovation, we're successfully growing Frank's and French's. As Mike will mention in more detail, we've also made great progress in paying down our acquisition debt and finish the year ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target. A key driver of sales growth was our brand marketing, which was up 18% over 2017.\nOur leadership in digital was reworded again in 2018 with recognition as the top 3 brand by Gartner LT Research of their Digital IQ Index. This marked our fifth consecutive year in the top 5 ranking of over 100 food and beverage brands in the effectiveness of our websites, digital, social media and e-commerce. Our investments and constant development, resources to support accelerate as well as progress of items tailored to the e-commerce channel are paying off. We improve local e-commerce sales 41%, driven by strong omnichannel performance.\nIn the second half of 2018, we began increasing the level of our technology investments as we modernize our information technology systems around the world to a single global platform, including starting the replacement process of our existing ERP system. This will allow us to align our global operating model end-to-end processes, simplify our work, better manage risks, and importantly, to enable growth. In 2018, we continue to invest further on our global footprint by increasing our capacity to support our growth in the Asia Pacific zone. We opened a new regional manufacturing facility in Thailand to expand both production capacity and capability to support growth segments growth plan in Southeast Asia.\nWe continued progressing on our global progress to upgrade the modern environment. In the second half of 2018, we opened a new Lean-certified global headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland, which enabled us to bring nearly 1,000 employees from four different Maryland-based office buildings into one location. The new headquarters incorporates open space, technology-enabled and accommodates the way employees want to work today and into the future. It fosters a greater collaboration and engagement and helps us attract and retain the best talent.\nAnd finally, we're making measurable progress toward our 2025 sustainability goals. And in addition, we committed that by 2025 100% of our plastic packaging will be reusable, recyclable or able to be repurposed. We are being recognized for our efforts in sustainability. Just two days ago, at the 2019 Davos World Economic Forum, McCormick was named by Corporate Knights and our 2019 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations index, ranking us No.1 in the food products industry for the third consecutive year and No. 13 overall. And we were included on the very inaugural 100 Most Sustainable Companies List in 2018. Additionally, we're diversity Top 50 Companies for the second consecutive year, which is a testament to our emphasis on embracing and leveraging diversity and inclusion globally.\nMike will deliver our 2019 guidance in a few moments, but I'd like to mention a few highlights related to our sales growth and plan and provide some summary comments on Slide 10. As the foundation of our sales growth rate is the rising global consumer demand for great taste and healthy eating. Consumers have increased interest in creating flavor experiences of bold, which authentic flavors, while also demanding convenience. Additionally, consumers are focused on fresh, natural and recognizable ingredients with greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food.\nFlavor continues to be an advantaged global category, and our products inspire flavor exploration and are the essential complement to fresh real food. We deliver flavor across all markets and all channels and are aligned with the consumers' demand for flavor, convenience, health and sustainably minded business practices. Our alignment with these long-term trends, our breadth and reach, combined with our execution against effective strategies, positions us well to meet increased consumer demand both through our products and through our customers product and drive sales growth. In 2019, we'll continue to differentiate our brand, build capabilities and make investments for growth that will continue to move us going forward.\nAcross both segments, we have confidence in our ability to drive sales through strong brand marketing program, continued focus on customer intimacy, our opportunities to expand distribution, and of course, new products. New products are integral to our sales growth. In 2018, 8% of our sales were from product launches in the last three years. In 2019, we expect new product sales growth to be even higher because in 2018 we refocused on integrating and growing Frank's and French's.\nIn our consumer segment, new product innovation is an important way to differentiate our brand and stay relevant with the consumers. We have a robust global pipeline of new product launches in 2019 that resonates brand, inspire flavor exploration and experimentation and meet the demand for convenience, health and transparency. And in our flavor solutions segment, we will continue to capitalize on our culinary foundation and customer collaboration, both of which differentiates us with customers. This unique combination allows us to continue our new product momentum as our customers continue to review their portfolios to on-trend flavors and more natural and better-for-you products while ensuring that taste is not compromised.\nWe're looking forward to sharing more details regarding our 2019 growth plan and market dynamics in just a few weeks at CAGNY. To summarize, on Slide 11, before turning it over to Mike, we achieved top-tier financial results in 2018 delivered by both strong underlying business performance and the incremental impact of our acquisition of the Frank's and French's brands and there's lighting strong momentum in sales growth. In the consumer segment, we finished the year with strong total U.S. consumption and fourth-quarter growth in our VMA and APV regions with the highest of the year.\nIn our flavor solutions segment, we continue to grow through winning new customers on new products and existing business. We're balancing our resources and efforts to grow sales in our work to lower cost to build fuel for growth and higher margins. We have a solid foundation. And in a environment that continues to be dynamic and fast-paced, we are ensuring we remain agile, relevant and focused on long-term sustainable growth.\nOur experienced leaders and employees are executing against our strategies, which are designed to build long-term value for our shareholders. And with our 2018 results, they have again proven to be effective. We are confident that the effectiveness will continue in 2019. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the globe and thank them for their efforts and engagement which drive our momentum and make us succeed.\nLooking forward, with this engagement and our effective strategies and momentum, we are well-positioned to achieve continued growth in 2019. Thank you for your attention. And it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike for additional remarks on our 2018 financial results and the details on our 2019 guidance. Mike?\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now comment on our fourth-quarter performance and full-year results as well as providing more detail on our 2019 outlook. Starting on Slide 13. During the fourth quarter, we grew sales 2% in constant currency.\nBoth our consumer and flavor solutions segment delivered top-line constant-currency growth in each of our three regions. The consumer segment grew sales 2% in constant currency. This growth was driven by all three regions with strong growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA. On Slide 14, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 1% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThis increase was driven by pricing actions. Volume growth was flat due to trade inventory reductions, as mentioned by Lawrence. In EMEA, constant-currency consumer sales were up 3% from a year ago, primarily driven due to broad-based volume and product mix growth, driven by brand marketing support as well as new products in the U.K. and continued momentum in the organic product line in France.\nPartially offsetting this growth was the pricing impact of trade promotional activities related to new products. We grew consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region 10% in constant currency, led by China growth, with strength in new World Flavor sauces, ketchup, chicken bouillon as well as herbs and spices. Turning to our flavor solutions segment and Slide 17. We grew fourth-quarter constant-currency sales 3%, which was attributable to broad-based growth across all regions.\nIn the Americas, flavor solutions constant-currency sales increased 2%, driven by increased sales to quick service restaurants and continued flavors momentum. This was partially offset by the elimination of some low-margin business as well as the global realignment of a major customer sales from the Americas to EMEA. In EMEA, we grew flavor solution sales 5% in constant currency. This increase was primarily driven by pricing as well as the previously mentioned global realignment of a major customer's sales from the Americas to EMEA.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, flavor solutions sales grew 3% in constant currency as higher sales to quick service restaurants were partially driven by the timing of promotional activity. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes the transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of our Frank's and French's brands and special charges, declined versus the fourth quarter of last year by 3%, which included a 1% unfavorable impact to currency. In the consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 3% to $228 million, which in constant currency was a 2% decline. The flavor solutions segment was also down 3% to $70 million.\nIn constant currency, that was a 1% decrease. The decline in both segments was partially due to unfavorable product mix, higher freight costs and investments to drive future growth. In the consumer segment, the unfavorable mix was primarily driven, as Lawrence mentioned earlier, by lower sales of high-margin holiday items due to trade inventory reductions. Our investments to drive future growth included an increase in brand marketing of 7% or $7 million versus the fourth quarter of last year.\nAnd we began the process to modernize our information technology systems, including the replacement of our ERP system. Additionally, the flavor solutions segment had an unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal year, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency was 19%, and we expanded adjusted operating income margin 110 basis points, with both segments contributing to the growth. The consumer segment grew constant-currency adjusted operating income 13%, while increasing our brand marketing and investments by 18%.\nThe flavor solutions segment grew constant-currency adjusted operating income 34% versus 2017. Our flavor solution strategy to migrate our portfolio to more value-added categories is evident in these results. The shift in our portfolio, combined with CCI, has increased flavor solutions adjusted operating margin to 14.2%, an expansion of 230 basis points in 2018. As seen on Slide 22, in the fourth quarter, adjusted gross profit margin, which excludes transaction and integration expenses, declined 30 basis points versus the year ago period, driven by unfavorable product mix, partially offset by CCI cost savings.\nWe ended the full year with a 180 basis points increase, driven by the accretion impact from the addition of Frank's and French's portfolio as well as CCI cost savings and favorable product mix across the core business. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased by 40 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. Leverage from sales growth and CCI-led cost savings was more than offset by increases in both brand marketing and freight expense as well as spending related to our information systems modernization. Below the operating income line, other income increased $7 million.\nThe increase in other income was driven due to a gain on the sale of a building we vacated as part of the office consolidation into our new global headquarters, which Lawrence mentioned earlier. The expenses we incurred related to the office consolidation reduced operating income for the year by approximately $4 million. Turning to income taxes on Slide 23. Our fourth-quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 19%, which reflects the favorable impact from a lower U.S.\ncorporate tax rate as compared to 26.2% in the year ago period. Our fourth quarter adjusted rate was lower than anticipated, due to the favorable impact of discrete items, principally a higher level of stock option exercises. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.6%, compared to 26.1% in fiscal 2017. Income from unconsolidated operations for both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the full year was comparable to the respective year ago periods.\nFor 2019, we expect a low single-digit increase in our income from unconsolidated operations. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, fourth-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.67, up 8% from $1.54 for the year ago period, mainly due to a favorable investment income tax rate. This increase included an unfavorable impact from currency. On Slide 26, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet.\nOur cash flow provided from operations ended the year at a record-high of $821 million, compared to $815 million in 2017. For the fiscal year, our cash conversion cycle was significantly better than year ago period, down 21 days, as we executed against programs to achieve working capital reductions, such as expanding payment programs with our suppliers and inventory management programs. We returned a portion of this cash flow to our shareholders through dividends. Additionally, we reduced our acquisition debt in the fourth quarter by $209 million, which brings our total acquisition debt reduction in the fiscal year to $545 million.\nAnd we have now paid down over 50% of the term notes related to the acquisition. We finished the year with a debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of four times, which is ahead of our target. This strong progress positions us well to achieve our three times target by the end of 2020. Our capital expenditures were $169 million in 2018 and included the completion of our regional manufacturing facility in Thailand and spending related to our new global headquarters.\nIn 2019, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2018 to support our investments to drive growth, particularly the transition of our ERP platform. We expect 2019 to be another year of strong cash flow, driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, making investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt. Let's now move to our current financial outlook for 2019 on Slide 27.\nWe are well-positioned for another year of solid performance with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization. As Lawrence mentioned, we continue to expect solid constant-currency growth for fiscal year 2019. We estimate based on prevailing rates a 2 percentage points unfavorable impact from currency rates on net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. We expect the impact of unfavorable currency will be greater in the first half of the year than in the second half.\nAt the top line, we expect to grow sales 1% to 3%, which in constant currency is a 3% to 5% projected growth rate. This increase will be entirely organic growth with no incremental impact from acquisitions. The growth will be driven primarily by higher volume and product mix as well as the impact of pricing to offset an anticipated low single-digit cost increase. Our 2019 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2018, in part driven by our CCI-led cost savings.\nWe expect to increase adjusted operating income 7% to 9% from $942 million in 2018, which in constant currency is a 9% to 11% projected growth rate and reflects our continued focus on profit realization. Our cost-savings target is approximately $110 million, and we expect brand marketing to be comparable to 2018. Our 2019 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to approximate 22% base upon our estimated mix of earnings by country in addition to our state tax rates. This projection is well within our underlying effective tax rate of 24%, due to the favorable impact of discrete tax items, which occurred during the first quarter of 2019, related to our entity structure.\nOur full-year 22% outlook versus our 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 19.6% is approximately 300-basis-point headwind to our 2019 adjusted earnings-per-share growth. Our guidance range for our adjusted earnings per share in 2019 is $5.17 to $5.27. This compares to $4.97 of adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and represents a 4% to 6% increase or 6% to 8% in constant currency. This increase includes expected significant tax headwind I just mentioned.\nIn summary, we are projecting solid growth in our 2019 constant-currency outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, following record double-digit performance across each objective in 2018. I'd like to let you know that we'll be adopting two new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2019 on a retrospective basis. With the adoption of these two standards, we expect no impact to net income and only a geography shift between income statement line items. We also do not anticipate the adoptions will materially impact growth rates or other expectations we provided in our 2019 financial outlook.\nThis morning, we have provided summary points regarding this topic in the appendix of our presentation, and further discussion of these changes will be included in the 10-K we filed this evening. On a final note related to our guidance, turning to Slide 28, I want to discuss our performance versus our constant-currency long-term financial objectives. We evaluate our performance against our long-term objectives every several years, partially because of the variability which can occur year to year related to acquisition activity. As a reminder, we have an objective to grow sales 4% to 6% with base business, new products and acquisitions each contributing one-third.\nSo excluding one-third from acquisitions, our growth expectations will be to grow sales approximately 3% to 4%. Additionally, our objective is to grow adjusted operating income 7% to 9%. Then by using leverage gained through our capital deployment activities, including our share repurchase program, our objective is to grow adjusted earnings per share 9% to 11%. As we have previously stated, after making our Frank's and French's acquisition, we have curtailed acquisition activity and our share buyback program as we delever and therefore use our cash flow to pay down debt.\nAs mentioned earlier, we are making significant progress to leveraging. And in line with our original plan, our acquisition activity and buyback program will remain curtailed in 2019. From a sales perspective, our 2019 guidance of 3% to 5% is in line with our long-term growth objectives without incremental acquisition growth. Our adjusted operating income guidance is 9% to 11%, which is actually above our long-term growth objectives.\nDespite these strong operating expectations, the adjusted effective income tax rate increase I mentioned before is a significant headwind to our 2019 adjusted earnings-per-share growth. Looking at our performance over a 4-year period, using the 2019 guidance I've just reviewed, our compounded annual growth rate for 2015 from before the Frank's and French's acquisition to 2019, the first full year these brands are in our base, are projected to exceed our long-term goals for each objective, even including the negative effect of currency experienced during this period. As Lawrence mentioned, our foundation is strong, our strategy is effective, and we are generating results in line with our objectives. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 29. We delivered another year of record results in 2018. Despite trade inventory reductions, we achieved strong organic sales growth for the year.\nWe significantly grew adjusted operating income while also increasing brand marketing and achieved Frank's and French's results in line with our plan. We ended 2018 with the strongest consumption trend in years in our consumer business and solid growth in every region for flavor solutions. Our 2019 constant-currency outlook reflects strong operating performance, driven by our solid foundation and continued momentum. Our earnings-per-share growth was robust despite a significant tax headwind, and we're confident that 2019 will be another successful year, and we will create additional volume.\nAnd importantly, we're continuing to deliver differentiated results while significantly investing for growth to build McCormick of the future. And we'll share more about these investments at CAGNY in a few weeks. And now let's turn to your questions. \nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nGood morning everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Andrew.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning.\nAndrew Lazar -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nHi. I guess -- first, I'm looking at was the replenishment issue that you talked about a key customer or customers. Were those really just in McCormick's category or categories? Or is this something you think we'll hear more about from peers as we go forward? And then a 3% headwind to Americas consumer that you mentioned is obviously a less of headwind to the overall business. It still seems like maybe organic sales growth, even excluding that, might have come in a little short of where like consensus was for organic sales growth in the quarter.\nI wonder if there are any additional areas that came in differently around the top line than may be you anticipated that are worth mentioning. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Andrew. I'm going to start with the first part of that question, the replenishment issue. There's been a general trend for all of our customers to be working their inventories lower, as you know, and others have reported on it. The particular issues that impacted us in the fourth quarter were -- really had two parts to it.\nThe first part was the move by a key customer as well -- and handful of key customers to reduce their inventory levels. Overall, it is on timing for them to do this for our category, but it may have made sense for them across their broader store. And for us, of course, the fourth quarter is the real peak. And I would expect you to hear from others saying similar things regarding that portion of the trade reduction.\nAnd I believe, actually, some of our peers have already commented on this and the costs those who have come ahead of us. There was a part of that was unique to us and that there was a large customer, who's name I'm not going to use, that had change in their internal store replenishment system. This was actually switched on in error by them. And so that had a big impact in that there warehouses and stores did not recognize each other's order numbers.\nAnd as a result, stores were not replenished. That's going to be a change that is unique to us. This customer is making that transition broadly, but it is for our category that was scheduled for much later next year. We would have run all the beta tests and so on and would have had a different experience, if had done in a different way.\nAnd again, it was an error internal hit, that the customer and we are still working through this in a sense that for every order we have to do literally a workaround to get the stores restocked. So that part is unique to us. We've highlighted this as a 3% headwind overall to our business in the -- in our Americas business in the quarter. We're not rounding up again to get to that number.\nWe have a pretty good handle on it, on our ability to quantify. It was holiday items. It was specific customers, and we really know what it was. Mike, do you want to go further on that?\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n[Inaudible]\nAndrew Lazar -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nGreat. I appreciate the details. See you in a couple of weeks.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nGreat. See you.\nAndrew Lazar -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nYes.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Crédit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nHi. I guess, I have two questions. The 9% to 11% constant-currency EBIT growth target for 2019 now sounds rather aggressive. Given that what's demonstrated here in fourth quarter, is that you ended a vulnerable to a lot of the trends that are happening across the food space.\nYou had inventory reductions. You mentioned some freight costs. And I just want to know how do you get from the sales guide to the EBIT guide? I know you have your normal cost-savings programs. But you also mentioned mix was a headwind in fourth quarter.\nWhy wouldn't it be a headwind in 2019? And then I have a follow-up.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nRob, this is Mike. I'll start this one. Let's talk about fourth quarter first, because you talked about -- when you talked about product mix in the fourth quarter. A significant portion of that is really related to the trade inventory issues.\nThese are our highest-margin holiday items, so that was a significant hit to our fourth-quarter operating profit. We also did take the opportunity in the fourth quarter we -- just like we did in the third quarter, we had some benefits from stock options, which is below the operating profit line. Some of these savings, we invested those in brand marketing, up 7%. We took opportunities, started investing in our IT refreshment programs.\nSo if you look at 2019, though, we've gone from the 3% to 5%, down to 9% to 11%. We talked about keeping brand marketing flat. We took the opportunity. As I said in the fourth quarter, really invest and drive back consumption in the fourth quarter, get it to a level we feel comfortable expanding in 2019.\nWhile we are getting to get more effective, and we're going to have more working media in 2019, that's going to give us about 100 basis points right there, keeping that flat. We're also getting more synergies from the Frank's and French's, the second year. That sort of have a wrap from last year and additional Frank's and French's synergies. Our CCI focus really is -- we look at cost of goods sold and SG&A, we're really leaning in there also.\nAnd some of the things happen in the fourth quarter, we talk about the move into the new building, we're not going to have those costs next year. So it's a variety of things that aren't going to happen in 2019 that we feel very strongly by giving this guidance.\nRobert Moskow -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOK. And then my follow-up is, I did an inventory report on the broader group back in October, and McCormick popped up as a company that had been shipping at a growth rate that was well above the Nielsen measured consumption for quite a while. You had called out that there are other channels that are not measured by Nielsen, so that was a big portion of the disconnect. And you also pointed out that -- you always do a conservative job of assuming inventory reductions during the course of the year.\nSo I guess, given what happened here in fourth -- how much comfort you have that you have could visibility of how much inventory is really at the trade? And that you head into 2019 and that this will truly prove episodic? Or have you assumed another inventory burn again in 2019? Thanks.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Rob. I'm going to take this to start. And Mike, join me if I miss anything on this. But this was an extraordinary situation.\nIt's not the normal pattern that we've experienced. Normally, we see a drawdown in Q1. Our Q1 that coincides with a lot of our customers end of the year and then relative flatness for the rest of the year. This impact that happened in fourth quarter was really extraordinary and does not reflect a build of inventory previously.\nThis is -- it's quite discrete with a small set of customers. We had one very large customer that had the biggest impact. It was devastating to their stores. They are -- it's inventory -- this was not an intentional move on their part.\nAnd as a result, their stores had tremendous out of stocks through the holiday season. And so it's hard to imagine that retailer taking inventory down further than they did because they literally ran themselves out of product. In terms of our -- looking forward, we always include in our plans and in our sales guidance level of inventory of drawdown, not always, but we had for the last several years. And we've included in the guidance for sales for next year further reduction in inventory across the trade, not necessarily those customers specifically.\nBut this timing that happened, both the size and the timing of it and the products involved, we're surprised this happened to us at the most sensitive time of year for us as we're coming to not, only the peak consumption period, but also the cutoff on our fiscal year. We don't get a do-over on Thanksgiving and so this had -- it really had a big impact for us.\nRobert Moskow -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst\nGood morning everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nAlexia Howard -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst\nHi. Could I ask about the flavor solutions business? It's -- up until this quarter, it was doing really incredibly well on profit growth, top-line growth. Clearly, the profits took a half bit of a pause on that trajectory this time around. Was there something that happened? Did the contracts got lost? Or is this just lapping tougher comps from a year ago? And what's the prognosis from here? Does it step down to some of a more normal level? Can the margins continue to expand? Thank you and I'll pass it on.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'll just say a word about this, then I'm going to give it to Mike. But the flavor solutions business is always pretty lumpy. And so there's more volatility in the quarter-to-quarter results on that. I think if you look at the whole year, we're very pleased that we don't see any issue.\nActually, are quite pleased with how we come out of the year on flavor solutions. And our outlook is as optimistic as it has been. Mike?\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I'd say within the flavor solutions business, a couple of things happened in the quarter and I mentioned this on the call. We have a bit a transactional FX unfavorability, which impacted not the whole company too from an operating-profit perspective. But because of our footprint with some of the currencies, but also unfavorable product mix.\nAnd some -- as Lawrence said, flavor solutions can be lumpy. And some of our regions, the growth was more on core products versus LTOs. LTOs generally have higher margins, so you have these sometimes when our customers' advertising something we've done for a long time as the base product that has a lower margin. That might have a little bit of a product mix negative, so we saw some of that this quarter, too.\nAlexia Howard -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst\nThank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nHey, David? Are you there.\nOperator\nMr. Driscoll, your line is live. Perhaps you're muted on your end.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nJust we go on to the next question and give David the opportunity to come in.\nOperator\nThank you .Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman -- J.P. Morgan Equity Research -- Analyst\nHi, thanks so much. A couple for me. In each of the last, I think, seven years by our math, your initial guidance for your tax rate has proven a bit conservative. Meaning, you've guided to a higher tax rate than, I guess, what you ultimately reported.\nJust wondering is there any reason we should think 2019 will be different? Given history, it seems reasonable to expect your tax rate to come in below the 22% you guided to today, but just trying to get a feel for what you're thinking there this coming year.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nDavid, this is Mike. I'll take this one. We generally -- we don't -- sorry, can't. I was on...\nKen Goldman -- J.P. Morgan Equity Research -- Analyst\nClose enough. I'll take it.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nClose enough. We know the difference. Yes, we have been favorable on our tax, but a big part of that is we don't forecast discrete tax items. But if you think about this year -- I'm talking about this year first before I talk about next year.\nBefore the Tax Act, we might have an underlying rate of 28% to 29%. And guidance at the beginning of this year after the Tax Act was about 24%. And we came in slightly below 20%, so about a 400 basis points favorability. 300 basis points of that was a stock option exercises, which, one, we don't forecast for.\nAnd we don't know when it's going to happen. So there's another 100 basis points of other stuff, tax settlements, things like that, but we really don't forecast discrete tax items. For '19, the underlying tax rate is about 24%, similar to this year, as we kind of go through -- also a process recently going through the regs that were just released by the Department of Treasury. We did some tax planning.\nAnd that's why we said, \"Look, this is significant tax item hitting early in the year.\" We're calling 22%. There could be some stock option exercises. There could be some other discrete tax items, but we want to give you at least a benchmark of what we see is there. And hopefully, it is favorable, but we -- there's some judgment there.\nKen Goldman -- J.P. Morgan Equity Research -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. No, very helpful, Mike. My follow-up is, you talked about low single-digit raw material cost inflation for the year. Forgive me.\nI don't think that includes transportation costs. And correct me if I'm wrong, but you're of the first food companies to really provide detailed guidance for the upcoming calendar year. I'm just curious on that freight for the transportation logistics whatever you want to sort of defined, I don't think raw material necessarily, if you're seeing any sort of easing and pressure from that area?\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNo, we throw it all in there.\nKen Goldman -- J.P. Morgan Equity Research -- Analyst\nWe do. OK, good.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, we throw it all in.\nKen Goldman -- J.P. Morgan Equity Research -- Analyst\nAnd if I could ask a quick clarification then just within that, just to get a better sense of transportation, are you seeing an easing in that particular part of it?\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, we've seen -- we know '18 was a significant increase from '17. And we've had a lot of activities in our North America, primarily through CCI program to mitigate the cost as we see them going to 2019. But we still do see inflation there.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe were not seeing an easing there.\nKen Goldman -- J.P. Morgan Equity Research -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nYes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nAdam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nMaybe a question just on the trajectory first on organic both on the fourth quarter and then into '19 on the Frank's and French's business because they are now in the organic base. Just trying to make this aggregate that the inventory trade reduction in the quarter, which clearly impacted the consumers Americas business, but would have thought that the Frank's and French's now coming into organic would have been -- would have helped your business reported into more. And just help me think about how those business are performing on underlying business. It sounded like the trade reductions were more legacy of McCormick guidance.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'm glad you asked that question because in answering a couple of the earlier questions about the inventory reductions, we didn't talk about the other side of the -- of what was happening, which is our consumption has been incredibly strong. We came out of the year with the strongest consumption performance for a fourth quarter in the last five years. It's one of the strongest quarters for a period. And that's part of what gives us optimism around 2019.\nThe Frank's and French's items were no exception to that. So our consumer offtake is, as measured through scanner data, on Frank's was up 9% in the quarter. Our offtake on mustard was almost flat. And if you recall, our goal that we announced when we bought this business was that we were going to drive growth on Frank's, and we were going to stabilize the French's mustard.\nAnd I think we're making great progress on that. And so I think that, that consumption trajectory on both the acquired brands and also on our core business gives us confidence in the sales numbers for 2019. Mike, do you want to make some comments on the inventory...\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, Yes. Let me talk to about in the fourth quarter, some of that advertising investment was driving Frank's. We talked about the first time we advertised in Frank's in seven years. The new advertising, which just dropped this week, that's kind of supports the first quarter.\nA lot of new products coming in the first quarter. Frank's and French's was impacted, as Lawrence said, by the trade inventory reductions though, but we expect the strong first quarter from both brands because of the consumption we're seeing.\nAdam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK. And then just on the guidance. Between the sales and margin expansion goals that you've laid out, is there any notable delineation between the consumer and the flavor solutions business, and i.e. is the base expectation that there's faster growth in flavors or consumer, more margin expansion of one versus the other?\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNo. We generally feel pretty comfortable between the two.\nAdam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK. That's -- it's very helpful. I'll pass it on.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHey, David, are you there this time?\nDavid Driscoll -- Citi Research -- Analyst\nYes, I'm here this time I apologize the telecom blitz right there. It was like one second before you call my name. So OK, two questions for you. You talked about the ERP system.\nWe're sensitive to changes in ERPs. Can you just walk us through kind of the risk points on when we need to be focused on the big modules and kind of when they come into play? And I think you called it out in the fourth quarter as part of it. I don't know what's already taken place versus what has to take place on the system change.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, David, as you know, this is kind of a two to three-year process. We're kind of in the early days year. Anything -- I wouldn't -- your guidance considers any expense that are going to occur on ERP. A lot of it is capital.\nAnd we talked about in the call we're going to have an increase in capital versus this year. Our capital this year, we have a target of $200 million due to a lot of timing issues, it came down to almost about $170 million. We don't see it -- we see some incremental capital investment next year, but I wouldn't describe a large impact. I mean our guidance is our guidance, and it incorporates all those impacts.\nDavid Driscoll -- Citi Research -- Analyst\nLet me clarify...\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nAs we get more detail, David -- I'll commit to give you more detail. But as I've said before, we're pretty early days on this but we have made some investments in the fourth quarter to help jump-start that.\nDavid Driscoll -- Citi Research -- Analyst\nYes, it wasn't really a question on capital spending. It was a question on ERP systems and the disruptions that they sometimes cause when the execution doesn't go well. There's always certain modules within these ERP systems that are far more sensitive than other modules. And I was just looking for a piece of information related to when the significant modules go into play.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, if I could just pick this up. So as you know, these -- it sounds like you understand exactly what's involved in these projects. So there was a long period of scoping, of code writing, building, before you get your first go-live on anything. So we're in that upfront stage of it right now.\nOur first go-live is not until 2020. But this year is the year when we do all of the work getting ready. And I'll just add to it, that we're due for it. We did our first SAP go-live in 2002.\nWe still have done some go-lives on SAP. This year has been a long and drawn out process. But once the new system is now become the legacy system SAP, as you know, goes out of maintenance, it becomes obsolete in 2023, we want to be ahead of the curve like getting -- migrating to the next generation of ERP, not be doing it at the last minute. So everybody's going to have to make this.\nAnybody is on SAP is going to have this transition over the next several years. We're really getting started some on it. Didn't incur some expense, but we got -- in the fourth quarter and will throughout 2019. But we really want -- we won't get until our first actual go-live until 2020.\nI'll add that it is our plan to move quickly. It's taken almost 20 years to roll out SAP across our whole company. We are not going to take 20 years to do the refresh, which will still be on SAP product\nDavid Driscoll -- Citi Research -- Analyst\nKind of like the 20-year comment. My second question relates to your flavor solutions. It's a follow-up to one of the earlier questions, but I want to think a little bit longer term. Flavor solutions margins went from about 7.5% five, seven years ago to over 14%, a massive increase.\nWhen I look at this the pie breakdown, your ingredients proportion of the flavor solutions is kind of small now. So I think that was the low-margin stuff that you slowly but surely been exiting and then adding other high-margin pieces like flavors. Lawrence, what I don't get a sense on, but I get this question a lot from investors, is how much more is there to go? Can you double the size of the flavors portion of flavor solutions? And is that high enough margin to keep pushing the segment margin significantly higher over some course of time? This isn't a the next year question.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nI understand. This is a great long-term question, and I appreciate the opportunity to talk about something besides the inventory reduction in the fourth quarter. This is the -- in fact, our strategy that you just described for our flavor solutions segment, we are downgrading our portfolio to more of the flavor and seasoning. We certainly see value on some of the customer foodservice products and condiments that we do, but away from that or come out of the ingredient and spectrum.\nAnd we see a long runway of opportunity of enhancing our margin from this migration of our portfolio to now value-added products. You can see from the public company competitors who are more pure play on flavor, their margins are significantly higher to us. And as we aspire to move more in that direction, and I'm not sure how high up is, but it's a long way from where we are now. And there are parts in the other slices of pie, too, for example, in condiments.\nThere's low-margin condiments and higher-margin so obviously, we would optimize this as we go.\nDavid Driscoll -- Citi Research -- Analyst\nThank you guys.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, David.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nHi, good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Chris.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nI had just two questions, if I could. So the price is a little less than I expected in the fourth quarter. I know you talked about some new products and spending around those new products. I'm sure it was more of effect on weight on pricing as more promotional-driven.\nSo my question is, did pricing line up with cost inflation in the fourth quarter? Do you expect that '19 or maybe more new product cost is going to weigh on that pricing line overall?\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Chris, this is Mike. I'll take that. If you look at the split by region, I don't focus on consumer, I mean pricing for consumer is only up 0.2%. But in the Americas, it was up 0.6.\nAnd that was covering the cost of inflation, some of the pricing we took early in the year, recipe mixes. Asia Pacific 1.5. EMEA, where we had really strong overall sales performance from kind of the relaunch of our first choice spice line, we had obviously some trade promotional slotting, key things like that, which is negative on price. So EMEA was negative 2.2.\nSo that's what drove the whole consumer down, and that was a significant restage for that region. So we don't see -- we see in '19 our pricing actions, the ramp from last year and anything we need to do to cover our low single-digit cost inflation, we see those covering off.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nRight. Other than the cost of new distribution, we don't see any extraordinary pressure on promotion expense, if anything, to revenue management. That's been a net positive for us.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nAnd with pricing also cost inflation in your view, that from a higher level in 2019, is that your expectation?\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'm sorry. I'm not sure I got the question. Could you repeat that?\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nWould -- do you expect your price realization to offset cost inflation in 2019 from a high level, not quarter-to-quarter, that kind of thing? But do you expect that we will be able to price to your cost inflation in 2019?\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. We also have CCI programs, things like that to -- there's a broad basket of tools.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nOK, yes. And just one final one. In the fourth quarter, I think you had a gain on the sale of a building, also had some costs related to moving into the new facility. Were there cost out of the quarter, in this fourth quarter had that benefit of that gain.\nAnd I'm just curious how this applies to the comps for 2019.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nChris, they were in the second half, we figured we moved most of the people in the, July, August, September timeframe and had a grand opening actually in October. So a lot of those expenses were second half.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nAnd the gain, did that more than offset the cost or?\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, it does. Yes, we said that in the call, between net to $2 million.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n$4 million spent hurt operating expense. There is a geography difference there that opposite. The gain was below the operating profit line, but all the expenses were above.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nOK. That's helpful. Thank you so much for your time.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you Good morning. Hello. I have two, hopefully, it's really quick couple of questions.\nFirst question is just any color, I know you don't always obviously don't guide quarter-to-quarter, but just any color around kind of cadence for '19, well, I guess, with respect to organic sales trajectory sequentially and then also just a margin. It looks like your guidance is -- implies, call it, about 100 basis points operating profit margin. I know you said earlier in response to a question it's not hard to get there, just given -- keeping the media spend flat. I'm curious like, obviously, just every year if you report Q4, you're already half of Q1.\nAnd given this holiday issue and some of the replenishment piece was for -- your quarter ending in November and then you also have December baked in Q1. Do some of that -- some of the replenishment issue flow through into Q1? And then does more of the margin expansion more back-half-loaded just given timing of '18 spend and then also the inventory issue you had in Q4? Sorry, if that's not worthy. Did you get my point?\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThat's right. I think we got the concept, Rob. This is Mike. I'll start this with we do not provide guidance by quarter, however, talk about 2% FX unfavorable during the year.\nThat's really first-half-loaded, so there's really going to be some negative FX there. First quarter is our smallest issue, as Lawrence said -- smallest quarter, right? No, our first quarter is our smallest quarter of the year. We are still working through some of the replenishment issue, but we also talked about how the first quarter discrete tax items so that's going to help our tax line. We'll make some investments.\nAs we talked about before, it's really like an IT and other things early in the year, being the smallest quarter of the year, there may be more impact on that. But again, for the full year, 100 basis points increase in operating profit. We're comfortable with that.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I'll say, there may be -- as we look ahead to some events that might happen in this volatile environment such as Brexit, we may -- depending on how they are unfolding, we may have to incur some expense to prepare us for managing our risks through our Brexit, for example.\nRob Dickerson -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nYes, I just mean potential outside total manufacturing, sourcing or...\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, inventory build, things like that. Yes.\nRob Dickerson -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nYes. OK. Fair. And then second question just more so on RB Foods.\nI realized some additional growth coming from non-track channels and non-track channels, it looks like year-over-year growth, definitely so strong or better even with Frank's so that's net positive. It looked like it peaked more in that August-September period year over year. And then French's, as you said, is stabilizing but still a drag. So I'm just curious, with respect to '19, didn't hear a lot or anything on potential innovation around the growing season.\nHow do you actually increase momentum behind the French's? And then secondly, just international opportunity which you didn't discuss upfront on the acquisition. I think the last call, but didn't hear much of that today. I hope that's more CAGNY-related things.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nRight. Yes, Rob, exactly I think we'll cover this more thoroughly at CAGNY. We'll look look at our and we'll talk more about our 2019 plans and beyond at CAGNY. But we're really pleased with the performance of RB Foods.\nI don't want to let this go, but I'm saying that. And you mentioned our peak around August. Actually, our consumption on these products increased sequentially quarter by quarter throughout the entire year. The fourth-quarter consumption was the strongest that we've had, but there was impact from that inventory issue on the purchase Frank's and French's brand.\nI actually don't have it at my fingertips, but the shipment was the -- consumer offtake was the strongest that we've had. And we think we've got good momentum going forward in 2019 on those brands, which we're now not really -- we're not breaking them out because we're treating them just like many of our other major brands in terms of our reporting. But when I say major brands, these are the second and third-largest brands in our portfolio after McCormick so they certainly get a lot of attention. Mike, do you want to?\nRob Dickerson -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nFair enough. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Feeney -- Consumer Edge Research -- Analyst\nA couple of questions. First, I guess, following up from your conversation with Rob and your comment that -- Rob Moskow, I should say, and your comment on consumption. It sounds like -- because I'm looking at the measured data, it sounds like non-measured -- this was a record Q4 for you. Non-measured continues to grow terrifically for you.\nIf you could just comment on non-measured, especially online, how that's going fiscal third versus fiscal fourth. And then second question is what are the big sources of gross margin mix? And within that, what impact on the gross margin specifically or how big of an impact could this one set of seasonal high-margin items have had on your gross margin broadly? It seems like there's other gross margin mix items that are more structural and maybe comment on how those play into your hope -- your plans for gross margin expansion in 2019. Thank you very much.\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'm going to start, and I'm going to pass it over to Mike. But the strong consumption includes unmeasured channels, but we're specifically pointing to the measured channels so that everybody could see it. So if you look at the IRI data in aggregate over the last -- going back five years, it seems that through measured channels, this was the strongest fourth quarter in the last five years. And then on top of that, we had good performance in our unmeasured channels as well the contributed.\nI think I tried to cover that in my prepared remarks, but I want to really underscore that you can see it in the measured data when you look at -- for us, IRI, the impact...\nJonathan Feeney -- Consumer Edge Research -- Analyst\nBut would that also be true? Would that also be true that -- that comment would be also be true on your nonmeasured channels that acceleration there?\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'm not sure that the growth rate was higher, but it was definitely a contributor to the positive growth and at a higher rate than the scanned sales. Some just go -- put that out there. Now the margin impact is -- from the [Inaudible] again, I can't underestimate -- Mike talked about this a little bit. This happened at the worst possible time for us, and the items that we have, the holiday time are very seasonal in nature.\nThey are our highest margin part of the portfolio. If you thought -- John, you followed us for a long time. You see the difference in our margin structure quarter by quarter. That's driven by that sort of holiday items.\nWhen we don't have that, that's a big impact on the bottom line.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, that's basically why. I mean there's are a high-margin items. Seems like French's some of the trade inventories and then you say inventory items we talked about, too, things like the recipe mixes, core herbs and spices. Those are -- If you look at it quarter by quarter, as Lawrence said, fourth quarter is always our highest quarter and atually, late in the quarter is usually higher.\nJonathan Feeney -- Consumer Edge Research -- Analyst\nMike, could I say that was a primary contributor then to gross margin contraction, that one issue?\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, definitely, definitely.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentleman, our final question for this morning will come from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.\nAkshay Jagdale -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks for squeezing me in. So one follow-up goes back to, I think, Andrew's first question. I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but for the fourth quarter, we have the benefit of quarter 3 guidance given how you guide, right? So the sales growth in the quarter was about 300 basis points below what you had expected. So the inventory stuff that's about 100, 150 bps, it does imply that something else was weaker, but it -- from everything you've said, it sounds to me like the main issue really is still the inventory issue, right? So can you just help me bridge that? Because it does look like from a purely quantitative standpoint, there are some other factors that have -- might have been weaker than you would had expected.\nThank you and I'll pass it on.\nMike Smith -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAkshay, this is Mike. And for the year, we gave guidance of 12 to 14. And we came in basically at the bottom of that, 11.9. The implied guidance for the fourth quarter was 0.9% to 7.4%.\nPretty big range because we don't take the year guidance down to 1% spread. We came in at 0.6% reported. So we were right at the bottom. The trade inventory programs were 1.5% impact or so.\nwhen you think about $20 million to $25 million of net sales, that would have put us up in that 0.9% to 7.4%. So I think we are comfortable with the guidance we were giving for the fourth quarter, implicit in our full-year guidance. So a little bit at the low end of the range, but we would have been well within the Q4 implied guidance.\nAkshay Jagdale -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGot it. So overall, the main standout is this inventory issue and what gives you confidence is clearly the consumption trends are very, very strong and accelerating in many areas? That's the main takeaway from your perspective on sales, right?\nLawrence Kurzius -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer\nAbsolutely. That's exactly right. Because in the long run, sales are being followed by consumer and that's why we spent so much time in our remarks today on the consumption trends. And while the trade inventory reduction happened at the worst time for us, we're very disappointed and the impact that it had at the end of the year, our consumer consumption is strong.\nAnd our international business is strong. And our flavor solutions business continues to power on. We believe there's a short-term challenge and a long-term upward trend, fueled by alignment of really long-term consumer trend, a sound strategy and I'll add a talented and engaged workforce. And that gives us a lot of confidence in our 2019.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes our question-and-answer session today.
