Good day and welcome to the Synaptics' Second Quarter Fiscal Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jennifer Jarman of the Blueshirt Group. Please go ahead.\nJennifer Jarman -- Co-Founder & Director\nThanks very much, Stephanie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today on Synaptics' Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. With me on today's call are Rick Bergman, President and CEO; Kermit Nolan newly named Interim CFO; and Wajid Ali, outgoing CFO as announced in this afternoon's press release. This call is also being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the company's website at synaptics.com.\nA quick reminder that we have posted a supplemental slide presentation on our Investor Relations website. The supplementary slides have also been furnished as an exhibit to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC earlier today and add additional color on our financial results. In addition to the company's GAAP results, management will also provide supplementary results on a non-GAAP basis which excludes share-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and certain other non-cash or recurring or non-recurring items. Please refer to the press release issued after market close today for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results.\nAdditionally, we would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, Synaptics will make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial conditions results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. Although Synaptics believes estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control and may prove to be inaccurate.\nSynaptics cautions that actual results may differ materially from any future performance suggested in the company's forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's current and periodic reports filed with the SEC including the Synaptics' Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Synaptics expressly disclaims any obligation to update this forward-looking information.\nAnd I'll now turn the call over to Rick Bergman. Rick?\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks Jennifer. And I'd like to welcome everyone to today's call. Synaptics posted another strong quarter and a positive first half of our fiscal 2019. Revenue was right on the mark within our guidance range and up 2% sequentially. I'm very, very pleased to report that we handedly exceeded our projections for non-GAAP EPS posting year-over-year growth of 40%. This was driven by our sixth consecutive quarter of improvement in non-GAAP gross margins which were up 300 basis points over the year ago period as we continue to inch closer toward our medium-term target of 40%.\nOur favorable operating performance provides further validation of the positive impact of the Synaptics 3.0 strategy on our company and our financial results. We have made a disciplined smart decisions as we transition into a more diverse company with decreasing reliance on mobile and shifting greater focus to IoT. This has allowed us to steadily improve our margins and amplify our earnings power, boosting our profitability profile and business model. As we enter the new calendar year, we believe the significance of this transition is even more evident in light of the current conditions affecting certain areas of our business.\nAs widely reported in mobile, a couple of leading OEMs have publicized significant softness in demand. Like others in the supply chain, Synaptics is not insulated from these trends. However, the value of our diverse customer base and strong position with several China OEMs that continue to post growth is helping to somewhat lessen the impact. We remain a clear leader in the field as we continue to deliver innovation that our customers highly value across or OLED DDIC, touch and TDDI. In IoT, we are excited to be sampling our next-generation AudioSmart solutions to key customers. This is the industry's first 22-nanometer purpose-built solution for the voice market providing low power cost efficiency and the ability for higher-level integration.\nAs previously noted, we are seeing near-term weakness in the broader consumer IoT market, however, the catalyst for growth remain very attractive and we continue to set ourselves up for a strong leadership and success across the multiple opportunities we are addressing with a growing pipeline of design wins.\nThe PC market is a bright spot for Synaptics, generating year-over-year growth and demonstrate sustained power of our investments and innovations even in mature markets where we have been operating for a long time. While we are not immune to component shortages across the industry, we are benefiting from increased content for PC through growing attach rates for our capacitive fingerprint solutions.\nLastly, we remain very well positioned in automotive where we will remain on a trajectory to double our revenue by 2021. Armed with the ability to better navigate downward market cycles under Synaptics 3.0, we remain very excited about the main growth drivers of our business including IoT OLED and automotive where we continue to invest to support our broad solutions platform and premium customer base. In addition, we are laser-focused on strong execution as we deliver our next generation of products which I will now discuss as we review recent progress across our four key markets.\nLet's begin with our IoT division. Synaptics power devices continue to proliferate in areas from smart speakers to set-top boxes and soundbars to voice-enabled car accessories and high-fidelity digital headset and high-end smartphones. In fact, it's now common to have multiple products powered by Synaptics in your home, office and car. Our new series of SmartEdge AudioSmart solutions leveraging 22 nanometers is now sampling at key customers and is expected to begin shipping in fiscal Q4. These include the world's first fully integrated SoCs comprising their own network acceleration, our proprietary wake word engine are highly advanced far-field voice processing.\nTargeting a broad variety of voice-enabled smart home devices including hubs, Wi-Fi repeaters, speakers and appliances, the AudioSmart AS3xx product family incorporates a new powerful machine learning engine. Ensuring a high-level of device and system security is a fundamental differentiator of this new set of products, this ranges from a dedicated security processor to architecting every element of the SoC in system implementation. The AS371 solution with SyNAP on-device intelligence, it enhances consumer privacy by greatly reducing the need to continuously send personal data to the cloud. Voice is rapidly becoming the preferred interface for interacting with devices.\nRecently at CES, two of our product partners launched the first car accessories with Google Assistant in our far-field-voice solution, the JBL LINK Drive and the Anker Roav Bolt.\nAnother success in the IoT space includes a selection of our VideoSmart and AudioSmart technologies by SK broadband in Korea for its upcoming B TV consumer devices to be launched in 2019. This partnership is expected to power next-generation services to 4 million subscribers.\nSynaptics' VideoSmart technologies have a leading market position in the fastest growing segment in the IPTV OTT industry where service providers have adopted Android as a software platform. Industry analyst report that over 70% of TV operators worldwide are considering Android and that there will be over 100 million devices shipped by calendar year 2022 with Android TV. In addition to the latest 4K HDR video in security technologies, our VideoSmart family has added AI to its differentiating feature set. Our AudioSmart far-field voice DSB technologies are also being adopted by TV providers for enabling consumers to use their voice to control their TV in home automation services.\nNow let's turn to our Mobile division. Our strategic investments in timing of product roll-outs and smartphone displays are really paying off as the TDDI market continues to grow rapidly and as broader OLED capacity begins to materialize. Our ClearView OLED display driver leveraging flexible chip-on-film packaging or COF has been widely adopted by several major smartphone OEMs.\nAs we move into the next generation of solutions, we believe that we are now sampling the industry's lowest power OLED DDIC which consumes 40% less power than the prior version. Synaptics continues to lead the evolution toward basel-free and brilliantly immersive Infinity displays for both OLED and LCD smartphones with our innovative COF designs highlighted by over 20 projects already in mass production including the world's largest OEMs.\nOur close partnership with key display manufacturers in China, Japan and Korea are arming global smartphone OEMs with state-of-the-art touch and display technology across all resolutions, whether OLED or LCD panels. We have built a mature COF supply chain to address the rapid trend toward basel-free phones in our early innovations in TouchView TDDI and discrete DDICs are enabling the market to flourish with vivid smartphone displays showcasing our feature-rich technology.\nSome of the latest adopters of Synaptics TDDI include Huawei, who selected our TouchView technology for multiple models including the P20, the Honor 8 and 10 Lite, as well as five other models. In addition Oppo chose our TDDI for its new F5 and Vivo for its new V9 models.\nSynaptics leadership in OLED has also led to several discrete touch wins including two new models from Oppo and three new Vivo phones. Our VR portfolio was also gaining traction with our R63 455 DDIC being selected for the latest Qualcomm reference headset design. The 2K resolution of our solution helps eliminate the screen door effect and enables higher resolution content to be sent over existing data protocols like USB Type-C.\nNow let's move to another key growth area, automotive, where the connected car is driving market trends toward more and larger displays. In the prior quarter, we talked about several display manufacturers building full in-sell automotive panels using Synaptics TDDI solution.\nI'm pleased to say that we are now seeing those efforts transform into design-ins across Japan, Europe, China and the U.S. demonstrating wide adoption of the technology and industry recognition of Synaptics' strength in display and touch integration.\nWe had several automotive TDDI display panels at CES this year which were well received by OEMs and Tier 1s, and likewise, Synaptics solutions were also displayed by multiple OEMs in their booths. In addition, we laid out the first OEM production panel using Synaptics TDDI this month. We expect cars with Synaptics TDDI technology to roll-out off assembly lines toward the end of calendar year 2020.\nNow let's turn to our PC division, where our strong TouchPad business continues to command market share leadership and our PC fingerprint business is strong and growing. In fact our newest Match-in-Sensor fingerprint solution will be shipping in leading PC OEMs products starting this quarter. Our footprint in PC also includes Skype-certified audio codecs and display interface technologies. Our leadership in these areas, along with key partnerships with leaders such as Microsoft, AMD, Intel and standards such as FIDO continue to define the road maps of PC OEMs globally.\nIn the quarter, we announced Clevo, a leading OEM/ODM notebook manufacturer for a variety of global consumer brands is featuring Synaptics state-of-the-art secure pad gamma technology for several of its new high-performance notebook series.\nIn industry first, the Cleva secure pad gamma integration merges Synaptics newest glass-based TouchPad technology with our new cutting-edge OXi-based Clear ID optical fingerprint sensor into a single module for notebook PCs. We are glad to be able to demo one of these models at CES.\nYou may recall in 2016, we announced an exclusive partnership with Oxi Technology, a Shanghai-based developer of unique and patented optical fingerprint technology. The collaboration includes combining technology from each company into development of new proprietary optical sensing solutions. And we are pleased to see this starting to accumulate in innovative new user interfaces.\nBefore we move to discussing of financials, I'd like to address the CFO transition announced today as Wajid has decided to pursue an executive level opportunity at another publicly held company. On behalf of the Board, I'd like to thank him for his numerous contributions to Synaptics over the last several years and we wish him well with his next venture. We're pleased to announce that our longtime VP of Finance and Corporate Controller, Kermit Nolan, who's been with the company for nearly 15 years, has been promoted to Corporate VP, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim CFO. We've also begun a search for a new CFO.\nWith that, I'd like to give Wajid an opportunity to say a few words.\nWajid Ali -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Rick. This is a very bitter sweet transition as I've made a personal decision to pursue an opportunity that makes a lot of sense for me from a professional development standpoint. It's been quite a privilege to work with Synaptics these past four years along with such a talented executive team. And I'm truly thankful to play the role in the company's transformation and expanded growth and profit potential. Having worked very closely with Kermit, during my tenure here, I have the utmost faith in his abilities as interim CFO. And it's my pleasure to now introduce him to walk you through the Q2 financial results and outlook.\nKermit Nolan -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Wajid, for your support and confidence, and hello, everyone.\nSynaptics posted solid second quarter results with revenues of $425.5 million at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 2% sequentially. As reflected in the presentation materials that we released in advance of this call, revenue from Mobile, IoT and PC products was approximately 65%, 20% and 15% respectively. Revenue from mobile products was up 5% compared with the year-ago quarter, and up 4% sequentially. Revenue from IoT products was down 18% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially.\nAs we discussed last quarter, we've shifted a large portion of our investment dollars from in-display fingerprint to IoT to enable stronger growth of IoT over the midterm which, we believe, will become more evident toward the end of the fiscal year. Revenue from PC products was up 4% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. During the quarter, we had two customers above 10% of revenue at 14% and 20%.\nFor the December quarter, our GAAP gross margin was 35.2% which includes $15.1 million in intangible asset amortization and $800,000 of share-based compensation cost. GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter were $124.8 million, which includes share-based compensation of $15.4 million, acquisition-related costs of $3.3 million consisting primarily of intangibles amortization and some transitory compensation program costs, and restructuring expenses of $2.1 million.\nOur GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 36.2%. In the December quarter, we had GAAP net income of $12.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our December quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 38.9% was near the high end of our guidance range and primarily reflects overall product mix. December quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $104 million, which was below the low end of our guidance range. For the second quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 12%. Non-GAAP net income for the December quarter was $54.4 million or $1.55 per diluted share, 42% year-over-year -- increase of 42% year-over-year compared with $38.2 million or $1.11 per diluted share in the December quarter of last fiscal year.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $283 million of cash, an increase of $20 million from the preceding quarter which reflects approximately $59 million of cash flow from operations, net of $38 million used to repurchase approximately 988,000 shares during the quarter. We expect to continue to be active on an opportunistic basis with regard to our stock repurchase program. Receivables at the end of December were $326 million and DSOs were 69 days, reflecting a back-end loaded quarter. Inventories were 146 million and inventory turns were 7.1. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.4 million and depreciation was $9.2 million.\nNow, I will make a few comments regarding our quarterly outlook which reflects the broader market factors that Rick mentioned earlier. Based on our backlog of approximately $255 million entering the March quarter, subsequent bookings, customer forecast, products sell-in and sell-through timing patterns, as well as expected product mix, we anticipate revenue for the March quarter to be in the range of $340 million to $380 million. We expect the revenue mix from mobile, IoT and PC products to be approximately 62%, 20% and 18% respectively.\nI will now provide GAAP outlook data for our March quarter and we'll ill follow with the non-GAAP outlook data. We anticipate the stock-based compensation charge in the third quarter to be in the range of $16.5 million to $17.5 million. In addition, March quarter GAAP expenses will include non-cash charges of approximately $18 million related to intangibles amortization, of which approximately $15 million will be reflected in cost of sales. Finally, we expect our GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be in the range of 25% to 30% for the fiscal year.\nI will now provide non-GAAP outlook data for our March quarter. Taking into account our overall revenue mix, we expect non-GAAP gross margin in the March quarter to be between 38% and 39%. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter to be in the range of $102 million to $106 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP long-term tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be in the range of 11% to 13%. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the March quarter is anticipated to be in the range of $0.70 to $1 per share.\nIn closing my comments, I'd like to point out that we continue to diversify our product mix with greater focus on maximizing profitability and we are operating within our short-term model for gross margins and operating profit as we look at the fiscal year. As you know, historically, the March quarter is our seasonally lowest period, with the back half of the calender year generally being much stronger. On quarterly patterns maybe more volatile due to the -- due to global economic factors. We continue to focus on our short-term model with an eye toward the midterm.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call back to Rick.\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks Kermit. While we can't control the broader market conditions, we continue to march forward with our disciplined strategy and targeted investments under Synaptics 3.0., which has better equipped us to weather gyrations in our markets by expanding our product portfolio and diversifying our customer base, while pressing ahead and voice in other growth areas of the business.\nUltimately, we are investing to win. As shown at CES, Synaptics is number one in numerous key areas across our technology portfolio and we intend to expand our share. We are well positioned for leadership in IoT with solutions based on vertically integrated software, firmware and hardware and as a strategic supplier to key market leaders.\nWe continue to innovate and lead in the mobile market with strong growth opportunities across LCD, TDDI and OLED display and touch. We are forging a strong growth path in automotive where we are leading a transition to TDDI and expect to benefit as a connected car drives a revolution in the need for displays. Lastly, we continue to innovate in the PC market where we remain a leader in touch and are capitalizing on additional growth opportunities through fingerprint as well as voice and audio solutions.\nOur investments are focused on driving technology and product leadership in high-growth markets as well as rapidly increasing our dollar content per box. By carefully developing our product road map, we are successfully executing to our financial targets with expanding margins and profitability.\nWith that, we'll now turn the call over to the operator to start the Q&A session. Operator?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel.\nKevin Cassidy -- Stifel -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the good results, and good luck, Wajid. On the -- maybe you had mentioned it slightly, I don't know what kind of a snapback we would see in the coming quarters. Can you give us an idea what are channel inventory is like and maybe even the situation on TDDI wafers?\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Kevin. So I think as you discussed in the past for the majority of our business, the idea of a channel isn't a huge concept. We certainly, for our new IoT business is where the smaller companies start to play a bigger and bigger role for us.\nBut for our mobile customers, we kind of manage at -- indirectly have some of that effect with the display manufacturers. But for the most part, we're comfortable and we've accounted for any of that certainly in the guidance that we have. And as we march forward certainly there's additional opportunity and that kind of leads us into your second question which is TDDI. There the -- any inventory is very, very lean.\nSo we have now -- at this point, I can say, supply is meeting demand. We believe we have adequate support from several of our sources to meet the demand out there and it's somewhat unfortunate though, because we had to pass on a few opportunities last fall that we would otherwise be rolling with if we had the wafer supply. But at this juncture, we're ready to continue forward and grow that business.\nKevin Cassidy -- Stifel -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And maybe just gross margin seems to be holding up very well even in the -- with weakness. Is that IoT driving that and is there a room for gross margin expansion still?\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Kevin, if I put out there, the goal for the company is to get to 40% and we're going to have to work at it. And it's -- we have six in a row and we're not committing that, we'll continue to we hit that going up every quarter, because ultimately, we're focused on increasing earnings per share. As you can tell just from the percentages, IoT isn't the number one reason anymore that our gross margin is going up. It's -- I would say it's two things. Our product mix has been somewhat favorable across all three businesses. And then the second factor is just the incredible focus that we have internally on that and recognizing the need that we want to continue to have gross margins go up across the company.\nKevin Cassidy -- Stifel -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Congratulations again. Thanks.\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) We'll move on to Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities USA LLC -- Analyst\nYeah, I guess, a good quarter and guide here. And best of luck, Wajid. Just on the inventory side, I was wondering if you can give us a little more color on how inventory is (Technical Difficulty).\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nVijay thanks for the question, but we kind of heard the first part. You said inventory and the line broke up quite a bit. Could you repeat it please?\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities USA LLC -- Analyst\nWhich inventory is in the channel of distributors?\nKermit Nolan -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer\nInventory in the channel at distributors.\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIf you're asking about if we have inventory in the channel or at distributors. Someone answer that question for Kevin. Like a lot of our -- we aren't like a lot of our semiconductor peers that have the large international distributors. We run pretty lean with the exception of our IoT business which for a portion of that business with the smaller customers, we do stock inventory. Now we do have somewhat of a channel through the display manufacturers, but as an example, with TDDI right now is very lean because of our ability to meet the market demand through the winner. So overall, the general channel or inventory that we've already sold so to speak is fairly lean for Synaptics.\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities USA LLC -- Analyst\nGot it. And just on the gross margin side, obviously (inaudible) to be, you guys are executing well. As you look at 2019, how do you, see the gross margin plays out through the rest of the year?\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I'll start and then if Kermit wants to add some comments as well. A lot of it's still, as I said, comes down to mix. And so as we kind of look out through the calendar year, you start to see seasonality. And we have big hopes for our IoT business and that tends to be a second half of the calendar year business. So we'll continue to work the gross margins. You saw our guidance for this quarter. And as I mentioned on Kevin's question, from a focus perspective, the company will do our best to continue to inch it up as we move forward.\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities USA LLC -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) And it looks like we have a question from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel.\nKevin Cassidy -- Stifel -- Analyst\nHi. Yeah, thanks for taking my follow-up. Just on the OpEx, it looks like it was very good control. Can we expect that going forward or are there some one-time changes there?\nKermit Nolan -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer\nI think, again, we've taken actions over the last 2.5 years to bring our OpEx in line with our revenues. We are definitely anticipating this quarter to be in that range of 102 to 106. I'd like to think that we will maintain that. Obviously there's also investment into IoT, but my expectation is we will keep the OpEx down in the 102 to 106 range, hopefully this quarter and next quarter for sure.\nKevin Cassidy -- Stifel -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And maybe as a follow-up, Rick, you mentioned the 22-nanometer devices. Does that give you a cost advantage also or is the -- maybe more (inaudible) network out as well as for just driving cost, but maybe more for performance?\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. We -- Kevin, we recognize we're in consumer devices which there's always cost pressure on those type of devices. So when we made that selection, we really felt 22-nanometer was a sweet spot, especially the global foundries process which is an SOA -- SOI type of process which gives better performance power than some of the other CMOS technologies out there. But also, because it's not quite in the 12 or 14 nanometer node where you talk some pretty darn expensive wafers and mass costs and so forth, we really felt it gave us a notch up from what was 28-nanometer, the right cost point and then the right power performance ratio as well as the ability to continue to integrate.\nOperator\nUp next is Ari Shusterman from Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nAri Shusterman -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\nHello, this is Ari, I'm taking this question from -- for Rajiv Gill, Needham and Company. So within consumer IoT for auto, who are your key partners right now and what new partners are you trying to attract to your platform? And same goes for consumer IoT for SmartHome.\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo our key partner is in -- let me start with automotive. As you can imagine, it's bit of a combination. We really have to meet with three different entities. One is the classic-branded OEMs. And until some of these products are announced, I can't really go into who they are. But they want to understand and it's so important to them now with the connected car about where display technology is at, we meet with them. In some cases, they'll use a Tier 1 or in other cases, they'll go directly to a display manufacturer and the display manufacturers are starting to look more and more like Tier 1s. We have to work with those Tier 1s or display manufacturers to get our product designed in.\nAnd you can imagine who the display manufacturers are in the world out there. It's all the names you know, whether it's Samsung, LGD, BOE, AUO, et cetera that participate in the automobile market. As we shift to IoT, it's a much more fragmented ecosystem. And we work with all of the key ecosystem players. Of course Google is a big customer, but we've been a strong support of their initiatives around Android and what they've done just globally, whether it's smartphones or anything. We also of course work with Amazon as one of their certified partners on voice. And many of the Amazon third-party solutions are based on our technology that you see available out there.\nWhen you move into the -- to Chinese, Baidu, Tencent to Alibaba who we also work with, work for similar reasons. If with IoT, then you shift into -- there's also the server provider market. So you're asking kind of a broad question, I guess, in someways we did a presentation at CES and we list many of those partners and customers in that presentation if you go out to our Investor Relations website. But the server provider platforms are all the providers out there worldwide. So it's a quite worldwide audience, Bouygues Telecom, we mentioned SK Broadband on this particular call. So that's smattering of the partners that we work with in those two spaces.\nAri Shusterman -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you for your answer. And then just one quick follow-up. When it comes to OLED, can you give a little bit more color and some updates on the road map?\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAs much as that's publicly available. So today we have a QHD solution for OLED as well as a full HD. And those could be used either with flexible or rigid OLED panels. We printed very strongly in the script that we've done a power -- a lower power version of those devices which has now begun sampling in the marketplace. And then beyond that, you can expect us to continue to innovate around display quality, power and higher levels of integration.\nOperator\nAnd next we have Charlie Anderson from Dougherty & Company.\nCharlie Lowell Anderson -- Dougherty & Company LLC -- Analyst\nYeah, thanks for taking my questions. I'm hopping between calls here, so sorry if some of this has been asked. Just on the IoT, it looks like where you're guiding to in the march quarter will be down maybe 19% or so after down 18% or so in December if my math is right. So I guess I'm just curious what you see as potentially turning that around? I know your -- bunch of new products specifically within IoT. And then as it turns around, I'm kind of curious how the margin profile changes. I know the Marvell business you bought and the Conexant business you bought had very different gross margins. So in terms of -- when you do see that growing is a margin, is that helpful on the gross margin? And then I've got a follow-up.\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Thanks, Charlie. So, in some ways, I think we should to why is our Q3 guidance down year-over-year. Two kind of reasons there and that's persisted from what we said about Q2, so kind of no new there, is that a lot of our business was in the smart speaker business and it just had a fantastic year kind of as that came out of the shoot there, and so that weakness is persisting into Q3. That's kind of one factor. And then the other factor is just more broadly the whole IoT market is slower. As you've heard I'm sure the last few weeks, those two factors kind of had the lower year-over-year growth. We kind of expected to kind of grow from here.\nAs I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we will be in mass production with our 22-nanometer products and our fiscal Q4, and that certainly gives us a nice boost, they tend to be a littler higher ASP products. And then as we swing into more seasonality in the back half of the year, I think the year-on-year compares will be much more favorable. And so we certainly expect that business to grow going forward. In terms of gross margin, Charlie, you're right. Conexant gross margins were a bit higher, the Marvell margins were a bit lower than 50%. We kind of balanced out a bit above 50% gross margin. That's where we expect our IoT business to continue to operate going forward.\nCharlie Lowell Anderson -- Dougherty & Company LLC -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And then Rick, just sort of big picture question. You have exposure on the LCD side and then also exposure on the OLED side. I'm curious just as sort of the consumer taste shift and sort of what you're seeing real-time in terms of what people are after? Has anything changed in your view of what you need to invest in from a LCD versus OLED perspective internally? Thanks.\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. So, again as I mentioned to a previous caller, we actually have our best look at the trends between the two in terms of percent of the marketplace in the Investor Relations site with the presentation we did at CES where we showed OLED. Non-Korean (inaudible) being a little less than 100 million displays this year, so nothing to change out over the past month. So we're really excited about the OLED ramp and we think it will continue to be a higher and higher percentage of the smartphone marketplace. Kind of balancing that though of course I think consumers are speaking in terms of price points that they want for their phones.\nAnd LCD continues to have a substantial cost advantage versus OLED displays at least for the next couple of years. So we're kind of sticking with that mix going forward. As you can imagine, we are shifting more of our investment dollars to OLED, because there's higher growth rates there. Well, we also want to maintain our share and position in the LCD market.\nCharlie Lowell Anderson -- Dougherty & Company LLC -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Thanks so much.\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd, I guess, I should add there Charlie as well, that's independent of automotive where we certainly are picking up our investment in automotive will be -- vast majority of that will be LCD for the next decade.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) We will move on to Brett Simpson of Arete Research.\nBrett Simpson -- Arete Research Services LLP -- Analyst\nYeah, thanks very much. Rick, I just had a follow-up on the mobile business. I don't know if could give us a sense for how do you see TDDI as a market opportunity this year? Do you think in calendar '19, TDDI will grow. Just bearing in mind there is a transition to OLED under way? And then just on the OLED side, can you give us a sense for what proportion of your mobile business is OLED today or help us sort of size this and how you think the ramp will play out? It's helpful knowing that you're seeing non-Korean OLED at like 100 million units this year. But any market share projections or anything you can help us just to sort figure out where you're positioned and how you think it plays out over the course of calendar 2019, that would be very helpful?\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Let me see if I can address each of those questions.\nOn the TDDI side, clearly the market will be bigger in 2019 than 2018. Now one of the challenges of course we have is we have a pretty good share in 2018. And so our goal is to maintain that share as best we can. And it won't be a huge growth driver for us, but we still see the opportunity in the calendar 2019 to grow that business year-over-year. There is -- just -- today, most of the TDDI market is in the full HD segment. The HD segment for example is still a mix of a discrete type of solutions, but that's going to change very quickly as everybody is getting the benefits of TDDI finally.\nSo a pretty rapid shift. That's in the presentation that I mentioned as well our view on what percent of the market and what opportunity we have in TDDI. On OLED there is -- I have to remind myself, there is a couple of pieces to OLED. One is the display drivers which I tend to talk most about. And it's -- the business as part of the company is -- sorry I'm doing some quick math here. It's still relatively small thinking the 5 percentage area of our quarterly results, maybe even a little bit lower than that. As we move forward of course we expect that to be higher, that -- the 5% with the display driver comment.\nOf course we sell touch controllers and there we participate much more broadly in the OLED markets. And the -- I mentioned three design wins that we had with Oppo and Vivo. And those are all with Samsung display as an example. That business is even bigger than the kind of the 5% category that I talked about. So we're a fairly reasonable size participant in the OLED market today.\nBrett Simpson -- Arete Research Services LLP -- Analyst\nGreat. And Rick, just to follow-up on that. As you look at the sort of the year playing out for OLED in the calendar '19, how do you see that non-Korean display, that OLED opportunity, the 100 million unit market that you described. How do you think your market share plays out, and can you give us a sense as to how that business evolves as we go through the year?\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt will ramp through the year of course as these various suppliers are bringing on capacity. So I don't know if I can give you a Q1 is this and Q4 is that type of number. I will say it is a bit less than 100 million units as best as we can tell. And our market share, again it's really hard to for me to peg down on particular product line, especially when we're in the early stages. But it's kind of historically in the small display market, we've been in the 30-ish percent market share.\nBrett Simpson -- Arete Research Services LLP -- Analyst\nRight. Thanks very much. That's helpful. Cheers. (Multiple Speakers)\nOperator\nIt looks that there are no further -- sorry, it looks that there no further questions. (Operator Instructions) And I apologize. Would you mind clarifying that last answer? I apologize, I interrupted.\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSorry, Emily. I just wanted to make it clear, it is part of our Sam or the non-Korean OLED display manufacturers.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) And there are no further questions. I'd like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks.\nRick Bergman -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We look forward to seeing some of you again soon at Mobile World Congress in the latter part of the month. Goodbye.\nOperator\nAnd this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.
