Please go ahead.\nYi Wang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Chuhan. Thank you for joining our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. 2018 was a milestone year for us as we successfully completed our IPO on the renowned New York Stock Exchange on September 27th, 2018. We believe the cash proceed and additive brand recognition generated from the IPO will deliver meaningful value for our business in the years to come.\nWe are pleased to report another strong quarter that capped off a solid year. Fourth quarter net revenues increased by approximately 195% year-over-year to RMB224.5 million. Full year 2018 net revenues and gross billing grew by approximately 285% and 215% respectively compared with the prior year. Such outstanding performance was driven by the continued robust growth of our overall business and the user base expansion. Our cutting edge technologies, big data, and well-established education pedagogies underpinned our growth strategy.\nÂ In 2018, our formative feedback system was awarded first place in the spoken Computer-Assisted Language Learning challenge, jointly organized by the University of Geneva, the University of Birmingham, Radboud University, and the University of Cambridge, demonstrating the leadership that we have in applying AI to language learning.\nOver the course of the full year 2018, our flagship app, English Liulishuo experienced solid expansion powered by our AI teacher that provides personalized teaching and guidance for all core components of a user's language learning process. Furthermore, our AI teacher continuously evolves and delivers more personally tailored learning programs while leveraging our massive volume of labeled user data. As of December 31st, 2018, we had recorded approximately 26.3 billion sentences and 2.0 billion minutes of conversations covering a broad range of geographic distribution and proficiency levels.\nAs a pioneer in the AI-powered English learning market, we are benefiting from the growing trend of education upgrades in China. We're pleased to see that our advanced platform with industry-leading courses and services have appealed to a broader student population with a total of 110.3 million registered users as of December 31st, 2018 compared with 61.3 million as of December 31st, 2017. Our premium bundle is pivotal to our strategy to expand our user base and drive user conversion. The rich content and the interactive features within the free courses increase use engagement and retention while the paid AI-based systematic learning solutions helped convert active users to paying customers.\nA recent study by the Centre of Research in English Language Learning and Assessment at the University of Bedfordshire showed that after approximately two months of studying and using English Liulishuo, users English learning proficiency was significantly improved, benefiting by the higher learning efficacy of our product. The total number of paying users who purchased the courses and services on our platform grew more then three-fold to 2.5 million in 2018 compared with 815,700 in 2017.\nThe progress we made in 2018 laid a strong foundation for us, and we expect to continue the successful momentum while further expanding our user base, enhancing use engagement, and improving the learning experience through the application of new technologies, content, products, and features.\nMoreover, given the high scalability and the versatile nature of our business model, we see tremendous opportunities to expand our adjustable markets in English learning and beyond. First, we have already expanded offerings within the English learning vertical to test preparation with our IELTS Liulishuo app added to the enterprise market with our enterprise learning services. Second, we are also working on tailoring our AI-powered English learning products to target younger demographics, including K-12 students. Third, while our footprint has so far mainly been in China, we are constantly looking for ways to increase our global presence. And lastly, our AI technologies can be used in non-English languages or even for non-English learning, presenting us with huge growth potential in the long run. Notably, our speech recognition engine already supports six other languages besides English.\nAs we start another year with excitement and optimism, we believe our dedication to advancing our proprietary AI technologies, providing innovative and differentiated products, and creating superior personalized learning experiences that result in higher user engagement learning efficiency and efficacy is what sets us apart and allows us to succeed in the long run. While we have a long way to go, as we are in the early stages of AI-powered education 3.0, we remain committed to our mission of empowering everyone to realize their full potential.\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Miss Bin Yu, who will discuss our key financial results.\nBin Yu -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Yi, and hello, everyone. We made significant strides in 2018 to position our company for long-term sustainable growth. Our strong financial performance, in particular our robust topline growth, was a clear indication of our compelling scalable model and our strong competitive position. As we are building our brand awareness and driving our user base, our sales and marketing expenses increased in terms of absolute dollars in 2018. This is within our expectations, and at the same time, we are striving to optimize the return on our marketing investments. Due to our scalable business model and high revenue growth, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined to 111% in 2018 from 171% in 2017. Let us now begin by looking at our key financial matrix in the fourth quarter. In the interest of time, I will speak to the highlights of our results. Rather than a line-by-line review, I'd encourage listeners to refer to our earnings release for more details.\nNet revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 were RMB224.5 million, or $32.6 million, a 195% increase from RMB76.1 million for the same quarter last year.

The increase was primarily due to the increase in, 1.) Salaries and benefits for certain full-time employees, 2.) IT service cost, and 3.) Service fees paid to contract human teachers for our premium service, with all such cost resulting from the company's general business growth and user base expansion.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was RMB152.8 million, or $22.2 million, a 181% increase from RMB54.4 million for the same quarter last year.

The increase was primarily due to higher branding and marketing expenses and salaries and benefits for sales and marketing personnel, including our online study advisors.

We expect to see similarity in the first quarter due to the January 1st and Chinese New Year holidays. This forecast reflects the company's current and preliminary review on the current business situation and market conditions, which is subject to change.\n...\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to questions. As a reminder, Mr. Zheren Ben Hu, our CTO and Co-founder, and Mr. Hui Lin, our Chief Scientist and Co-founder, are joining us for the Q&A session. Operator, please go ahead.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nLaix Inc (LAIX) Q1 2019 Earnings Call Transcript\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nCertainly. To ask a question, please press *1 on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press #. For the benefit of all participants on today's call, if you wish to ask your question to management in Chinese, please immediately repeat your question in English.\nYour first question comes from the line of Timothy Zhao with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nTimothy Zhao -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nHi, management. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter and a great year. I have two questions. The first question is on the gross margin. I see the gross margin for this quarter was around 68%. It's a bit lower than the previous quarters. Would you elaborate more on the drivers behind that and how we should expect going forward? And second question is on the user acquisition cost or the sales and marketing cost per paying user. I see it as being quite stable in the past few quarters, so what do you think the trend as move into 2019? Thank you.\nBin Yu -- Chief Financial Officer\nI will take this question. This is Bin Yu, CFO of the company. For your first question, the reason why the gross margin declined slightly was due to the VIP service we introduced for last quarter of 2018. We offered a RMB3,000 SKU for one year. In this small class SKU, we have some human teachers to help the students, so we booked the costs, the salaries and benefits paid to this human teachers in the cost of goods sold, which drives down the gross margin slightly.\nFor the second quarter, for the cost of user acquisition, as you state, we do have a quite stable trend. We have applied an integrated strategy to monitor our CAC, and we believe our rich content, different product mix, and the increased brand awareness will help us to attract more organic traffic which will lower our CAC budget. Overall, we've been able to maintain a stable CAC despite the traffic's getting more and more expensive across different channels. I hope this will help to answer your questions.\nTimothy Zhao -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nSure, thank you. Thank you, Bin.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Sheng Zhong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSheng Zhong -- Morgan Stanley -- Equity Analyst\nThank you for taking my question. So, the first question is can you give us some breakdown of your paying user? It's grow very fast in this quarter, so want to know how many of them are the first-time user and how many of them are the repurchase ones and the average lifetime using your course, the average usage time. And secondly is a follow-up on the gross margin. What's your outlook of the gross margin trend? And since you mentioned that this is mainly because of the VIP costs, so how much percent of the VIP cost in terms of your revenue? And the last one is Yi talked about a long-term strategy. That is very helpful, so can you please give some more timeline of the strategy? Thank you.\nZheren Ben Hu -- Director and Chief Technology Officer\nThis is Zheren Ben Hu. I will take the first question about user breakdown. Bin and Yi mentioned in the previous section of the paying customer had increased from 815,700 for the full year of 2017 to 2.5 million for the full year of 2018. The growth itself is tremendous, and at this moment, we do not close the very clear breakdown about first-time user and then the repeated paying users at this moment.\nBin Yu -- Chief Financial Officer\nThis is Bin. I will take the gross margin outlook. For the gross margin, as I mentioned earlier, the decline from previous quarter is mainly due to the introduction of a new, higher-priced SKU, the RMB3,000 SKU for one-year class. And because this is a new product, so we're still trying to improve the efficiency of the product by improving the OSE management procedures. But looking forward, the gross margin will be driven by different product mix, and we believe with our AI model, we'll be able to maintain a higher gross margin than the normal industry gross margin benchmark.\nYi Wang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\nThis is Yi Wang. I will answer the growth strategy question. As I mentioned before, we have a long-term commitment and excitement on this AI-plus education approach in general. As some of you guys may know, at the end of last year, we launched a new product, a new app, a new product line called Shaoer Liulishuo in Chinese, or Kid's Liulishuo. It has hit the market, and the initial user feedback on the product use has been pretty positive. Obviously, it's in the very early stages. We have several other products or SKUs in the pipeline, both in adult English learning market and in the kids. We remain dedicated to the growth of the user base for our flagship product English Liulishuo and AI-powered paid-course DongNi English. And notably, our Liuli reading product in adult English learning sector has also been growing very rapidly. We continue to be committed and on the lookout for different opportunities to penetrate into different markets including different demographic user groups and the geographic locations. We will update the market when we have solid developments that we wanna share with you. Thank you.\nSheng Zhong -- Morgan Stanley -- Equity Analyst\nThank you, management.\nOperator\nAgain, if you'd like to ask a question, please press *1 on your telephone keypad.\nYour next question comes from the line of Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChristine Cho -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nHi. Thank you and congrats on a great quarter. I just had a really quick follow-up question on the kid's program that you've just launched. Can you just give us a little bit more detail around pricing, target, and also competitive differentiation versus a lot of the other offerings? And also on how you keep the kids engaged because, obviously, it's a harder group to keep focused? So, any color around that would be great. Thank you.\nYi Wang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\nHi, this is Yi again. Thank you for the question. Obviously, the kid's market is a very exciting and huge market for us. We are not the first player in the market, obviously, but we feel excited to be coming in with all the expertise that we have accumulated over the years in the AI English teacher approach that we have pioneered in the market.\nRight now, there is only one course that users can buy within the free-to-download app, Kid's Liulishuo, which is a phonics course. It's a year-long course that teaches kids between the age 3-8 with all the basic concepts of phonics, and also, after completing the full-year course, the kid will master over 700 words and be able to have a solid foundation for pronunciation. So, right now, the course is priced at RMB998 for the whole year. That's the regular price. And right now, we have an introductory price of RMB9.9 for the first seven-day period for the users to get a taste. Obviously, we may adjust the price as needed, but that's right now the two price points that we can disclose.\nAnd in terms of differentiators, it's very clear that our approach is different from a lot of the other players in the market because we don't offer in-person online tutoring service taught by a human teacher. We took this AI teacher approach, and we think it's gonna be benefiting a lot for the younger age groups and their parents in terms of flexibility, convenience, efficacy, efficiency, and affordability, so we are very excited about this new market opportunity.\nChristine Cho -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nAs there are no further questions, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks.\nChuhan Wang -- Head of Strategy and Growth, Investor Relations\nThank you once again for joining us. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact LAIX investor relations through the contact information provided on our website or TPG investor relations.\n...\nOperator\nThis concludes this conference call.
