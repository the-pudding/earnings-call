At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Brad Burke, Investor Relations for CBRE. Thank you. You may begin.Brad Burke -- Investor RelationsThank you and welcome to CBRE's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Earlier today we issued a press release announcing our financial results and it is posted on our website CBRE.com. On the Investor Relations page of our website, you will find a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks. This presentation contains forward-looking statements. These include statements regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, foreign currency impact, and financial performance expectations. These statements should be considered estimates only and actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to our first quarter 2019 earnings report furnished on Form 8-K and our most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. During our remarks, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulations. Where required by these regulations, we have provided reconciliations to what we believe are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations together with explanations of these measures can be found within the appendix of this presentation. Additionally, all revenue and fee revenue growth rate percentages cited in our remarks are in local currency, unless otherwise stated.Please turn to slide three. Participating on our call today are Bob Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Groch, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer. Now please turn to slide four, as I turn the call over to Bob.Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Brad. And good morning everyone. CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our three business segments drove increases of 29% in adjusted EBITDA and 46% in adjusted EPS. The organizational changes we announced last year are improving our lines of business and helping to make us a more efficient client-focused company. For example, our two real estate services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions realized a combined 190 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins from last year's first quarter.Revenue growth was paced by another outstanding quarter for leasing, which increased by 22%. Leasing continues to benefit from both solid market fundamentals and market share gains. These gains are being driven by an offering for both one-off transactions and account-based clients that is increasingly differentiated within our industry. Leasing growth is also supported by strong recruiting. We are able to attract talented producers who tell us they can achieve more at CBRE than they can anywhere else. This speaks to the strength and differentiation of the CBRE platform.Our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which serves large account based clients, again saw fee revenue increase by double digits in local currency.This business had an outstanding quarter for new account wins and our active pipeline has now more than doubled in size in the past two years. Finally, our Real Estate Investments segment had a strong quarter with excellent adjusted EBITDA growth from real estate development.While development results can vary quarter to quarter, the long-term performance of our business has been outstanding. Our new flexible space initiative Hana has signed its first two deals with property owners and has a very active pipeline with additional property owner partnerships, expected to be announced in the near future.Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to thank Jim for his many accomplishments as our CFO. As we have discussed before, this will be Jim's last quarterly earnings call, as he focuses full time on his Chief Investment Officer responsibilities, where he will do great things for the company. We're excited to welcome Leah Stearns to CBRE as our next Chief Financial Officer. Leah will join us from American Tower Corporation next Wednesday. Leah is an outstanding leader with a strong financial and operational background and extensive international and commercial real estate experience. I know you will enjoy interacting with her as our new CFO. Now, Jim will take you through our results in greater detail.James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentThanks, Bob. I want to begin by welcoming Leah. She should be a great addition to our executive team and I look forward to working with her. Now, please turn to slide five. This is the first quarter where we are reporting results under our new business segments, and as a result, we are providing further incremental transparency into our performance. To help you with this transition, we have restated historical quarterly data, under our new segments back to the first quarter of 2017. We have also provided supplemental reports under our prior geographic reporting methodology, both are posted in Excel files on the Investor Relations section of our website.Turning to the quarter, as Bob noted, CBRE had a great start to 2019 with growth of 46% in adjusted EPS and 29% in adjusted EBITDA, almost all of which was organic. We appear to be on track for a 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions segments combined experienced 14% revenue growth, and 11% fee revenue growth, both in local currency; 22% adjusted EBITDA growth, in US dollars, and 190 basis point expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue.The increase in margins was driven by double-digit fee revenue growth, a favorable business mix and cost discipline. The net impact of a handful of choppier items such as mortgage servicing gains and fluctuations in currency, drove approximately one-fourth of this margin expansion in the quarter. We also had strong performance in our Real Estate Investments segment, with adjusted EBITDA increasing $37 million over the prior year. Within this segment, Investment Management benefited from co-investment gains and development benefited from several larger dispositions.GAAP earnings in the quarter were negatively affected by the non-cash writedown of intangibles in our Real Estate Securities' Investment Management business. As we have discussed previously, this business has been impacted by the industry wide shift in investor preferences to passive investment programs. The securities business now comprises less than 10% of AUM in our Investment Management business. Finally, Moody's recognized the strength of our balance sheet with an upgrade last week to be Baa1, in line with our BBB+ rating from S&P.Now, please turn to slide six, for a discussion of our Advisory Services segment. This segment includes our core services listed on the right hand side of the slide. For the quarter, this segment realized adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% in US dollars, despite the drag from lower property sales and fee revenue growth of 10%. Performance was led by our leasing business, which had another great quarter increasing globally by 22%, and growth was almost entirely organic. In the US, leasing was up 28% with strong demand from multiple sectors, including consumer products, energy and technology.We benefited from several large deals, outsized growth from account-based clients and ongoing recruiting gains. With growth in leasing revenues for the trailing-12 months, averaging over 20%, comparisons going forward will be more challenging. Loan servicing revenue grew 10% and our portfolio increased to a record $210 billion. Capital Markets revenue, which includes both property sales and commercial mortgage origination, declined by 1% globally, reflecting meaningful gains in market share.Within capital markets, commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 13%, fueled by robust activity with the US Government-Sponsored Enterprises as well as banks. Property sales revenue declined 5% against a challenging 11% growth comparison in the prior year, the comparisons become easier going forward. The decline in property sales reflects a tepid macro environment where marketwide sales volume decreased in all three global regions. Despite the softer quarter, we continue to take share in our property sales business. A modest 1% decline in US sales revenue, reflects significant market share gains, as estimated market volumes decreased 8%, according to Real Capital Analytics.Overall, Americas property sales declined 4% driven by Canada, which faced a 31% prior year growth comparison. International growth and sales was negatively impacted by weakness in our residential sales businesses in Australia and Singapore, which offset otherwise strong performance, particularly in Greater China and Japan. Adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue margin expansion of 200 basis points for the Advisory Services segment was driven by overall solid revenue growth, a favorable business mix and heightened focus on cost discipline.Now please turn to slide seven for a discussion of our Global Workplace Solutions segment, sometimes referred to as our outsourcing business. This segment achieved fee revenue growth of 12% in local currency and 8% in US dollars. All three regions posted double-digit growth in local currency, on top of strong double-digit growth in Q1 of the prior year. FX was particularly challenging headwind in the quarter, but should moderate as the year progresses.Global Workplace Solutions adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in US dollars, reflecting strong operating leverage. We started the year by winning several large new contracts, making it our strongest ever first quarter for new business wins. For example, we significantly expanded our relationship with Lowe's Home Improvement, by combining our traditional facilities management strengths with the FacilitySource technology and services capabilities that we acquired last year.FacilitySource had a small pilot program at Lowe's in place at the time of the acquisition. With this new contract, we now manage 196 million square feet for Lowe's nationally. We expect FacilitySource will continue to drive growth with clients that have large widely dispersed operations. With a record pipeline of pursuits, Global Workplace Solutions is off to an excellent start to 2019.Now please turn to slide eight for a discussion of our Real Estate Investments segment. This segment includes our investment management business, which includes contractual asset management fees, our development business and Hana, our flexible space solutions business. First quarter EBITDA growth of $37 million in this segment exceeded our own expectations. Investment management capital raising set a new record at $13 billion over the past 12 months. Assets under management increased by $1.7 billion in the quarter to reach a new high at more than $107 billion. Investment management contributed $6 million to adjusted EBITDA growth, co-investment returns totaled $13 million, driven by the strong rebound in public equity prices in Q1, more than offsetting the decline in carried interest revenue versus last year.The development business continues to exhibit excellent momentum, contributing $36 million to adjusted EBITDA growth, driven by several large asset sales, including an office disposition that had been budgeted for later in the year. In-process activity also reached a record level, totaling $9.7 billion at the end of Q1. As you know, EBITDA from our development business can be choppy from quarter-to-quarter. Last year, the second and third quarters generated the majority of our EBITDA. This year, we expect the bulk of our EBITDA from development to be generated in the first and fourth quarters.Finally, Hana incurred start-up costs in line with our expectations. In its early stages, Hana is being very well received, filling the marketplace need for property owners looking to participate in the powerful flexible space trend.Now, please turn to slide nine for Bob's closing remarks.Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Jim. CBRE is off to a great start in 2019. As we look ahead, our business has positive momentum and we are running ahead of the expectations we outlined at our Investor Day in March. The macro market drivers and our inherent competitive advantages remain intact. As always, we caution against reading too much into first quarter results, as this is our seasonally smallest period. We'll revisit our guidance once we see how the business performs through mid-year. With that operator, we'll open the line for questions.Questions and Answers:OperatorThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.Anthony Paolone -- JP Morgan -- AnalystOkay, thank you. Good morning. My first question is on GWS, your peer groups similarly talked about pretty high win rates in the first quarter. Can you give us a little bit more color on just the number of RFPs or the scope and how does that pipeline looks relative to how you thought about the year going into 2019?James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentYeah, sure Anthony, this is Jim. Well, I won't get specific on number of RFPs, but the magnitude of the pipeline has more than doubled where it was two years ago. So it's definitely in an all-time record. It's more than doubled where it was two years ago and the growth has just been very, very strong. So we had double-digit growth in all three regions, and that was on top of a very strong quarter, in the first quarter of last year, which had growth of 14% to 17% in local currency for the three regions.Anthony Paolone -- JP Morgan -- AnalystOkay. The RFPs that you're seeing are some of the larger projects, are they being divided among more than one service provider such that you can all have pretty high win rates and achieve your sort of growth goals or how is that playing out?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, Anthony this is Bob. There are a certain number of them, they get divided up, particularly the larger ones. But we've also prevailed in winning some very large accounts just ourselves. And I will tell you that the percentage of our pipeline that involves integrated multi-service comprehensive request for proposal has doubled relative to where it was a year ago. So, said differently, a year ago there may have been one or two services being requested. Now it's more typical that it will be all the services we offer, consulting, facilities management, project management, transaction management twice as often. And yes, sometimes they're split up, but often, we've been able to win a complete offering.Anthony Paolone -- JP Morgan -- AnalystOkay. And then just another question on GWS, now that you're rolling in some of the leasing activity related to that into that business line, has the leasing component of that or did the leasing component of that in the first quarter grow at an out-sized level? And does that piece of that business help with the overall margin, like you get the same kind of incremental margin on leasing in GWS as you do on the Advisory side?James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentWe're pretty conservative Anthony on how we're recognizing leasing revenues within GWS. So we -- it's about 6% of the total revenue, fee revenue and GWS, and it grew at a similar pace, maybe slightly lower growth rate than we showed in the Advisory business. But obviously the Advisory business is getting the bulk of the revenues on any deals that are won within GWS and are being executed in the field.Anthony Paolone -- JP Morgan -- AnalystOkay. And then just last question on Real Estate Investments segment, any further guideposts on Hana, and what the financial impact for 2019 is going to be, whether it's net drag or neutral or just how to put that in?James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentIt's a modest net drag and it's in line with our guidance. So we are running in line with our guidance on the impact of Hana.Anthony Paolone -- JP Morgan -- AnalystOkay. Thanks, Jim for all your help over the years.James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentThank you, Anthony.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.Stephen Sheldon -- William Blair -- AnalystGood morning. First, I think you talked about leasing fee revenue growing high-single digits this year back in March, obviously really strong results there this quarter. I think some of your competitors seeing similar trends, so just wanted to ask how leasing revenue came in, in the quarter relative to your expectations. And if your overall view on how that business could perform this year has changed at all, realizing that comparisons get more difficult.Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Leasing, we expected it to be strong and it was stronger than we expected it to be. There is a lot of account-based work in the market that plays really well to our offering. So you've seen us take market share, you've seen the market be really strong. This ongoing trend to use in office space use, the space to attract, retain, make employees more efficient, improve morale, is really a compelling trend and it is impacting the amount of work out there with big occupiers, and again it plays quite well to us because we have this integrated offering with Workplace Solutions, with technology support, with lots of stuff that we do to help those types of tenants. So, we expected a strong quarter, we expect a strong year, but the quarter was stronger than we expected.Stephen Sheldon -- William Blair -- AnalystOkay, that's helpful. And then I guess within the Advisory Solutions, can you maybe talk through some of the factors that drove the adjusted EBITDA margin expansion there? I think you talked about a positive impact from solid top line growth, revenue mix and cost management. I guess, how should we think about the contribution from each of those factors and the potential for continued margin expansion there over the remainder of the year?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I would say we talked about the margin expansion and it was across the board. It was in both the Advisory and the GWS business. Combined, they were up about 190 basis points. We noted that about a quarter of that increase came from kind of lumpier items such as recognizing MSR gains, a little FX, some pension cost that didn't reoccur. But the rest were all kind of fundamental drivers to the business. So we did guide to increased operating margins throughout the year, Q1 performance was better than we expected.Stephen Sheldon -- William Blair -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Green with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.Jason Green -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystGood morning. On the sales side with the year-over-year declines, are you seeing any drying up of the amount of capital that's out there to invest, or is it really just uncertainty related to the macro and people preferring to wait it out to put capital to work.Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerI would say there is -- it's more the latter, some uncertainty about what's going to happen. But there is an awful lot of both equity and debt capital on the sidelines ready to get into commercial real estate. And while the market is off, it's still overall a healthy market, you know significant amount of trading going on. So, I would suggest it's uncertainty, but no lack of capital anywhere in the world for good assets.Jason Green -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystGot it. And then on the leasing side, given some of the uncertainty is weighing on sales, can you talk about the length of leases that tenants are pursuing, if they are longer or shorter term in nature? Just the mentality of tenants overall as they look for space right now.James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentYeah. The mentality of tenants looking for space is quite strong. And as we've seen in our own business, we've been upgrading our own space, spending more money on our own space to compete for the top talent around the world and we're finding our customers doing the same thing. As far as lease terms, specifically they've migrated up a bit, about -- maybe about six months in length over the last three or four years. So there's a little bit of increase going on there. We also have rent growth which has been running at about 4%. So that's a nice little tailwind as well and that's been the case for about 18 months now.Jason Green -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystGot it. And then last one from me on the Hana (inaudible) deals expected to be announced, as a proportion of the building that they have seen, how big are those deals and how are landlords or landowners kind of thinking about how much Hana space they're willing to have in their building?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerWell, the size of the typical Hana unit is not really that dependent on the size of the building. And so if it's a smaller building, it's a bigger percentage of the building, but certainly landlords have no problem at all, having upwards of 5% to 10% of the space in some buildings being in a Hana type unit.Jason Green -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystYes, I was wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing in the M&A environment, and if you could identify or give some thoughts around potential business lines that you might look at, would you look at M&A in the capital markets side of the business, or are you looking to grow more recurring contractual types of businesses?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, sure, Jade. The M&A pipeline is, I would say, strong as it's ever been. We closed three infill acquisitions since the beginning of the year. As far as the capital markets, we're not, I mean we're always kind of attentive to where we are in the business cycle and the cyclicality of different businesses. That said, there are ways to structure deals. But we're generally on the more conservative side of our underwriting, as we are -- even though the business fundamentals are excellent. We are in the later stages of long economic cycle. So, we've got to, I'd say, the pipelines are strong as it has ever been, but we are taking a conservative point of view on underwriting.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystOkay. In terms of the capital markets environment, could you make any comments on how 2Q pipelines, deal activity, interest levels has been so far? Is some of the 1Q softness spill over from the volatility that played out in December? Are you seeing something more widespread as far as the trend goes?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, we do think the volatility in December impacted the Q1 results. Our expectations for capital markets for the year have not really changed since we gave our first -- our year-end numbers and our expectations for the year. But there was some impact in the first quarter due to that December volatility.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystHas any of that started to improve, so far second quarter? I am not asking about guidance, but just a market comment.Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, we really haven't changed our view on where capital markets and sales are headed, other than to acknowledge, there was some impact of the December volatility in those first quarter numbers.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystOkay. In terms of leasing, is the majority being driven, the majority of the growth being driven by technology, flex space, and industrial?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThe majority of the growth is being driven by office space use, but not necessarily just technology, about 23% of our leasing in Q1 was to technology companies, that's been running over the last couple of years, more like 20%. So technology was up a little, but not a lot. But definitely the growth in our leasing numbers was driven by office space, all manner of office users.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystWhat about co-working and flex space within that office leasing growth?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerAbout 2% of the growth we experienced in leasing; two points of the total number of growth points came from co-working or flexible space.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystSo in that range like it's actually lower than the rest of the market, would you agree with that? I had saw a JLL 1Q report that showed about 20% of leasing activity in the first quarter was driven by flex space?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerIt was not 20% of our leasing, it did contribute to growth. It did contribute to year-over-year growth, but it was a smaller percentage than that for us.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystOkay. And just lastly, on the writedown within investment management, what was the triggering mechanism for that? The trend toward passive investment strategies, it's taking place over multiple years and you also completed your annual review several months ago, so wondering what drove that impairment, the timing of it?James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentYeah, we review all of our accounts every quarter. And we had some feedback on a couple of accounts, specifically that they were going to be moving to more passive strategies.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystOkay, where they separately managed accounts?James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentNo, I'd rather not get into the details of the specifics of the accounts, but those were the triggering events.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystOkay, thanks very much.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James Financial. Please proceed with your question.Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- AnalystHey, good morning guys. So, first, I was wondering if you can give an update on your outlook for your -- for the GSE lending business, obviously some leadership turnover and a lot of statements being made in DC right now. What are your current thoughts on the outlook for that?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThe first quarter was very strong. We do expect that that will taper, both agencies are guiding to, I think, down about 5%. They've fixed -- their caps haven't changed, but they've gotten tighter on some of the exceptions to the caps. So, we think the Director or Collaborator will continue to kind of focus on shrinking that footprint over time, but in a very gradual way over many years.Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- AnalystGot it. And then second question, maybe just a higher level strategic question, how much thought have you guys given to trying to monetize the data that you collect as the largest commercial real estate service provider in the world? So, you obviously have a lot of internal tools that you leverage for your internal employees. But then when you see firms like CoStar, it's got a $18 billion market cap, you have seen some deals in the space. Obviously, the data is valuable. To what extent have you guys explored whether you can monetize your data?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerPatrick, we think about that from time to time, but we do monetize our data. Now we use our data extensively to support the revenue that we generate across our business, our leasing business, we use data extensively in our GWS business, in our capital markets business. The notion of separately selling data, it's something we talk about from time-to-time, but the main way we are using data now is to support our own clients.Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- AnalystIs it a concern that would be that if you were to separately sell it, then maybe you'd be losing some of your competitive advantage by providing high quality data to your competitors?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerI think the main concern is that we're really focused on the work we're doing, the lines of business we have, and we have a really, really strong digital and technology team, we've built, and we've got them focused in that area now. We will consider over time and we talk about from time-to-time what we might do beyond that, but for the moment we think the right focus is on the lines of business and the clients we have doing, the things we're doing for those clients now.Jade Rahmani -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystAll right. Got it. That's interesting. Thank you so much.OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Germain with JMP Group. Please proceed with your question.Mitch Germain -- JMP Securities -- AnalystGood morning. Have any of the fundamental drivers of facilities management shifted? I know cost initiatives -- cost savings is a very primary driver, but have you seen any shift in that over the last 12 to 24 months?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerCost is still a really big driver in that business, but increasingly anything we do for occupiers is being impacted by the experience we create in this space that they occupy or the experience we help them create. So we have this new offering Host, which is a combination of a technology platform and a group of more legacy type services that we do for clients. We do a lot of Workplace Solutions consulting for our occupier clients that help drives that business. We manage office space today with 9 million people in and around the world and they are increasingly asking us to do experience type work for them. So, that's a driver that exists to the degree it does today, even a year ago, or certainly two years ago, but cost is still a very, very big element of that business.Mitch Germain -- JMP Securities -- AnalystAnd are customers looking to consolidate to one provider, or are you still looking at a lot of different shared services based on whether it'd be geography or regions or something like that?Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerClients are looking to consolidate to fewer providers, a good number of them want to work with one provider if they can find a provider that can do the things they need in terms of the breadth of services and the geographic footprint. And we have, as I said in my comments earlier, won a number of large accounts on a single provider basis because our clients now believe we can do things that two or three years ago, before GWS, before our organic growth, before FacilitySource, we couldn't do and certainly nobody else could do.Mitch Germain -- JMP Securities -- AnalystGot you. And then last question, I apologize, I know you mentioned (inaudible) the builders of the EBITDA margin expansion, looks like a 190 basis points Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions, where's the remaining one-third yet? And how much of it came from Real Estate Investments business line?James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentThe 190 basis points I referenced is 100% from within the services businesses, from within GWS and Advisory. So zero that margin expansion came from the Real Estate Investments businesses. And most of it is really just fundamentals, it's business mix, it's growth in the business and its cost control.Mitch Germain -- JMP Securities -- AnalystJust want to follow up on that. So the gains from the development in the co-investment income, how much of that contributed to the margin?James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentAgain, the 190 basis points that I've referenced for the two services businesses, zero -- that does not include any impact from any of the Real Estate Investments businesses. That's purely in the two services businesses combined. And both businesses did very nicely on the margin expansion, both segments.Mitch Germain -- JMP Securities -- AnalystThanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.Ryan Tomasello -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystGood morning. This is actually Ryan Tomasello swapping in for Jade. Thanks for taking the follow-up. For Hana, you talked about this year, but just looking beyond 2019, can you say what you expect for stabilized economics or returns in that business? And then perhaps discuss your approach with regards to choosing between the business model in Hana between outright leases or partnership in management agreements with owners, which of those you prefer?James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentSure. We have a strong preference for partnership. We got into this business because our clients on both sides, landlords and occupiers, are asking us for help in this area. So these are massive very, very important clients to us. Our focus is delivering what these clients want. And so we have a strong preference to be in partnership with them or on a fee for service basis with them. As we've said, we will sign leases here and there, just to get scale and experience, but that's our preferred business model. We haven't given guidance past 2019.Ryan Tomasello -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystI mean not asking for specific guidance, but just in terms of high level return expectations or margins in the business longer term, if you can, if not understandable.James R. Groch -- Chief Financial Officer and Global Director of Corporate DevelopmentYeah, I mean any place we deploy capital, we are looking for a very strong return on that capital risk-adjusted return, but I wouldn't get into more detail than that at this point.Ryan Tomasello -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystOkay, fair enough. Thanks for taking the follow-up.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Sulentic for any final comments.Robert E. Sulentic -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks for being with us everyone and we look forward to talking to you again end of the second quarter.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.Duration: 38 minutesCall participants:Brad Burke -- Investor RelationsRobert E.
