[Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Jackson.\nMa'am, you may begin.\nMary A. Jackson -- Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Apogee Enterprises Fiscal 2018 Full-Year and Fourth-Quarter Conference Call on Thursday, April 12, 2018. With us on the line today are Joe Puishys, CEO, and Jim Porter, CFO. Their remarks will focus on our fiscal 2018 full-year and fourth-quarter results and our outlook for fiscal 2019 and beyond.\nDuring the call, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about Apogee's performance. You can find definitions for these non-GAAP financial measures in our press release. We've called out adjusted earnings related to our recent acquisitions and restructuring, and tables reconciling non-GAAP financial measures are included in the release. Our call also contains forward-looking statements reflecting management's expectations based on currently available information.\n\nActual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect the Apogee's business and financial results can be found in our SEC filings. Joe will discuss Apogee's progress against the strategic transformation in fiscal 2018 and plans for fiscal 2019, and then Jim will cover the results. After they conclude, Joe and Jim will answer your questions.\nJoe?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Apogee's conference call. Today, after I provide commentary on fiscal 2018 and outlook for fiscal 2019 and beyond, Jim will provide his usual financial detail. And before I take your questions, I will share my longer-term view of Apogee in the context of the difference in our company today versus the last cycle.\nPlease stay on the call. We finished fiscal 2018 with performance in the fourth quarter that met our expectations, as all four segments delivered on their forecast. In addition, in the quarter, we've reported higher-than-projected benefits from the tax reform and active tax planning as usual. For the full year, we achieved record revenues, record adjusted earnings per share, and generated a $127 million in operating cash flow, and significantly expanded our backlog in our longer-lead time businesses to build momentum as we enter 2019 and beyond.\nAgainst this backdrop, in fiscal 2018, we advanced our strategies to diversify revenue streams and strengthen our business in order to deliver shareholder value. Our strategies are centered on growing through new geographies, new products, and new markets, while improving margins through productivity and project-selection initiatives. We have been positioning each of our four segments to achieve new levels of performance. We're strategically focused on architectural framing systems, which is our largest and most profitable architectural segment.\nThe segment now serves more of North America with a broader range of products through our acquisitions and numerous new product introductions in every business unit. And we're driving organic expansion into underserved geographies in the United States and western Canada. Beyond current plans, the architectural framing systems has plenty of runway to continue to grow through new geographies and products into improved margins through ongoing lean initiatives. We continue to penetrate midsized markets in architectural glass and are being awarded more large projects while reducing fixed cost through the fourth-quarter closure of our Utah facility.\nOur glass segment is also moving forward with strategies to pursue expansion into broader architectural glass markets. Our new initiatives, made possible by recent capability, and productivity investments, will expand the already strong EBIT and cash flow contributions from this business. Architectural glass bidding, awards, orders, and margin trends are positive as we start fiscal 2019, which bodes well for the second half-fiscal 2020 and beyond. The architectural services segment has the backlog and order-pipeline strength to support growth in fiscal years 2019 and fiscal 2020.\nExcluding the sizable EFCO backlog, we moved into the services segment in the fourth quarter. The services organization won substantial number of projects in fiscal 2018, to grow their backlog by more than $100 million this year. The business now has had five consecutive quarters of substantial backlog growth. In fiscal 2017, we stated we were experiencing a timing issue, and a timing issue only, with regard to the backlog reductions at that time.\nI believe there was skepticism. We proved our point in fiscal '18, and while this timing gives us optic -- gave us optic issues in F '18, F '19 will show substantial improvement. Our investment in new market sectors for our large-scale optical glass and acrylic products are expected to deliver growth for this high-margin segment in fiscal 2019. We've regularly highlighted our investments in this business and they are now paying dividends.\nIn addition, our building retrofit team, which won $40 million in new orders in fiscal 2018 is being expanded to help us better penetrate the substantial United States market of older buildings needing aesthetic and energy-efficient upgrades. I believe the tax benefits from the new reform law will drive more building owners and managers to consider renovating older properties to keep them competitive with newer buildings, as clearly the tax relief provides upward movement on their ROIs for these projects. At the same time, we expect that retrofit revenues will be more steady through the ups and downs of the commercial construction cycles, again, one of my key initiatives. During fiscal 2018, we continued to reshape our business mix to be more centered on architectural framing systems segment, which again outperformed our commercial construction markets.\nRevenues from the legacy businesses in this segment were up 9% year over year, and operating margin was up triple digits. Our legacy businesses again delivered superior performance through increased pricing, share gains, increased geographic penetration, new product introduction, and productivity improvement. This has been the story for five-plus years now and we have a lot of runway ahead of us. Our acquisition of EFCO, which is part of architectural framing systems, expands our U.S.\ngeographic penetration and product offering. It's an ideal fit for Apogee, with operations very similar to those in our other framing systems businesses. Although it's come with challenges, we have the expertise and resources to bring EFCO up to Apogee levels of performance. That said, we now recognize that we are approximately 18 months behind and starting from a lower point in our EFCO margin-improvement process.\nThis reality impacted Apogee's fiscal 2018 margins, and will do so in fiscal 2019. Yet this business still has all the upside, it does everything our legacy businesses do. Already, we've identified purchasing savings at EFCO that are beginning to capture in fiscal 2019 by leveraging buying of common materials. And we have line of sight for additional savings in fiscal 2020.\nWe have started executing on operational improvements, and are being spearheaded by Apogee's senior vice president of operations, who is now the president of EFCO. We've approved investment in equipment, automation, and other productivity efforts at EFCO. We brought Apogee expertise to project-execution challenges we inherited at EFCO, allowing us to effectively manage the projects with no expectations for additional surprises. We have put in place a proven process for project selection, a model that has led to improved operating margins in our other Apogee businesses.\nWe are seeing increased order activity as we are improving our on-time delivery of products to customers. I'd like to repeat that EFCO is an excellent fit for Apogee. We're committed to making it a great business in our portfolio, and it has the full potential and ability to perform at Apogee framing systems levels. I'll comment on fiscal 2018 performance and our three other segments before moving to our outlook for 2019.\nIn the large-scale optical segment, we've maintained our strong 25% operating margin on flat revenues, and as the year progress, investments that had been made in new display markets have begun to generate significant awards, supporting an outlook for good growth in this segment in fiscal 2019. The business is centered on the same coating technology we use in architectural glass. It manufactures repetitive, though very high value-added products, allowing the greater efficiencies that yield high margins. As we guided in fiscal 2018, architectural services results were down on a year-over-year basis as a result of project timing.\nAt the same time, we've been clear that the business will be back to substantial growth in revenues and profit in fiscal 2019 due to the significant backlog build that occurred during fiscal 2018 and, frankly, late in fiscal 2017 as well. I'm encouraged that the bidding activity remains strong for projects expected to revenue well into fiscal 2021. As we manage growth in services, we continue to benefit from its high ROIC and cash generation. Architectural glass results were impacted by large projects lost a few years ago to international competitors and a decline in the product mix as we began to pursue less complex midsized projects midway through fiscal 2018 to continue gaining share.\nLet me be clear, the larger, more complex value-added midsized projects continue to have attractive and better margins. It is encouraging that architectural glass commitments, today, are currently at 25% ahead of they were -- where they were one year ago at this exact point and bidding activity is strong. In fiscal 2018, Apogee made progress on our strategies to diversify and strengthen our business. And we'll leverage business opportunities in fiscal 2019 and beyond to deliver shareholder value.\nTurning to our outlook for the new year. We continue to be optimistic about Apogee and our outlook for our end markets. In fiscal 2019, we'll continue our momentum in transforming the company to deliver more stable revenue streams and earnings for the long term. We are focused on delivering operational improvements to realize our profitability goals while we pursue investments that will serve as catalysts for revenue growth and operating-margin improvement in 2020 and beyond.\nIn fiscal 2019, we expect to grow revenues approximately 10% and achieve a record level of operating income and earnings per share. We anticipate a year-on-year increase in operating margin, although the adjusted operating margin will decline, primarily due to the impact of the EFCO business, which we expect to be at breakeven in fiscal 2019. As I noted earlier, EFCO is a perfect fit for us and we have the expertise and resources to improve the margins. Major initiatives for fiscal 2019 continue to focus on productivity and also include investing in a geographic expansion in our framing system segment to continue our share-gain success and pursuing initiatives in architectural glass to expand revenues in broader architectural markets.\nAt the same time, we'll leverage recent investments to grow large-scale optical revenues and execute the large architectural-services backlog. Our positive outlook is supported by external forecasts for continued U.S. commercial construction growth. And our visibility includes a healthy backlog and a pipeline of projects we are bidding.\nU.S. macroeconomic indicators remain robust, although the longer-term impact of recent tariffs on aluminum and steel goods has yet to be determined. Canadian economic indicators are also healthy. Regarding commercial construction markets, the ABI and Dodge Momentum Index continue to indicate future growth.\nAnd project starts in Canada are anticipated to rebound in fiscal 2019 as well, certainly based on forecast from ConstructConnect. Apogee's internal visibility supports our outlook for growth through fiscal 2020 and into fiscal 2021 for longer lead-time work. Although we are not providing fiscal 2020 guidance, we are projecting continued growth in revenue and operating income out two years. We are not seeing any slowdown in commercial construction markets beyond fiscal '21 either, but that is too far out to guide.\nWe have a great business that is delivering value to shareholders as we execute our strategies to diversify and strengthen our company. Jim will now provide more details on the financials.\nJames S. Porter -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Joe. Good morning. I'll start with additional discussion of full-year results and then review fourth-quarter results and our fiscal 2019 outlook. Fiscal 2018 saw record revenues for Apogee, up 19% to $1.3 billion, but down 4% excluding the Sotawall and EFCO framing systems acquisitions.\nWe had a decline in architectural-services revenues, which was largely as expected and driven by timing of project activity, which we knew coming into fiscal 2018. Despite growth in midsized projects, architectural glass revenues were down due to a lower volume of larger projects and hurricane-related delays. Revenues in our smallest segment, large-scale optical, were down slightly. Offsetting these declines was 75% of revenue growth in architectural framing systems, with 9% segment growth excluding the EFCO and Sotawall acquisitions, from increased pricing and continued share gains and geographic growth.\nGross margin was 25.1%, compared to 26.2% in fiscal 2017. The full-year operating margin of 8.6% and adjusted operating margin of 10% were down from 11% and 11.2% respectively in the prior year. Both gross and operating margins were down with reduced volume leverage in architectural services and architectural glass, inclusion of EFCO currently at lower margins, and costs for shutdown of the architectural glass factory in Utah all somewhat offset by improved productivity across all segments. Fiscal 2018 earnings per diluted share were $2.76 and adjusted earnings per share were up 7% to a record of $3.23.\nFull-year and fourth-quarter earnings per share reflect net tax benefits of $0.13 per share, or $3.7 million, resulting from enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of December 2017, primarily from the reduction in deferred income tax liabilities. Included in our operating-margin and earnings-per-share adjustments are acquisition-related costs and amortization of short-lived acquired intangibles associated with the acquired backlogs of Sotawall and EFCO, as well as fourth-quarter restructuring-related costs. A reconciliation of adjustments is included in our press release. With regard to our balance sheet and cash flow and our approach to capital allocation, we're committed to shareholder-return initiatives while funding organic and acquisition growth and investing for productivity.\nWe believe Apogee has the cash flow characteristics to support all of these objectives. Related to acquisition specifically, our clear focus now is on integration of EFCO and recognizing the margin opportunities that we have there. We still look at opportunities, but in the near term, our focus is on the EFCO business. For fiscal 2018 and the balance sheet, our full-year operating cash flow was $127 million and free cash flow for the year was $74 million.\nWe continue to have strong working capital-management discipline. Full-year capital spending of $53 million was focused on productivity and capability investments, primarily for architectural glass for new products and automation to continue to improve our cost structure. Apogee's cash dividend was increased 12.5% in the fourth quarter, and the company paid dividends of $16.4 million in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018, Apogee repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of our common stock, which we believe was a good investment to create value.\nThe tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 27.7%, compared to 30.1% in the prior year. Both years included one-time discrete benefits with the current year, also including tax reform benefit. Debt at year-end was $216 million. Net interest expense for the year was $5 million, compared to 0 in fiscal 2017, due to the increase in debt to support our recent acquisition.\nTurning to the fourth-quarter segment results. Architectural framing systems segment revenues were up 51% in the fourth quarter. Excluding acquisitions, revenues in the quarter were down 4% compared to a strong prior-year period due to year-on-year project-timing differences. The year-on-year adjusted operating margin for the framing system segment was 10.3% versus 12%.\nTriple-digit basis-point increases in operating margins from legacy businesses were offset by the addition of EFCO, which has a lower operating margin profile currently. As Joe discussed, while we are behind on our previous expectations for margin improvement at EFCO, we continue to see our path to double-digit operating margins for this business. As detailed in our press release, architectural framing segment backlog grew $27 million sequentially, excluding the EFCO backlog that was transferred during the quarter to architectural services. At the end of the fourth quarter, architectural framing backlog was $405.7 million.\nThe project pipeline and bidding activity for this segment remains strong. Fourth-quarter architectural services revenues increased 3% in the quarter. We came into the year knowing that project timing had a good deal of work that had moved to flow later in fiscal 2018 and in fiscal 2019. In the fourth quarter, we started to see these projects generate revenue.\nOperating income grew 52% and operating margin was 9.3% in the quarter due to improved operating performance, mix of project maturity, and lower insurance cost on slightly higher volume. We're pleased with the significant improvement in operating results, but this segment has quarter-to-quarter margin volatility just based on project mix and volume. So we don't see a 9%-plus operating run rate yet. Architectural services had sequential backlog growth of $10 million, excluding the backlog transfer from architectural framing.\nFourth-quarter backlog was up significantly at $426.3 million. Bidding activity remains strong for projects expected to revenue into fiscal 2021. We manage this business around project-management capacity for execution rather than to drive growth. Looking forward, we may not see, and don't need to see, continued sequential growth in backlog.\nAs we recognize revenue on the workbook, we look to replace it with new orders, but this segment has lumpy new-order timing, resulting in quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in backlog levels. Architectural glass fourth-quarter revenues declined to 18% compared to a very strong prior-year fourth quarter. The architectural glass operating margin was 4.4%, compared to 12.3% in the prior-year period, on reduced volume, lower market pricing and mix on less complex products, and cost for closure of the Utah facility, partially offset by productivity gains. The adjusted operating margin was 7.7%.\nThe shutdown of the Utah facility was efficient, and it came in at a slightly lower cost than originally anticipated. Our team worked hard to facilitate reemployment efforts for our workers and are happy that more than half of the employee base had new jobs by the time of the closure, with good progress being made for remaining employees. Finally, although the large-scale optical segments revenues were down slightly on timing of orders from national retailers, operating income was up slightly and operating margin was 29.8% versus 26% on improved mix and cost management. Backlog mix across the three architectural segments reflects strong activity in the office sector and multifamily residential sectors.\nEach had almost 40% of the overall work in backlog. Institutional, which is government, education, and healthcare, is 15% to 20% of backlog, and less than 5% of the backlog is for projects in the hotel, entertainment, and transportation sector. The mix of multifamily projects increased, driven primarily by a few larger high-end projects, many with multiuse characteristics. The tax rate for the quarter was 14.8%, compared to 21.9% in the prior-year period.\nI'll turn now to our outlook for fiscal 2019. We continue to feel good about Apogee's future, and we expect top-line and operating-income growth in fiscal 2019. We expect 10% revenue growth, driven by growth in our architectural framing and architectural services segments. Our fiscal 2019 growth outlook by segment is for architectural framing is expected to be up approximately 10%, with continued share, geographic, and new-product gains in our legacy businesses.\nArchitectural services are expected to be up 30% compared to a low fiscal 2017 base. Large-scale optical up in the single-digits as new market initiatives begin to bear fruit. And architectural glass is expected to be flat to up slightly. Our outlook is for an operating margin range of 8.8% to 9.3%, up from 8.6% in fiscal 2018.\nThe outlook for adjusted operating margin is 9.1% to 9.6%, compared to the adjusted operating margin of 10% in the prior year. By segment, we are expecting an improving operating margin at architectural glass to almost 10%. A triple-basis-point margin improvement in architectural services to almost 6.5%. The architectural framing systems operating margin will decline to approximately 8%, with improved margins for the legacy group of businesses offset by the full-year impact of EFCO in the margin profile.\nAnd we expect close to a 25% operating margin in large-scale optical. We have come off our previous expectation for a 100-basis-point overall margin improvement for fiscal 2019, primarily driven by the lower expectations for EFCO in fiscal 2019. As Joe indicated, we're expecting breakeven at EFCO in fiscal 2019 due to lower volume and delays to achieve operational improvement. As we previously stated, EFCO has had a low starting point, as we had a longer journey to margin improvement.\nWe remain optimistic about the longer-term opportunities for this business and its contributions to Apogee. We're making good progress against synergies we have identified, as Joe laid out. Through these initiatives to date, we have identified and have planned for more than $5 million in annual savings that will begin to flow through later in fiscal 2019 and going forward. In terms of overall timing expectations for fiscal 2019, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half.\nWe don't provide quarterly guidance, but based on visibility that we have from the project schedules that we service, I want to give some visibility that the first quarter will be down significantly year over year for architectural glass. And therefore, most of the architectural framing systems growth in the first quarter will be from inclusion of EFCO, which is at lower margin. So these factors are expected to drive lower margins in the first quarter. Again, based on our visibility, the schedules pick up nicely in the second quarter for these segments, and overall revenues are fairly balanced starting in the second quarter over the rest of the year, with growth every quarter.\nEarnings per diluted share are expected to range from $3.30 to $3.50, with adjusted earnings per share of $3.43 to $3.63. Fiscal 2019 capital expenditures for productivity, capabilities, and capacity are expected to be $60 million to $65 million. We anticipate that our fiscal 2019 tax rate will be approximately 24%. I'd like to underscore, it is not our plan to give up tax cash savings by lowering our margin requirements.\nThat noted, however, most of our U.S. competitors are not public companies; we can't be assured that they will have the same discipline, which we'll monitor. For fiscal 2019, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $55 million. I'd like to briefly comment on some recent inflation pressures affecting our industry.\nWe're seeing trade policy uncertainty affecting aluminum and we've seen cost increases in freight and lumber. Our outlook covers current cost estimates for these items, and we're able to forward-purchase a majority of the aluminum that we used. We monitor these costs and projections, and continually adjust our bid pricing where possible. For shorter lead-time businesses, we are focused on raising prices to offset additional -- any additional increases.\nAnd we've recently seen the industry respond rationally as well. The risk that we have is that competitors won't continue to offset these inflationary items with pricing. We continue to expect sustained growth for Apogee based on our internal visibility for backlog, awards, and bidding and forecast for low- to mid-single-digit growth in U.S. commercial construction markets, at least through fiscal 2020.\nWe have good momentum and solid strategies that we believe continue to position us to perform better in any economic environment. I'll turn the call back to Joe for closing comments.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Jim. Before I take your questions, I'd like to reiterate my positive view of the longer-term outlook for Apogee, that is in no small part a result of the transformation as a company over the last half decade plus. Seven years ago, Apogee was less than $600 million in revenues and glass was 40% of Apogee. And a dominant percent of glass was tall towers.\nAnd hence approximately one-third of Apogee was tied to the most volatile segment within nonresidential construction. When the end markets crashed, so did we, no surprise. And we chased limited work with price, a mistake we'll never make again. We had weak operations, excellent processes [ph], and no lean strategies in place.\nWe embarked on an effort to completely reprofile Apogee. To focus on the more fragmented and higher-margin architectural framing system segment, where we were underserved. To focus our acquisitions in this segment, to gain share, improve our cost structure, and build a retrofit selling model and staff it. None of this was at the expense of investing for capability and productivity in our other segments.\nToday, framing systems is more than 50% of Apogee with triple-digit operating-margin improvement since this journey began. We're tripling the operating margin actually. Our acquisitions are smart ones, and while inorganic growth comes with challenges, the opportunities are huge, and the framing-systems runway is significant. At that time, our glass business was not pricing to the technologies we provided.\nWe immediately addressed pricing and began long-overdue investments in our factories. As the largest glass fabricator in the United States, we were not acting like it. As we had a massive foreign exchange hurdle thrown at us, we lost substantial share in our traditional core markets, as well as losing our export base. In spite of this, we rose to a 60-year historical high in revenue, earnings, and operating margin in F '17, both in glass and Apogee.\nWe did this by our factory productivity investments and equally massive share shift in the midmarket segment. And let me be clear, those margins were similar or better than the large-segment margin as the glass selections are of similar complexity. At the same time, we funded investments in all major factory processes to allow us to launch new coatings in oversized glass, margin accretive products. In fiscal 2018, we felt the full revenue brunt of the awards lost to international players, and we moved further downstream where projects have less value-added attributes to the glass.\nA mix of lower priced and margin product -- still good business, but impacting our operating margin in this segment last year. Our investments in this glass business will help further reduce our cost structure going forward. By the way, our dependence on large projects is now far less at glass and a mere fraction of what it was at Apogee just seven years ago. I'm also pleased to admit that with the current currency situation, we are now experiencing improvement in bidding and awards and many customers have come back to work with us.\nI can also assure you that not all the international competitors perform like our Viracon business with regards to on-time delivery and quality. Our services-segment business is admittedly the lumpiest we have. It's nearly impossible to book awards in a construction world to allow for perfect project-to-project timing. We like having a seat at the construction site.\nOur installed business is one of the best out there, and we have a national footprint executed locally and our ROIs are substantial. Our stated strategy for over five years has been to smartly manage the order profile of this business to let our project management capability and capacity drive the bid process and to not outgrow our ability to improve margins or execute projects well. Fiscal 2019 will highlight the soundness of this position. And lastly, our large-scale optical business has been a gem and will remain so.\nWe made what are large investments for that business, small for Apogee, to ensure this golden goose keeps delivering and grow. And again, you'll see the proof of those investments in fiscal 2019. This is not your father's Apogee. Tikia, I'd like to open up the call for questions now.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sam Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSamuel H. Eisner -- Goldman Sachs -- Vice President\nYeah. Good morning, guys.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Sam.\nSamuel H. Eisner -- Goldman Sachs -- Vice President\nCan we just start with EFCO? Obviously, the guidance for -- and I want to make sure I got this right, I think breakeven for EFCO in fiscal '19 -- kind of, when you guys are now in the business, what's going on? Maybe give us some greater clarity and color on why, I guess, profit expectations are not, kind of, matching up to what was originally thought?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nSam, primarily the large projects they embarked on a couple of years prior to or during the -- couple of years before they divested the company, they got out in front of their skis in areas that they weren't familiar with on large curtainwall projects. They -- hindsight, underestimated the cost and execution complexities of that. As we've gotten more involved in the business in the second half of calendar year 2017, we've realized that the problems were more substantial than we learned in due diligence, that's our fault. The -- we put the resources in place as these projects revenue, throughout fiscal 2019, we're going to feel the force of a lot of no-margin work.\nThe most complex work we have moved to our services segment to execute, and we feel good about that. And we put resources into EFCO to help them migrate to the kind of business they should be. And to have them focus on what they've always been good at, which is window work. And as I mentioned in my comments, I put a new president in, he's been one of our named executive officers at Apogee and running our operational program.\nHe is just what the doctor ordered, and I like the turnaround I'm seeing. You heard it before, but Sam, I feel we've uncovered all the surprises. And I'm confident now from a new starting point, our journey can begin. I think the work -- we've seen a real uptick in work in the last few months.\nAnd there has -- there's definitely a downward slope to their order -- their inbound order work. These large projects that were contributing to poor financial performance were contributing to a lack of attention to their core business. We've rectified that. After several months, we began to see the work return with improved quality and delivery and continue to do so.\nAnd I'm confident that the second half of the year will be better. We'll have most of these large projects behind us after the end of fiscal '19.\nSamuel H. Eisner -- Goldman Sachs -- Vice President\nGot it. And maybe going to, kind of, bridging that over to the guidance for fiscal '19. So I think the implied midpoint of your EBIT margin or operating profit margin is, let's call it, 9.3%, 9.4%. You did 10% this year, so down about 60, 70 basis points.\nThree months ago, you guys were saying triple-digit-basis-point margin expansion. So there's a swing there in a three-month period of roughly a 160 basis points. And so I'm curious, is there a way to break down what has changed in the guidance over the last three months? How much is related to EFCO of the 160? How much is related to inflation? How much is related to competition? Is there any kind of large buckets that you can provide us? I think that would be super helpful.\nJames S. Porter -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSam, it's Jim. The primary bucket is a change from an expectation that we're having of improving EFCO to be mid-single-digit operating margins to being breakeven. And really, from the visibility of the initiatives that we identified, the time that's going to take for those to flow into the business and the ability to ramp that up is really the top and most important difference between that ability to get that improvement.\nSamuel H. Eisner -- Goldman Sachs -- Vice President\nUnderstood. And then maybe if I can just sneak one more in. Jim, you mentioned a comment about inflationary environments and competition and that could be a risk. When you guys look back, and perhaps audit what you guys have seen over the last cycle, when you see intense inflation that you guys are experiencing now across all those various cost buckets, do you see competitive dynamics? I guess why provide that commentary about the risk? I guess have you seen it in the past or is that just something that you have to highlight?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nSam, I'll start. This is Joe. First of all, I'd like to tell you right now the last 60 days the spread between our price and material cost in our shorter-lead-time aluminum business is actually better than a year ago. So, so far we've been able to offset.\nThere's been a lot of movement recently, and the primary risk factor is aluminum. And the London Metal Exchange has been down, the Midwest premium has been up. There's been a lot of noise. It was somewhat de minimis.\nThe recent conversations around the Russian oligarchs really did turn a little more turmoil, but we've been able to continue to price to offset the inflation in our aluminum side. It would be foolish to not highlight risk. We do not intend to turn our tax reform benefits into lower pricing, but Sam, we have a lot of competitors that aren't public companies, so that's always a risk that folks don't follow the pricing model. Jim mentioned it, there has been greater industry intelligence in addressing input cost in the form of price decisions, so this has not been the historical case.\nIt has been for the last couple of years. We feel the risk is not significant, but we felt we had to point it out. I think the trend has been pricing keeping up with it, and we built our plan around some of that happening.\nJames S. Porter -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd I'll just echo, one of the points that Joe made. The risk is primarily with the framing system segment and primarily about aluminum more so than the other factors. And, as Joe said, over the last two years, we've seen the industry be quite disciplined in terms of pricing, and we continue to -- from what we can monitor, expect that. As Joe said, if you look historically, the industry tended to be a bit slow to adjust pricing to inflationary pressures, but our expectation would be that we've always seen the last two years to continue.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Sam, I'll add for you and the rest of the audience. Most of the aluminum we buy is from exempt countries. So when the tariffs were first announced, it was an alarm for everyone. We all expected it to be actually directed at one country.\nThat's primarily coming to fruition. The only countries in our supply chain that had not been exempted, we expect to be exempted very soon. So from the tariff perspective, we feel very limited risk. I am more concerned about the global supply.\nI think you all well aware how much the United States imports. So I think that some folks will try to take advantage of the rhetoric that's going on. But the reality of the matter is, the tariffs do not affect most of our supplying countries, Sam.\nSamuel H. Eisner -- Goldman Sachs -- Vice President\nThanks so much, and thanks for taking my question, guys.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Moore of CJS Securities. Your line is now open.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nTerrific. Good morning, guys. And maybe we could start on the services. So the -- I think the target operating margin was 6.5%.\nIs that being impacted at all by the EFCO -- $70 million in EFCO business that's coming into services?\nJames S. Porter -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell. Yes, a little bit. So they do -- it will have a relatively small amount of revenues, maybe 10% of their revenues, are going to be at lower margins than their overall mix of business.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. If you look at the backlog, just kind of on a -- put it into two buckets, between fiscal '19 and fiscal '20. Can you give a kind of a rough split?\nJames S. Porter -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIn -- the -- you're talking about in terms of how much of the backlog is expected to go fiscal '19 versus '20?\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nCorrect.\nJames S. Porter -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, I think about two-thirds of it is fiscal '19 and about one-third is fiscal '20 and beyond.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nChris, the important point that I'll add is, virtually all of fiscal 2019 planned revenues in that segment are in hand. This is the first year in a long time where we literally don't have book and bill requirements to achieve our plan in that business. It's quite de minimis. Usually, every year you enter with some blue sky where you have to win work and revenue some of it in the year.\nThe business is, for the most part, fully revenued for fiscal '19. So it really does bode well for that business. And in the glass business, even though the recent quarters have been down, as Jim mentioned, second, third, and fourth quarter we'll see year-over-year revenue growth. And I mentioned in my comments that in glass, the percentage of work we have in hand to support '20 -- the current-year revenues is 25% higher than where we stood last year.\nSo once again, we're far or less dependent on book and bill in the same year in the glass business as well.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGotcha. The 25%, kind of, that's just -- those four or five levels that you've talked about overall in terms of from backlog and beyond.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, we've always shied away from adding more non-GAAP metrics. But if you add the book backlog to awards, we're up about 25% over the prior year. We also have work we have verbally been given, or we feel we've won the projects going forward with somebody where it's -- we're the sole glass bidder and we have work we're bidding. Those four levels of visibility we often talk about.\nThe first two are the most concrete, and that's what I'm talking about when I say we're 25% ahead of last year.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. And on the glass side, you're talking about one of the things expanding into broader architectural glass markets. Can just talk about that a little bit further?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nYea, a bit more work on the interiors side, where we've been underserved. There's the outside skin of the building and then today's, most modern buildings going up, there's a lot more interior glass than years ago -- glass partitions, glass railings, glass walls versus the traditional cubicles, and we believe we can have a larger share of that and be more competitive as we move downstream in the mid and smaller projects world.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nAnd would you anticipate the margins there are relatively the same as on the outside or is this --\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nThe margins on the interiors and versus the margins on the outside?\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nYes.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I don't see, there's no margin difference there. The smaller projects as you move downstream, obviously, the complexity, the glass may only have a single silver coating, may not be heat-treated. They're at a lower price point. And -- but we believe we can achieve similar margins with our continued productivity and efficiency and automation investments.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks, guys. I'll return back in line.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Chris.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Stine of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.\nEric Stine -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nGood morning, everyone.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Eric.\nEric Stine -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nSo just wanted to start with glass. I know, especially last call, you called out increased competition in midsized projects. In your commentary here, really does not discuss that at all. So I'm just curious, have you seen that ease at all or do you feel like, I mean, is that just a nod to, that's going to be the current environment and you expect that to persist going forward and you've factored that into your outlook?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, Eric, I tried to address that today. I admit I did a poor job last quarter. I guess it came out as more price competition. That was not true.\nToday what I'm explaining, as we moved to offset the losses on our larger projects and had a substantial growth in our share in the midmarket segment, the margins were equally attractive as the large projects. And that was the case for all of F '17 and halfway into F '18. And we made the largest gain in our share in the midmarket, meaning smaller projects, in fiscal '17, where we had record earnings and record operating margin. That trend continued into F '18.\nIt's the middle of the year. We started to, kind of hit a wall on share gain. We weren't losing any share in the midmarket, but we ran into a wall of gaining more. We are tapped into a lot of the market.\nSo we moved downstream even further for the less complex projects. It doesn't mean we had to lower our prices, but we're now playing in a world where the glass content was less value-added. The competitors didn't necessarily lower price either, but it is a more competitive space. We continue to win share in that space, but it came in at lower margins, and we've amped up our efforts to be more cost-competitive to get back to the same kinds of margins in that business.\nUnfortunately, we continue to lose revenues in the large projects. Frankly, it was revenues that were lost to the awards a few years earlier. But that trend has turned around. So we feel good.\nSo, Eric, I hope I explained it better today with regards to -- it wasn't so much more competition as us continuing to step down, streaming to less complex projects.\nEric Stine -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nNo, that's perfect. That makes a lot of sense. I mean, just sticking there, obviously -- well in the past in terms of the euro you've talked about 120 as kind of being a key level, and I know it's fairly recent. The situation now -- so you're starting to see some regaining of share there? Is that something that you feel like has some legs?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nI do. Some of the largest installers in the country were the first to try to save a dollar by going offshore. Offshore fatigue definitely set in. We have great competitors around the world.\nA long logistics supply chain on -- 1% of the construction cost of the building is a very risky model, and it comes with unanticipated cost downsides that aren't easily attributed back to the glass per se. But as our valued customers experienced all the intricacies of that long logistic supply chain, they started coming back to us, frankly even before the currency moved to our favor. So the same people that didn't give us work for a few years have been bidding with us again and awarding us work, and we've won some projects against international players recently where we just couldn't be competitive at $1.05 per euro just 2 1/2 years ago. So, yes, you feel that there are legs on this, but we're running our business model to not be dependent on things beyond our control like currencies, and hence our continued investments in our -- to bring our cost structure down in our glass factories.\nEric Stine -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nYes, OK. Understood. Last question for me just on framing. I know you're talking about expanding that -- well, from a product perspective, also geographic perspective.\nI mean, how do you -- as we think about that going forward, how do you see that breaking down organically versus by acquisition?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, let me be clear. We're not looking to do acquisitions. Our focus is on EFCO. Our focus is on improving all of our businesses.\nJim and I will continue to keep our eyes out there. We'll keep irons in the fire. But there we will not be looking at inorganic growth in our framing systems business for the foreseeable future. I'm not going to tip hands to my competitors, where we're going, but let me just say we have a lot of runway in United States with geographic opportunities and framing systems as well as in Canada.\nEric Stine -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thielman -- D.A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst\nYeah, thanks, good morning.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nBrent Thielman -- D.A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst\nMaybe on the glass side, Joe. Do you still expect to grow in the midsized market in fiscal '19 or is that going to take a backseat kind of a top-line headwind as you shift more toward kind of large-project?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo, no. We have the capacity to grow. We expect to continue to see upward movement in the midsized segment. We don't feel that we're tapped out.\nAnd frankly, if you go back to the last downturn, which we don't ever expect to see a crisis like that, but our glass business, Viracon, tried, because the large projects evaporated. There was one large product in the United States back then -- it was World Trade Center. Our business, the company tried to penetrate that market and failed miserably because they didn't have the operational footprint to deliver in the four to five weeks that that segment requires. Our DNA was 15-week lead times for large projects.\nToday, and for the last several years, we virtually shipped every single order in five weeks today consistently, because we put the automation in place. And some of you have visited our factories, you have, there's a lot more automation and less material handling. And it's become our core model. So we're capable of competing in that market.\nWe're also capable of continuing to fix our cost structure so that our margins can continue to be at the high levels they've been.\nJames S. Porter -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd just to emphasize, Brent, along those lines, which is with the improvements that we've made in the operating model in that business, it isn't a \"or\" situation of large projects or midsized or adjacencies. We really have the capabilities and continue to work on the cost structure to do all of those.\nBrent Thielman -- D.A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst\nOK. And then the order activity you're seeing in large-project. Is it back at through the pricing or margin levels you'd expect from those sorts of job you were seeing at least a few years ago?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, the bidding activity is at good margins. There's nothing gone. We haven't seen any downward track in pricing or margins. I would tell you I think in the large project, the term I would use is the end markets continue to bump along the top.\nThere's no question the large [Inaudible] are up there. I do not believe they are peaking. I think we're going to continue to bump along the top for the foreseeable future. I think the mid, small, upper-mid market will continue to grow on a reasonably small slope, but they will grow.\nBut I think the large projects -- I feel good that we'll continue to bump along this high level of work in the large projects for the foreseeable future. And what doesn't always get captured in nonresidential is the continued strength in the multifamily high-rise buildings, which for all intent and purposes, is non-resi from our workload. Apartments and condos, which we have a much bigger play in now with our business model, as we continue to see the generation of new homebuyers moving into cities instead of the countryside, this bodes well for our company, frankly. And we're seeing that trend help to offset any other potential downturn.\nSo I see us bumping along the top for some time in large projects and continued growth in the mid and small projects.\nBrent Thielman -- D.A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst\nOK. On EFCO, Joe, I mean, obviously the transaction hasn't played out as you initially planned and now we're -- I mean, it seems to me we're looking at additional delays in kind of getting to the targeted margin. So I guess I'm looking for any sort of additional cover that you've got that sort of helps us feel like the risk is appropriately reflected here.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nI feel the risk is appropriately reflected here for EFCO. We definitely were -- had more surprises than we wanted and that you expected. That's on us. We've said it today, we believe we've now identified everything that we could with the business.\nIt was a challenge. I've got a new leader down there who's doing a phenomenal job. I'll be with the entire selling organization of EFCO tonight and tomorrow. And like I said, I'm pleased with the turnaround in order profile.\nWe've got the right leaders in place. We've taken the problems and put them in the hands of talented people in our company that have been managing large, massive projects for a long time. They got out in front of their skis, we didn't pick up how far they were. We now know.\nI believe we are -- our F '19 guidance reflects the full risk that that business had.\nJames S. Porter -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nBrent, I'll just give you a couple of perspectives. I mean, since we employed our current leader down there, a little over 60 days ago, some of the learnings, for example, we've talked about low-hanging fruit and procurement. And we've got meaningful savings identified. What we underestimated was, in some cases, maybe a spec change needed to be made to be able to flow that material in or finishing existing projects that have been started.\nSo a delay in terms of being able to see those. And some of that process improvements on the shop floor, we identified some modest-cost equipment that was needed. We placed orders for equipment and those types of things. So we have a tangible great list of initiatives.\nAs I articulated, it's just going to be put into place later than we were earlier anticipating.\nBrent Thielman -- D.A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst\nOK. And lastly and somewhat of a follow-on to that. I think, if you go back over time and I think about your guys' guidance practices and trying to be transparent where you want to be from a financial perspective, you've done a great job. I think it's easy for folks to kind of, look at recent history of guidance and be a bit skeptical about what you're talking about today.\nSo I guess a two-part question. It'd be 1) have you changed any processes in terms of how you're approaching and thinking about guidance? And 2) quite frankly, I mean, sub 5% EBIT growth, at least on an adjusted basis, seems pretty conservative to me. I mean, can you comment on that at least?\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nI'll comment on it, Brent. It's -- we put -- we're not going to get out in front of our skis. I believe we've got a plan that we will hit. And I can assure you we will continue to work our backsides off to not disappoint.\nAnd I'm not going to through another fiscal 2018.\nJames S. Porter -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe always look at our risk and opportunities in the business as we come up with our outlook. And I think we're taking a -- probably letting the risk-aspect approach guide us a little bit more now.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joe Puishys for closing remarks.\nJoseph F. Puishys -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, Tikia, thank you, and I apologize, if you were in the queue to ask a question, I will not ignore you. Please reach out to Mary Ann, Jim, or myself. You know how to reach us. We will talk to you.\nI apologize, a lot of questions today.
