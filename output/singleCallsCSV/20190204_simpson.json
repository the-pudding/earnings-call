Forward-looking statements, like any prediction of future events, are subject to factors which may vary, and actual results may differ materially from these statements. Some of these factors and cautionary statements are discussed in the Company's public filings and reports, which are available on the SEC's or the Company's corporate website.\nPlease note that the company's earnings press release was issued today at approximately 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time. The earnings press release is available on the Company's website at www.simpsonmfg.com. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will also be available on the Company's website.\nNow, I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Colonias, Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nThanks Madeleine, and good afternoon, everyone. 2018 was a year of solid operational execution at Simpson. We achieved consolidated full-year net sales of approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 10% from $997 million in 2017, due to increases in both sales volumes and average unit prices. This combined with our focus on cost cutting initiatives, resulted in our full-year of 2018 operating income of $176.2 million, increased 28% compared to the prior year period.\nNet income increased by 40% to $129.5 million, and reproduced strong earnings of $2.78 per diluted share, an increase of 43% year-over-year. Throughout 2018, we repurchased $111.1 million of our common stock, a record for Simpson, reflecting our continued confidence in the strength and outlook for our business. These results represent solid progress toward our key financial targets under the 2020 plan, which we announced in the third quarter of 2017, with the goal of maximizing operating efficiencies and driving long-term shareholder value.\nToday, I'm pleased to confirm, we remain focused on achieving these aggressive targets. These include, achieving an organic net sales compounded annual growth rate of 8%, reducing our total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales to the 26% to 27% range to result in an operating income margin of approximately 21% to 22%.\nDoubling our inventory turn rates and improving our return on invested capital for a range of 17% to 18%. As part of our 2020 Plan announcement, we also provided specific benchmark to achieve in fiscal 2018. These included; operating expenses as a percent of net sales in the mid 29% range, which we adjusted mid-year to be the mid 28% range. Our gross profit margin between 38% to 39% for our concrete business, and the European operating income margin of approximately 5%, excluding our SAP severance and goodwill impairment.\nIn relationship to the 2018 goals, we achieved the following. An operating expense, as a percent of net sales of 28.6%, an impressive 270 basis point improvement year-over-year. Concrete gross margin profit of 37% or slightly below our target. This reflects a significant improvement of 240 basis points year-over-year. We remain very pleased with the direction of our new concrete strategy that we began implementing in 2017, with a focus on more profitable products and market.\nEurope operating income margin of approximately 4.5%, excluding one-time items, this was slightly below our target, and we are currently reviewing additional opportunities and levers to improve Europe's bottom line in 2019. Our team worked hard to execute against these goals and the commitment from all of our employees to achieve our 2020 targets, is a testament to the strong company culture we have here at Simpson. I'd like to acknowledge and thank all employees for their hard work and dedication.\nI'd now like to take a few minutes to discuss some highlights from our fourth quarter financial results, before providing an update on operational initiatives. Fourth quarter net sales increased 4% year-over-year to $241.8 million, primarily due to increases in our average selling prices. Sales volumes in the fourth quarter was down on a year-over-year basis, as a result of softer U.S. housing starts and the timing of project based sales in Europe.\nU.S. housing starts, which are a leading indicator for approximately 60% of our business, were softer in the fourth quarter versus the comparable period last year, including in the Western and Southern regions of the US, where we provide meaningful amount of content into those homes due to stricter building design requirements from wind and earthquake concerns. We believe demand may have been impacted by uncertainty in regard to economic factors, given the extreme market volatility and the client experience in December. We acknowledge there is a hesitation in the market attributed to unpredictable economic conditions, labor shortages, and the potential for rise in interest rate. That said, there are many underlying factors to support healthy U.S. housing starts, including strong consumer confidence, extremely low unemployment rates, and low level of housing stock availability. Looking ahead, we expect demand to remain relatively stable. Demand in January was strong, a further indication that December buying patterns may have been postponed due to the short-term uncertainty. Over the long-term, we remain cautiously optimistic that the U.S. housing starts will increase at an annual mid-single-digit rate over the next few years.\nOur fourth quarter gross profit dollars were pressured by a combination of increased battery, material and labor costs, as well as one-time impacts related to inventory reduction initiatives. This resulted in a fourth quarter gross profit margin of 40.7% and ultimately impacted our full-year gross profit margin of 44.5% versus our projection of between 45.5% to 46%. Brian will discuss this in more detail shortly.\nWhile our full-year gross profit margin came in below our expectation, it is important to reiterate that our gross profit margin remains one of the highest in the industry. Much of this is attributed to our long-standing trusted brand reputation, which is built through proprietary testing capabilities, deep industry relationships, and superior customer service.\nNow, I'd like to provide an update on our key operating initiatives, which focus on rationalizing our cost structure to drive improved profitability, growing our market share and improving our technology and infrastructure to provide best-in-class service to our customers for years to come. In regards to growing our market share, the introduction of our mechanical anchor products into the Home Depot stores continues to progress. Throughout much of 2018 the roll-out occurred at a slower pace than our original expectations, due to space constraints at the Home Depot stores.\nOur mechanical anchor products were set in 91 Home Depot stores in 2018, bringing the total number to 373 Home Depot locations. Currently Home Depot has identified an additional 400 stores that we expect will be set by the end of the second quarter. We continue to anticipate the full roll-out into all 1,900 stores to be accomplished by the end of 2020, representing a $30 million annualized revenue opportunity once complete.\nIn Europe, the roll-out of the complete line of Gbo fastener products into the Nordic region and France is progressing on plan. And we continue to track in line with expectations, as it relates to increasing our presence in wood connectors in the Nordic area.\nNow moving to operational updates. In an effort to rightsize our product offerings, we have developed a three-phase SKU reduction program. Phase 1 was completed at the end of 2017, and involved eliminating approximately 10,000 non-moving SKUs from our ERP system. Throughout the course of 2018, we focused on Phase 2 of this program, which involves the identification and removal of over 2,500 slow moving SKUs. I'm pleased to report that this phase was completed at the end of 2018, and we have successfully converted all customers over to other products in our line.\nAt the start of 2019, we began focusing on the final Phase, which involves a further reduction of our SKUs. We believe, our newly implemented SAP system, as well as our learnings from our continued partnership with our external lean consultant will enable us to improve our management of inventory and purchasing practices.\nOur goal is an additional reduction of our product offering by approximately 25% by the end of 2020. While we continue to focus on improving our inventory turns, we are subject to fluctuating raw material pricing and tariff uncertainties in the marketplace, which are areas out of our business that we cannot control.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our inventory balance was approximately $276 million, an increase of $23 million or 9% year-over-year, as a result of increase in steel prices along with duties and tariffs on our finished goods from China. In the third quarter of 2018, we built our raw material position in an effort to mitigate the impact of steel price increases and availability. Currently, we believe, steel prices will remain stable in the first quarter of 2019, and we will continue to be cautious about our steel inventory.\nDuring 2018, we worked with the management consultants to uncover additional areas to enhance our overall efficiencies. Based on their findings, we had implemented programs to improve our operating expenses and working capital, and will incur some success-based fees in 2019 based on the benefits that we receive. We are pleased with the outcome of this partnership and look forward to realizing these efficiencies from the findings on a go-forward basis.\nIn 2019, our consultant activity will focus primarily on additional lean initiative. Our SAP implementation continues on track toward our companywide implementation goal for completion in 2021. We remain focused on rolling out SAP technology in our remaining U.S. branches, which we expect will take until early 2020 to complete.\nIn summary, I'm very pleased with our 2018 results and operational execution. Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic housing starts will remain at a healthy level. We are pleased with the solid demand we experienced in January, and we are monitoring the more severe weather conditions, we are currently experiencing compared to the year-ago period, which was unusually dry and a warmer winter. We remain committed to executing against our 2020 plan, and focusing on the areas of our business that we can control to ensure long-term sustainable growth, enhanced operating leverage and profitability with a goal of continuing to return capital to our valued shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Brian, who will discuss our fourth quarter financials in detail.\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nThank you, Karen, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to discuss our fourth quarter financial results with you today. Our consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $241.8 million, up 4% compared to $231.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Within the North America segment, net sales increased 7% year-over-year to $204.7 million, primarily due to increases in average net sales unit prices.\nIn Europe, net sales decreased 9% year-over-year to $34.9 million. Europe net sales were impacted by reduced sales volumes in our concrete business, as we experienced strong demand for asphalt paving products in 2017, that did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2018 at the same level. Europe net sales were also negatively affected by approximately $1.3 million in foreign currency translation, primarily related to the weakening of local currencies against the United States dollar.\nWood construction products represented 84% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018, flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Concrete construction products represented 16% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nOur fourth quarter consolidated gross profit decreased approximately 3% or $3.5 million to $98.4 million from $101.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a consolidated gross profit margin of 40.7%. As Karen highlighted, the year-over-year decline was primarily due to increased factory and overhead costs on lower production, higher material costs, including higher price steel, and higher labor costs resulting from tightening labor market condition.\nOn a per segment basis, our gross profit margin in North America was 42.3% compared to 46.2% in the prior-year quarter. In Europe, our fourth quarter gross profit margin was 31.7% compared to 34% in the year ago period. Our Europe gross margins were pressured by a year over decrease in concrete sales, which in Europe have higher margins than wood.\nFrom a product perspective, our fourth quarter gross profit margin on wood products was 41.3% compared to 43.8% in the prior year quarter, and was 31.4% for concrete products compared to 35.9% in the prior year quarter.\nNow turning to our fourth quarter costs and operating expenses. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cost structure, consolidated research and development and engineering expenses for the fourth quarter declined 19% year-over-year to $10.2 million, primarily due to decreased personnel costs and severance expenses.\nConsolidated selling expenses for the quarter decreased 9% year-over-year to $26.3 million, primarily due to decreases in personnel and advertising costs, which were partially offset by increases in sales commissions and depreciation expense. On a segment basis, compared to the prior year quarter, selling expenses in North America were flat and in Europe, they declined by 35%.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter increased 14% year-over-year to $41.3 million, primarily due to higher professional and consulting fees associated with the SAP project and management consultants, as well as increased IT-related costs. These were partly offset by decreases in severance expense and personnel costs.\nOn a segment level, general and administrative expenses in North America segment increased by $3 million compared to the prior-year quarter. In Europe, G&A increased by slightly less than $0.5 million year-over-year.\nWe remain committed to reducing our total operating expense dollars as a percentage of net sales. For the fourth quarter of 2018, total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales were 32%, down 130 basis points from the prior-year quarter.\nOur consolidated income from operations for the fourth quarter decreased 7% year-over-year to $22.7 million compared to $24.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In North America, income from operations decreased 14% year-over-year to $18.9 million. In Europe, loss from operations was $8.8 million compared to a loss of $3.3 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a $6.7 million goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the goodwill impairment, Europe's loss from operations would have been approximately $2.1 million.\nAs a result, our operating income margin of 9% on a consolidated basis declined by approximately 110 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. Our effective tax rate decreased to 28.7% from 45.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Our consolidated net income for the fourth quarter was $15.6 million or $0.34 per fully diluted share compared to net income of $13.1 million or $0.27 per fully diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Consolidated net income for the fourth quarter included the impact of $6.5 million after tax gain on the sale of real estate. Consolidated net income was also impacted by the aforementioned $6.7 million goodwill impairment charge in our Europe segment, which had no tax benefit.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. At December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $160.2 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to December 31, 2017. Our inventory levels as of December 31, 2018 were up by approximately $23 million compared to the same period last year, as we inventoried higher priced raw material compared to last year. We remained debt free with only a small portion of capital leases amounting to $3.4 million.\nAs a result of our strong sales and focus on working capital management, we generated approximately $160 million in cash flow from operations during 2018, an increase of nearly $41 million or 34% year-over-year. Capital expenditures were approximately $5.4 million for the quarter, which included $800,000 of capitalized costs related to the SAP project, compared to $12.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year 2018, capital expenditures were approximately $30 million, in line with our expectation.\nWe remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our cash flow from operations to our valued stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends on an annual basis. We paid approximately $39.9 million in cash dividends during 2018, including $10.1 million in the fourth quarter. Over the past three years, we have returned over 90% of our cash flow from operations to stockholders. On January 28, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share. The dividend will be payable on April 25, 2019 to the Company's shareholders of record as of April 4, 2019.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased 970,093 shares of our common stock at an average price of $62.93 per share, for a total of $61 million. In total, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased and received 1.77 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $62.69 per share for a total of $111.1 million. We also received a 182,000 shares of common stock as the final delivery of a $50 million share -- accelerated share repurchase program initiated in December 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had repurchased approximately $234.6 million in shares under our $275 million share repurchase authorization, which expired at the end of 2018.\nIn December, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a new $100 million share repurchase authorization, which will remain in effect through the end of 2019. Given our confidence in our business and our expectation that the 2020 plan will drive improved operational performance, we plan to continue to purchase additional shares of our stock.\nBefore we turn it over to questions, I'd like to discuss our 2019 outlook. For the full year of 2019, we are initiating guidance as follows: We expect our consolidated gross profit margin to be in the 44.5% to 45.5% range, given our expectation on housing starts. The effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27%, including both federal and state income taxes. Depreciation and amortization expense be in the range of $39 million to $41 million, of which $33 million to $35 million is pure depreciation and capital expenditures to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million, including approximately 25% of maintenance type CapEx.\nIn summary, we made meaningful progress in 2018, and I'd like to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication. We remain confident in the long-term value proposition of our business and look forward to updating our shareholders as we continue to execute against our strategic, operational and financial initiatives.\nThank you for your time and attention today. We'd now like to open up the call for questions. Operator?\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nTimothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\nGood afternoon, everybody.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nHi Tim.\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nHi Tim.\nTimothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\nI guess my first question, maybe just, could you elaborate just a little bit on what you're -- what you think a stable growth means. Just should we expect the rate to be kind of stable with Q4 levels, kind of stable with 2018 levels, I'm just trying to kind of understand how the volume cadence kind of played out through the quarter, and kind of what those volume numbers look like in January, more explicitly please?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Tim, I think we are still thinking that the housing starts are going to be in -- again low to mid-single-digits. We would, again continue to reiterate, when you look at our business is very cyclical, very common for fourth and first quarter to be lower volume numbers, and second and third quarter to be actually our largest numbers. So we had a December that was pretty low on a volume standpoint. As we've mentioned, we've seen it come back in January, not only from -- just the price increase, but also we have seen organic volume growth in January. So little early to tell what the year will look like, since we're in the first quarter and that's always a tough one depending on what weather conditions are, but we're anticipating again that mid-to-single-digit-growth on housing starts.\nTimothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\nOkay. And would you expect that to maybe be weighted toward -- more toward the second half, kind of Q2. I'm just trying to think through how you would expect that to kind of play out, because it actually may start a little down here in the first quarter?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I mean again, just based on weather conditions and what historically we have seen from our growth cycle, second and third quarter are always our largest periods of growth.\nTimothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\nOkay. And then, when we think about just kind of gross margins, and some of the modest improvement areas you're expecting through the year. Is there any sort of kind of cadence to kind of keep in mind on a quarterly basis. I mean, will your production levels be down at all, maybe in the first half. If you need the right size and sort of inventory or just trying to think of -- I know, the gross margins were a little stronger in the first half of the -- first three quarters of the year and obviously a little weaker in the fourth quarter. So just, how should we think about gross margins as we go through the year?\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nHi, Tim, it's Brian. I would expect that as we have greater selling activity in the -- to support customers for the busier building season. We absorb more overhead during those periods. So, of course, second and third quarter typically, traditionally are a little bit better and the gross margin, all things being equal than first or fourth. Again from factory absorption perspective, we've noted that it's a tight labor market and we're seeing that impact on our gross margin there, particularly in the fourth quarter, that was one of the elements there, but as we look at 2019, we would expect, second and third quarter to be a little bit better than first and fourth. Again, just from a volume perspective.\nTimothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\nOkay. And then, I know you kind of reiterated the SG&A target for the 2020 plan. Do you have anything kind of explicitly that you're targeting for SG&A, whether it's growth or as a percentage of sales for 2019 at all?\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nIt's Brian again. So, we would expect SG&A that -- all the elements of those to be approximately 27.5% to 28.5% of net revenues for 2019.\nTimothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\nOkay. So just kind of gliding toward that 26% to 27%. Okay. And then just the last question. Do you have any -- in the gross margin guidance, do you have any benefit from just kind of the moderation that we've seen in steel incorporated into that range?\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nNot necessarily. I mean, the way we're thinking about that is, as we mentioned in the third quarter, we -- due to availability, we increased our raw materials -- raw material and we'll need to sell through that. So, that guidance that we've given is estimating that. It will take us a while to work through current on hand raw material and then of course we'll be back in the market buying more throughout the course of the year. I'd say, it's a little early yet right now to specifically comment on your question there. But, how we are looking at 2019, and that gross margin range is taking into account. Now that growth that Karen had noted, in addition to our current on hand inventories.\nTimothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\nOkay. Okay, great. I'll hop back in queue. Good luck on '19.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Tim.\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nThanks, Tim.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Moore -- CJS Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\nGood afternoon, Karen. Good afternoon, Brian. Thanks for taking the question.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nGood afternoon.\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nGood afternoon.\nDaniel Moore -- CJS Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\nWanted to try to drill down a little bit and get a little bit more granularity on gross margin in Q4, specifically North America. If we look at the -- roughly 400 basis point decline year-over-year. Can you give -- is there any way to give a little bit more specifics in terms of impact of factory overhead and lower production and just absorption, number one. Number two, raw material, warehouse costs; number three, labor, if not to the basis point, maybe just kind of rank order, so we get a little bit better sense of those moving parts?\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nSure, Dan, this is Brian. I would say that the factory and tooling (ph), as a percent of revenue was the highest. So as we think about spend and absorption of that spend, so spend was up, and so -- with increased dollars and the volumes being what it was, that would have the biggest impact. I'd say material would be next. Again, as a percent of revenue, followed by direct labor and then our shipping and warehouse costs.\nDaniel Moore -- CJS Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\nGot it, very helpful. And this, maybe piggybacking on the last question. But, as we think about the guidance. Do you think it's reasonable to get back toward that lower end of your full year guidance range for Q1, or is that more of a ramp, as we get into the year given seasonality and maybe some of the weather related softness that you described?\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nDan, I would say that it a -- the year amount that we've -- the year estimate that we've put out there, we've not specifically broken out the individual quarters. But as I mentioned earlier, the first quarter's typically aren't going to be as good as -- the first quarter wouldn't be as good as Q2 or Q3. And then again, moderating on Q4. But we're looking at the annual for that range and haven't put out a Q1 gross margin guidance.\nDaniel Moore -- CJS Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\nGot it. And then lastly, the revenue drop that we -- that you experienced in December. Obviously, well documented kind of soft passion in anything housing related. But what have you heard from your customers in terms of explanations? Do you see them pulling back on inventory materially. Any sense for where they are in terms of the inventory levels, any kind of color around that would be great?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes, Dan, this is Karen. Tough for us to tell exactly from our customers on an inventory standpoint. And as you know, we can get products to our customers in 24 to 48 hour timeframe. So if they chose to pull back a little bit on inventory, they certainly know that we would be able to support them in January, and maybe that's a part of what we're seeing. But again, because we are not engaged in their inventory, it's real tough to get very precise on that.\nI think just a lot of the economic uncertainty that we saw, especially in the November-December timeframe. Seems like it impacted all the building industry and we were certainly a part of that also.\nDaniel Moore -- CJS Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks. Well, I'll jump back in queue, if I have any follow-ups. Thank you.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nThanks.\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nThanks, Dan.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Chercover -- D.A. Davidson & Co -- Analyst\nThank you. And forgive me, I was a little distracted on the call. But could you give us any geographic locations where the housing activity really fell off in Q4 or in December, as you said?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes, Steve that's interesting question. As you know, the housing starts are -- the numbers are not out because of government shutdown. So we still don't have the December housing numbers. So that's one thing that doesn't give us a good indication.\nThe other thing, I would just say, from the standpoint of what we're seeing in the weather, certainly in the Western states, we're having a pretty significant winter this year, and that definitely started somewhere in the November-December timeframe. So we don't have anything specific on it, and we'll have a little bit better information once that starts numbers come out. But it's really hard for us to really delineate anything specific in those regions. Again, we're kind of assuming what appears to be a normal fourth quarter, first quarter slowdown.\nSteven Chercover -- D.A. Davidson & Co -- Analyst\nBut to be fair, you don't really need the housing statistics from the government to know where you traditionally sell. So I mean did you see it in Florida, did you see it in California?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I mean again, as I mentioned, we saw what would be our normalized slowdown that we would see in that fourth quarter timeframe. And that's really a function of when weather hits.\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nYes, I would think -- Steve it's Brian. I would think that we should see some softness in the West housing starts and the South, based on internal figures that we have here. So, really interesting once those come out, see how the Census Bureau start correlate. But I would say that, should be again a West and South issue.\nSteven Chercover -- D.A. Davidson & Co -- Analyst\nOkay. And the 8% organic growth, that's embedded in your 2020 plan. Do you expect to see that this year or did the late 2018 powers (ph) give you concerns that might not materialize in FY '19, and I recognize you said things it's now back in January?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. As we look at our 2020 plan again that's a 8% compound annual growth rate, starting in 2016, and continuing through the end of 2020. We are tracking very nicely on that particular metric. Again as we've talked about, there's other elements that we're working on from that growth standpoint. The mechanical anchor line that we're looking to introduce in Home Depot, that's really tied to our housing start number. The work that we're doing in Europe to rollout our fastener line in Western Europe and then our connector line in the Nordics. So we have some elements, definitely about 8% CAGR that are not associated just with the housing start number.\nSteven Chercover -- D.A. Davidson & Co -- Analyst\nOkay. And then finally, since I'm not invited or I don't intend, but there's a big housing show, I believe in Las Vegas every year, I think it's coming up, and I'm just wondering if you have any new initiatives to propel the trust offering that will be more prominent this year than in years past?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So the Las Vegas show that's international builders show, that's coming up in --\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nTwo weeks.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nTwo weeks, I think in Los Vegas. That's not really the show where we showcase our Truss software, that happens at the component manufacturing show and that one's in October. At the builders show, again, we tend to showcase any new products that we have whether they're be in our fastener line, our carbon fiber or connectors, but that's not really a emphasis on the Truss software, that's again that was done in October. That was a very successful show that we just had in October with building components, Showed our product, our Truss offering, our software to significant number of component manufacturers, and are getting some good results of those that are interested in converting to our program in the next few months.\nSteven Chercover -- D.A. Davidson & Co -- Analyst\nOkay. And I guess, final question, forgive me. Love to see the repo, I think it's a great message to the -- to send the shareholders and a good discipline to return significant part of your excess cash. Has there been any thought given to inserting more nuance into how you actually do it. I mean, my bet there as your stock might be a bit weak tomorrow. Is it kind of on autopilot, or are you trying to get more dialed in as you come deeper into this initiative after several years?\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nSteve, it's Brian. So on that, I would say that, we've used a couple of mechanisms to do share repurchases. We used accelerated share repurchases, we've used 10b5-1 plans. Of course, those need to be initiated during open trading window periods. So yes, we'll be looking at trying to achieve that 50% return to shareholder goal, throughout the year, and we'll provide more updates as we get further along the year as it relates to the dividend. We've -- the Board typically looks at, well they discussed -- we discussed capital allocation throughout the year. But over the last few years, the Board as typically increased the annual -- the quarterly dividend on an annual basis at their April meeting. And we'll discuss that along with share repurchase levels. As we noted, there is $100 million authorization for 2019, and we'll see how that -- we'll see where those take us throughout the course of the year.\nSteven Chercover -- D.A. Davidson & Co -- Analyst\nBut just to clarify, the Board does have an intrinsic sense of the enterprise value or the --yes, I guess the enterprise value that is incorporated into the capital allocation decision?\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nCorrect.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes.\nSteven Chercover -- D.A. Davidson & Co -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you both.\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nThank you Steve.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nHey. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes.\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nHello Julio.\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nSo can you talk a little bit more on the European segment, and what caused those lower sales volumes. I think, I might have heard you mention there were elevated sales in the prior-year quarter. So if you can elaborate on that at all?\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nSure. So part of our European business, our concrete business over there has products, carbon fiber products for potentially large jobs. So asphalt paving products, runways and the like and that's some large jobs in Q4 of 2017 that we didn't have the same level in Q4 of '18. So not that the entire European businesses, this large job-based business, but there is a bit of that impact in our European concrete business related to larger projects that sales are recognized when those projects are are being conducted. So, sometimes there is a bit of a timing issue on a comparability.\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nOkay. And then just, I think we've spoken about this before, but just talk about again how building maybe above code -- resiliency can be a driver for you guys in the long-term. And how should we think about maybe best estimate for repair, remodel, as a percentage of sales?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I think we've talked about the codes. Again, there's one national code and you're required to design to that as a minimum standard. There recently, typically will put more content in a structure when it's on the West Coast or anywhere along the coastal areas is due to the earthquake, or at the high wind requirements. The codes are looking at potentially designing to something called resiliency versus life safety. And I think it was a really nice example of that, when Hurricane Michael hit Mexico Beach, and I think many people have seen this, one house left standing called the San Palace that was built to about a 50% higher than standard building code practices, basically was able to withstand a Category 5 Hurricane.\nSo a lot of interest about being able to build to resiliency versus like -- just to life safety, what would it cost, what would it create? When you think about code changed, I think that's a change in a positive direction because what you see is entire communities devastated. There are no houses, there are no schools, there are no jobs to come back to. So this concept of maybe changing those design standards is an interesting conversation that's occurring.\nAnd as I've mentioned, when you think about code changes, typically they take many, many years to enact. It is quite interesting that people are starting to talk about this and then they actually have a proof of concept in this house that survived that Category 5 Hurricane. So certainly it would be interesting, where we will stay on top of that, but that is not a near-term code change. My guess is 7 to 10 years out before someone would be willing to adopt those code changes.\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nHelpful. And just on repair and remodel, I mean, I think what would kind of be a fair range of -- what that would be as a percentage of sales?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes, we are -- as we've mentioned in the past, tough for us to give a specific number. We're certainly working on trying to get a better handle on that. And the real reason is, again the same products can be used in new construction as well as repair and remodel, and they go through the same distribution channel.\nObviously, we have some products like our outdoor accents (ph), that's really a repair remodel type of project. So we can track a few products, we can track a few types of distributors, but we're definitely working on getting a hand around better idea of how much of the business goes to repair and remodel. And as we brought the fastener line in I think that's been able to expand that opportunity and repair and remodel. So I don't have a specific number for you, but definitely, we are putting more products that go into decks and fences, and house editions, garage organizers, (inaudible) all those sorts of things.\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nOkay. Fair enough. Appreciate you taking the questions, and good luck in 2019.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nBrian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Secretary\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question is a follow-up from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Moore -- CJS Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\nThank you, again. And apologize, if this was asked in a different form previously. But -- just, Karen as it relates to your comments about January, as demand being described as strong. How does that dovetail with the expectation for kind of that low to mid-single-digit growth in housing starts for the year. In that level more the kind of stable flat, what have you seen so far during the quarter?\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. And again, it's always difficult to pick a quarter based on one month, but we definitely saw organic growth in January at a fairly decent pace. Will it continue? Hard to tell, again, February 4th or something here. But -- and it's also hard to know on that January was that some filling of warehouses. As we mentioned, that's real tough for us to see from our distributor standpoint, but definitely the January increases, not just based on the price increase. There is definitely organic growth in that January number.\nDaniel Moore -- CJS Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\nPerfect. Appreciate it again. Thank you.\nKaren Colonias -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nOkay.
