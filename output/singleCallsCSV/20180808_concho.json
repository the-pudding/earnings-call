At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone shall require operator assistance during the call, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Megan Hays. Ma'am you may begin.\nMegan Hays -- Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Affairs \nThank you. Good morning and welcome to Concho's second-quarter earnings call. I'm joined today in Midland by Tim Leach, Chairman and CEO, Jack Harper, President and CFO, and Will Giraud, Executive Vice President, as well as members of the Concho senior management team. Our earnings release and corporate presentation are both available on our website, and we plan to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q today after market close.\nPlease note that we will make forward-looking statements from current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial metrics. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP metrics, are in our earnings release and our corporate presentation. We have a lot of great news to discuss with you today. Tim will start the call, and then you will hear from Jack. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Tim.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Megan. Good morning. With nearly half the drilling rigs and completion crews in the country running in the Permian Basin, the region is as busy as we've ever seen. We estimate that more than $50 billion in capital invested will complete wells in the Permian in 2018. Industry's capital investments headed even higher when you add up midstream, refining, and other services. It's an environment like this where our scale, experience, and being right in the middle of the action helps us deliver.\nSecond quarter was another strong quarter; we achieved record production of 229,000 BOEs per day with oil production up 26% compared to a year ago. Our performance this quarter wasn't driven by any one asset; rather, it was the outcome of strong results from large-scale development across the entire portfolio. Even with the busy environment, the team has done good work fighting inflationary trends by getting more efficient and increasing our use of Permian sand.\nWe talked about reaching inflection points in the past; the shift to horizontal development in 2011 is one example. Establishing a position in the Northern Delaware is another, and it was about a year ago that we described another inflection point, our progression to large-scale development. Horizontal drilling and the Northern Delaware turned out to be huge value drivers for the company, and we believe manufacturing mode will do the same thing.\nThis transition has been one of our most important operational and strategic priorities, and we're early in realizing the positive impacts to capital efficiency, returns, and recoveries that we believe large-scale development will deliver. The RSP acquisition solidifies our scale advantage and reinforces our growth platform for bigger wells and increasing returns. With the transaction now complete, our most important phase of work begins -- realizing the benefits of this powerful combination by successfully integrating our teams and operations.\nYou've heard me say before that our people are our greatest asset, and with RSP, our team grows even stronger. I welcome the 171 RSP employees to the Concho team. The RSP assets enhance some of the best parts of our portfolio with exceptional development potential. We started on unlocking that potential on day one by directing capital to several projects on the RSP assets. Following the closing, we're running 32 horizontal rigs, which is the largest program in the Permian. And eight of those rigs are running on former RSP assets.\nJack will cover the development plans for the second half of the year in more detail. The key takeaway is, we're taking premium resource and making it more valuable with our operational machine.\nSo far, 2018 has been unprecedented in terms of the transformative actions we've taken and the solid results we've delivered. In the first half of the year, we organically added 18,000 BOEs per day of production, generated about $150 million in free cash flow, executed several trades to block up core acreage, sold noncore leasehold, and announced the RSP acquisition. The acquisition combines two great companies focused on the highest-quality resource in the Permian Basin, has scale and expertise necessary to compete globally. As we move forward, I'm even more optimistic and energized about the outlook for the company. We have distinct competitive advantages, execution strength, the depth of our quality resource, capital efficiency, financial strength. And RSP reinforces each of these and enhances our ability to drive sustainable growth and returns for our shareholders. Jack will now discuss the quarter in more detail and provide an update on our outlook for the year.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nThank you, Tim, and good morning. Our strategy and execution translates to strong operational and financial performance. Production for the quarter totaled 229,000 BOEs per day, which was in line with the high end of our guidance. Oil production averaged 143,000 barrels per day at 26% increase compared to the prior year and flat versus the first quarter of '18. At this point, we're right where we expected to be. Over the past 12 months, U.S. oil production has grown considerably, and the engine behind this growth was the Permian Basin. The EIA estimates that the Permian has added an average 75,000 barrels per day each month so far in '18, with August production expected to be a record 3.4 million barrels per day. This growth is showing up faster than forecasted, and while new long-haul pipe projects are being built, these new projects are slated to come online with little margin for delay.\nAs we described last quarter, our midstream strategy has evolved significantly over the past decade. We've made strategic investments in infrastructure that are intended to protect our upstream business by ensuring operational continuity. Approximately 90% of our oil is gathered and transported by pipe, most of which is covered by firm sales agreements, with the remaining 10% directed to regional refineries. Our marketing strategy has always prioritized the highest wellhead price while maximizing flexibility. As crude takeaway gets tight, we are leveraging our size and scale to secure flow assurance today. Importantly, our firm sales agreements provide near-term flow assurance without limiting long-term pricing flexibility. And just as we mitigate flow assurance risk through firm sales agreements, we also mitigate the financial risk of the Midland Cushing differential with basis hedges.\nOn the other side of margin equation, our controllable cash costs look good. Cash G&A was stable when compared to the first quarter of the year, while both LOE and interest expense decreased. In the second quarter, adjusted net income per share was $1.24, and we generated $592 million of EBITDA. When oil prices moved lower in late '14, we moved quickly to align capital spending with cash flow from operations, and we've done that for 11 out of the past 12 quarters. In fact, over that time period, we've generated more than $600 million in free cash flow. In the earnings material, we only show operating cash flow and D&C capital for the past two years, which is also impressive. We've increased production 50% and generated approximately $250 million in free cash over that period. I believe that stacks up well against our peers, and I can't think of a better illustration of the commitment we have to capital discipline and of the quality of our assets.\nTurning now to the balance sheet, maintaining a strong financial position enables us to deliver near-term results, invest for the long term, and better manage risk. Following the RSP transaction, we maintained a strong balance sheet, which was acknowledged by the upgrade to BBB minus by Moody and BBB flat by Fitch. We now have investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. We recently completed a $1.6 billion senior notes offering consisting of both 10-year and 30-year tranches at a blended rate of 4.5%. The proceeds were used to redeem RSP senior notes for $1.2 billion and repay a portion of the outstanding balance under their credit facility. These transactions achieve a key cost-savings target by reducing pro forma annual interest expense by more than $15 million. After giving effect to the liability management actions and associated transaction cost, we would have had long-term debt of $4.2 billion at June 30.\nImportantly, our leverage ratio remains below 1.5 times. We're proud of the RSP acquisition and the entire position we've carefully and strategically built in the Permian over the last decade. As a result of closing the transaction, we've updated our guidance for production and capital to include RSP beginning on closing date of July 19.\nOverall RSP reported production volumes on a three-stream basis, we will continue to report on a two-stream basis and have converted RSP's volumes to two-stream, which resulted in an approximate 10% reduction in their equivalent volumes, but has no impact to cash flow. For the third quarter, we expect production to average 280,000 to 285,000 BOEs per day, with RSP contributing to production beginning on July 19. The fourth quarter will be our first full quarter with RSP, and we expect production will leverage 305,000 to 310,000 BOEs per day. For both third and fourth quarters, we're guiding to an oil mix of 65%.\nFor full-year 2018, we expect reported production to average about 260,000 BOEs per day consisting of 64% oil. To help calibrate models, on slide 12 in the earnings presentation, we provided pro forma production on a two-stream basis for full-year '17 through the second quarter of '18. On a pro forma basis, the new full-year '18 guidance equates to approximately 21% to 23% production growth year over year. Moving RSP's premium assets to development mode is the most efficient way to build value in the combined company. Post-transaction operations and integration activities are going well, and in the second half of the year we plan to jump-start large-scale projects on RSP's assets.\nIn the Northern Delaware we have one planned project, the Taylor. In the Midland Basin, RSP recently achieved solid results in Glasscock County. We plan to continue the success with the six-well project there. We also plan to develop a five-well project on Spanish Trail lease in Midland County and a 13-well project in Martin County. We're also completing several infrastructure projects that facilitate large-scale development in the Northern Delaware on RSP's assets. All of this activity is reflected in our updated capital outlook of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.\nThere are two points I want to emphasize. First, there is no change to our investment philosophy. We expect operating cash flow to fully fund the capital program, which will be allocated based on rate of return. Our production growth is the output of this investment framework. And second, the RSP transaction enhances the capital efficiency of Concho as we built the final new E&P business model. We continue to believe that leadership in our industry is defined by execution strength and capital discipline. I hope you've come to expect Concho to deliver on these principles. We're well-positioned to leverage the power of our portfolio and the strength of our team to extend our track record of profitable growth and returns. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nThe Permian Basin Is Turning Into an ATM for Oil Stock Investors\n\n\nConcho Resources Inc (CXO) Q1 2019 Earnings Call Transcript\n\n\nAfter 2 Huge Investment Windfalls, This Permian Basin Driller Is Going for the Trifecta\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press the star key and then the No. 1 key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to terminate yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. Our first question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJohn Freeman -- Raymond James -- Analyst \nGood morning, guys.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer \nGood morning, John.\nJohn Freeman -- Raymond James -- Analyst \nWhen I look at slide 13, clearly you guys are hitting the ground running immediately on the RSP acres of these large-scale projects. I know that stand-alone Concho had about two-thirds of its activity that was focused on these large-scale projects. And ballpark, it looks like on second half of '18, over half of the activity in the RSP acreage is devoted to these larger-scale projects. And I'm just trying to get a sense and just from a high-level, rough estimate of the projects that are detailed on slide 13, just a ballpark rough idea of what percentage of those wells or projects don't come online until either -- call it second half 4Q or into '19.\nWill Giraud -- Executive Vice President \nYeah, hey John. This is Will. All of those will come on later in 2019.\nJohn Freeman -- Raymond James -- Analyst \nPerfect. Then, when I'm looking at the various sizes of the projects, anywhere from five-well pads to 20-well pads. You all do mention in the slides, for example, on the Dominator pad, you all had to basically coordinate,over a year in advance with the midstream partners with that project. I'm just curious how much the midstream component has an impact on the size of these pads? Then, longer-term if we should sort of think that these projects are likely going to gravitate toward the larger end of that range over time.\nWill Giraud -- Executive Vice President \nSure. Midstream is certainly one of the elements that goes into sizing it, but I would say that the bigger driver is -- let me step back for a minute. I think we've been one of the leaders in moving to these larger-scale development projects, and that's been a steady evolution over the last couple of years as we've tested different spacing within a zone and between zones. So, these bigger and bigger projects I think are just the further evolution of that trend.\nWhere you see some of the smaller projects, that's us continuing to test tighter spacing or different spacing within a zone or between zones again. So, I think you're right, longer-term, you'll see an evolution to the bigger and bigger projects. However, we're still learning as we go, and so I think you'll see a blend of different sizes.\nJohn Freeman -- Raymond James -- Analyst \nThanks, I appreciate. Nice quarter.\nWill Giraud -- Executive Vice President \nThank you.\nTim Leach -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is now open.\nBob Morris -- Citi -- Analyst \nGood morning. Congratulations, Tim and Jack, in getting the RSPs completed in the fall here. Looking at the rate count that you've ramped up to combine for the two companies at 32. You've added about five since the deal was announced, and four of those five are on the Concho properties, which at 24 rigs is a little bit higher paced than what you'd originally planned for the year. Could you just talk a little bit about the acceleration now on legacy Concho assets and why you're seeing more acceleration there at this stage as opposed to RSP deals, and just overall the acceleration activity if that's driven by oil prices with just the better positioning of the combined companies?\nWill Giraud -- Executive Vice President \nSure. Will again. I'd say that what we're doing on the Concho properties is consistent with what our plan has been for the year. We did add those rigs here over the last month or two, but we've also added a rig to the RSP properties. At this point, it really just reflects what the two companies were doing on a stand-alone basis. I think, you're starting to see it now that we've closed, and over the course of this year you'll continue to see us I think put our stamp on those properties. But I wouldn't really characterize that as anything different than what you should have expected earlier in the year.\nBob Morris -- Citi -- Analyst \nOkay. Right. Then my second question is, on the Northern Delaware Basin, the Columbus four-well pad, the 30-day IPs were sharply above what we've seen in the Delaware Basin, historically. Can you just talk a little bit about where you are in the completion optimization process, as far as that contributing to the much better results there at Columbus versus what is just location or acreage there as being better than what we've seen in other areas in your portfolio?\nWill Giraud-- Executive Vice President \nYeah. I mean we're drilling really good Wolfcamp wells, and I think that Columbus project is an example of that. I think we're getting better and better at targeting and also continuing to refine our completion. So, I think it just reflects a good area and also good work by the team by drilling really good wells.\nBob Morris -- Citi -- Analyst \nGreat. Thank you and congratulations again.\nWill Giraud -- Executive Vice President \nThank you.\nJack Harper -- President, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBrian Singer -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst \nThank you. Good morning.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer \nGood morning, Brian.\nBrian Singer -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst \nShifting to the firm sales agreements and the realized pricing side of the equation, can you add a bit more specifics on those firm sales agreements, particularly how they provide a long-term pricing optionality as you described. And then whether the agreements provide the flow assurance for the 90% of the crude that your gathering systems are moving, the full 100% when including the piece you'll sell regionally or some other percentage.\nWill Giraud -- Executive Vice President \nYeah Brian. Let me first say that, when I think about the issue of crude oil leaving the Permian Basin, it seems like there's two issues. One is, can you move your crude oil, and secondly, what price you get paid for it. I think as we've described, we have firm sales agreements that cover our crude oil in such a way that we have a high confidence level that our crude will move, And, on the pricing side, that we've used hedges the way we've historically used hedges for the differentials, as a shock absorber that covers most of our exposure for this year and next year. So I feel good about our position, I don't think that transportation is going to affect any of our plans. In fact, you even can see by the way we're ramping up that we have confidence that we're going be able to expand going into next year. But I'll turn it to Jack to talk about any specifics he wants to talk about.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nYeah Brian, I would add to that, that the flexibility we're talking about in '20 is just a reflection of how we attempt to style these agreements, which give that opportunity at a later date. And if history repeats itself when you get through this period of tightness and Midland pricing becomes at parity again, you have a lot more options at that point than you do today.\nBrian Singer -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst \nGreat. Thanks, and I guess to tie that into the production trajectory, and I think this was covered a little bit earlier by virtue of increasing the scale with the longer-lead-time projects on slide 13. You would seem to have a lot more visibility on the cadence of wells being brought to sales, not just in the next few quarters, but potentially for the first three-plus quarters of 2019. Is it fair to say that the second quarter and the third quarter of '19 are when a lot of these new projects are going to come online? And to your point, just now, for many that's when Permian oversupply may very well be added at its worst?\nJack Harper -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nThat's a fair assessment, Brian, and that does line up with the timing of a lot of these larger-scale projects. So, that is correct and it's also just in line with how we were planning to go about our business, anyway. So it's nice that it lines up that way.\nBrian Singer -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst \nThanks, and are you still taking efforts to expose the company to post to pricing points beyond Midland and your hedges Cushing? And is that something that could have an impact on 2019, or is that longer-term?\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nAlways longer term, and I think you could see that optionality and price began in late 19 early 20. I feel very confident that we will have opportunities to look at it more as a portfolio approach if we choose to do that. However, we do think Midland will be a good place to price a barrel longer term due to the options that we have here.\nBrian Singer -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst \nThank you.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Doug Leggate, with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst \nThanks everybody. Good morning. Tim, I kind of feel that I ask you this question every quarter, but for the combined company, you're well on a stand-alone basis in Q2. You generated free cash flow, and the combined company in this commodity deck, it looks like that might continue even at a higher activity level. How should we think about your prior comments about spending cash flow, and I think a couple of quarters ago, you talked about when you do something it will be significant as it relates to surplus cash whether it be dividend or buyback or something, but can you just frame your thoughts if post the Permian bottlenecks. Oil prices I assume holdup at this new trading range we've seen recently.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer \nYeah. Well, I think one of the the most important things to start with, is that these capital programs we put together are the highest rate of return capital-efficient programs we've ever had in the company's history. So, a lot of our cash flow goes back into those programs because it creates so much value. I would say over the longer term though, and going into the next year or two, oil prices have been very volatile.\nWe've been pretty conservative on how we build our capital program and what commodity price we look at for that program to break even. I like the notion of generating free cash flow and growing dramatically, and so, I think in the short term, you're going to see us generating free cash flow and growing dramatically and then beyond 2020.\nI think as we've discussed in the past, we have all the options in front of us on what's the best way to create value for our shareholders, what's the optimal rate to run our machine, and I think we're just going to be really well-positioned.\nDoug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst \nI know it's a not an easy one to answer, but I guess we have to wait a couple of years. My follow-up if I may and this too we goes to my discussion with Megan last night. I realized that do not [inaudible] normalized, but you really can do a whole heck of a lot with RSP prior to the close. So, now that you've got a hold of this thing, you haven't given us updated that works for 19 and 20 the way you did for Concho.\nI'm just wondering if I could pressure you a little bit to give us some ideas of maybe how you see the pro forma company growth profile over the next couple of years referencing the guidance you used to give us for Concho. I know, I realized this a little early, but any help would be appreciated, now we go there. Thanks.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nWell, I think as Jack said, our philosophies haven't changed on how we run the business and RSP, that acquisition brings in very high-quality properties. So, one of the ways we create value is by aggressively managing our portfolio of assets.\nYou'll see that continue and then as we look at our capital budget and allocate capital, you're going to see capital going to the highest rate of return projects, which is Jack's described in this presentation are bigger and bigger percentages of multi-well pads, and those kind of projects, lots of those will be on RSP. So, as far as when we give guidance for 2019, historically, we've transitioned to giving guidance.\nAfter the year has been completed, I think we just got our hands on the steering wheel on the RSP assets, but we've already started to reallocate capital and the earliest I think you could see us give you any guidance would be probably at the end of next quarter.\nDoug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst \nSo Tim, just to be clear, are you pointing toward an acceleration in asset sales?\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nI think an acceleration would be a mischaracterization. I just think it's an ongoing aggressive portfolio management to high-grade our portfolio. We've got great assets across both basins, but we will continue to very aggressively manage those to block up high-grade and you ought to see our map getting more concentrated overtime.\nDoug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst \nI'll thank you, gracias. Thanks a lot fellas, I appreciate it.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nAll right. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nMike Kelly -- Seaport Global -- Analyst \nHey, guys. Good morning.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nGood morning.\nMike Kelly -- Seaport Global -- Analyst \nI really just wanted to get your take at a high level of how you see the dynamics playing out in the permeant over the next six or 12 months. Jack mentioned in his prepared remarks that production has really exceeded expectations. As we near pipeline capacity, just really curious on how you see the potential for differentials to vary. What dynamics you could see ultimately happen to producers' certain behavior, etc. Just really your high-level thoughts. Thanks.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nOkay, well, let me start with the high-level thoughts on, you know what? We have not had any problem moving offshore in our crude oil. Historically, we've seen situations like this before where it was just two years ago that everyone was asking about access to service and supply and they came along big time for us.\nSo, the Permian is a great place to be, transportation resources out of the Permian will supply all of the needs that the industry has, and I think that my expectation is from very high level that when there is a need and there's economic's involved that our industry is great at responding to that need. So, I think that we've seen these blowouts in differential before, that's why we have this type of hedging program we have. I think this problem will be solved more quickly than anybody's estimating and then will be onto the next problem.\nMike Kelly -- Seaport Global -- Analyst \nFair enough. I guess you do have great basis swaps protected there, how about the activity levels for you guys? If differentials really do get to excessive, egregious levels, do you think about slowing activity or how do you respond to that?\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nMike, cash flow is the ultimate governor of our business and we're also prudent in the way we go about our business. So, if you did have some period of dislocation that brought down the cash flow, we would match up our activity over time with that.\nMike Kelly -- Seaport Global -- Analyst \nGot it, appreciate. Thanks.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nThanks.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Airline Development.\nMichael Hall -- Heikkinen Energy -- Analyst \nThanks. Good morning.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nGood morning.\nMichael Hall -- Heikkinen Energy -- Analyst \nI wanted to talk a little bit I guess about the 2018, the back-half guys on a proforma basis. I guess as we kind of combine the two, we had a bit higher fourth quarter number in particular relative to what you all had. You talked in the deck about kind of project timing on legacy assets and shifting to manufacturing on the RSP assets. Just wondering how much that impacted I guess the fourth quarter number relative to what it maybe would have been on just kind of go forward RSP in terms of the way they had been managing that business. How quickly do we make that up? Should we expect to see a big uptick in the first quarter '19 or how does that transition to manufacturing? How long does that have to take to play out I guess? Big questions sir I appreciate it.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nYeah. Let me start by saying that both companies are doing well relative to our plan and relative to our internal focus, both look favorable to those. In most certainly, jump-starting the activity on large projects in RSP modestly defers the timing of some production, but really nothing materially different than what they had planned on those assets or what we had planned on ours. So, but it should provide us some nice momentum as we look to build the budget for next year.\nMichael Hall -- Heikkinen Energy -- Analyst \nOkay. Is it fair to think then we'd see a pretty healthy uptick early in '19 just as that curves. Is there likely that there's a big lump early in 2019?\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nYes. Tim mentioned we're just now getting our arms around the edges. You see some actions we're taking here in the near term which is building out infrastructure, starting on some of these larger projects on the newly acquired assets, and the earliest we would really guide, as Tim mentioned, would be next quarter, but we're excited most importantly about the added efficiency. This allows us to build a program with this new set of assets.\nMichael Hall -- Heikkinen Energy -- Analyst \nOkay, makes sense. I guess last thing. Do you have an estimated base decline for the just combined base point, like what a 12-month out decline rate might look like?\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer, \nAll combined, they're similar to what our was prior.\nMichael Hall -- Heikkinen Energy -- Analyst \nIs that like a low 30% is that a reasonable level?\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer, \nYeah. It's a little bit lower than that, it depends on the timing and cadence of these projects, but yes somewhere in that plus or minus 30 is a good way to think about it.\nMichael Hall -- Heikkinen Energy -- Analyst \nOkay. Appreciate that. Congrats guys.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nNeal Dingmann -- SunTrust -- Analyst \nMorning all. Tim, for you or Jack I'm just wondering, obviously your Oryx investment continues to pay dividends with the 24% membership interest, what was it, I think the last quarter you received, what? Almost 160 million distribution there, I'm just wondering how should we think about that either remainder of this year or go forward, what else that can generate or what else we should think about around that position.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nThat Oryx asset is a great asset. We were very happy that we were able to participate in that. It's, as we described in the prepared remarks, it's helping us move that Delaware Basin oil via pipeline. So, and it's a real business generating real cash flow. So, we're happy with it as is or if there's a monetization opportunity in the future, that'd be fine too but most importantly, it's serving the purpose that we hoped it would, which is helping us move our barrels to better markets and better prices.\nNeal Dingmann -- SunTrust -- Analyst \nJack are there more opportunities like this to invest in, that you think you will see?\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nThere are more midstream opportunities. We try to stay true to our E&P business routes and really you would most likely see us only investing in those kind of projects that our equity volumes could support some large portion of the investment.\nNeal Dingmann -- SunTrust -- Analyst \nOkay. Then just one last quick one maybe Tim you mentioned. Next see the ramp in rigs, just wondering with the efficiencies, you continue to see both on the drilling and completion side? How do you think about sort of what's needed on the frac side if you're running 3200 rigs? I mean it seems like it's nice tug-of-war to see, you see a little more efficiencies drilling and you see more efficiencies in the fracs. How should we think about that on a go-forward?\nTim Leach -- Concho ResourcesInc \nWe're running thin spreads today and that seems to be adequate with the number of rigs we're running. So, we're happy with the balance in the business right now.\nNeal Dingmann -- SunTrust -- Analyst \nVery good. Thank you all.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nMorning to Tim, Jack and to the rest of the team there.\nTim Leach -- Concho ResourcesInc \nMorning.\nCharles Meade -- Johnson Rice -- Analyst \nI want to go back to the question you've had from a few questioners ago on the 4Q guidance. I appreciate the disclosure you guys put on on Slide 12 on your presentation. But to put some numbers to it, it looks like the kind of consensus on the street for 4Q was maybe 3% or so higher than what you guys are guiding to for 4Q.\nBecause one possible explanation for that is that people in seats like mine maybe had some difficulty deal going from three stream to two stream. But the other possibility that is out there to me, is that perhaps you guys are pulling in your horns a little bit in 4Q in response to the differential situation in your desire to kind of continued spending within cash flow.\nSo, is there any aspect of that in 4Q that you guys are dialing back a bit in anticipation of low cash flow or are you on the same course as you said earlier?\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nWe really have not had any significant change to our plans. The modest change to our SDs plan is more investment in the back half of the year on starting these large-scale projects, both in infrastructure and in the size of the projects. But really, as I mentioned before, both companies are tracking well with the previous plan and the guidance that was laid out there last quarter.\nCharles Meade -- Johnson Rice -- Analyst \nGot it. Thank you for that Jack. Then in a totally different direction, there's some news reports, or there are news reports yesterday and again more this morning about a pipeline fire to the Southeast town where you guys are. I'm just curious if you guys could offer any insight into whether you were affected by any of the flows on those lines and if there's any bigger industry effect if you guys are aware of right now or might anticipate.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nWe are aware of that situation and don't anticipate any impact to our plans.\nCharles Meade -- Johnson Rice -- Analyst \nThank you.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nThank you.\nOperator\nNext question comes from Michael McAllister with MUFG Securities, your line is now open.\nMichael McAllister -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst \nGood morning, everyone. I was hoping that you could give me at least the metrics that could work with, grow dramatically within cash flow. Is it production, resource, reserves?\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nI'm not sure I really understand your question. When I talk about growing dramatically within cash flow, I'm talking about growing production within our cash flow and generating free cash flow while we're doing that.\nMichael McAllister -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst \nThat's the answer. Okay, so it's production is the metric.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nWe talked about a three-year CGAR that is supported within cash flow at much lower oil prices and we gave a point in time reference to that last quarter, so that's only been enhanced by this transaction.\nMichael McAllister -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst \nOkay, that's what I was looking for, that's the answer. While I have you, can you give me an update on Eddy County. What's been going on there? Will it have a development program at some point? Things kind of shift a little with RSP, any color on that would be helpful.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nSure, you're asking about what would have plan to do at Eddy County. I mean, it's clearly part of our Northern Delaware asset. We and other participants have been doing a lot of good work out there and the different Bone Spring intervals. We talked about a couple of wells there last quarter. But, also people are drilling a bunch the different Wolfcamp zones and it has been part of the plan and will continue to be.\nMichael McAllister -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst \nOkay that's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator\nNext question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nArun Jayaram -- J.P.Morgan -- Analyst \nGood morning. I was wondering if you could just give us more details on the conversion from three-stream to two-stream and just the impact to RSPP volumes in the second half of the year.\nMichael McAllister -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst \nSure, Arun. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's about a 10% impact to their equivalent volumes and that is starting on July 19th, that is how we have forecasted those volumes combined with ours.\nArun Jayaram -- J.P.Morgan -- Analyst \nGreat. Thanks for that. Just secondly, Jack, you've gone to 32 rigs and now 10 frac throughs. Just your thoughts on maintaining that level of activity as we move in to 2019 and just wondering if also if you could comment broadly in 2018, the growth rate is 22% on a pro forma basis, how the RSP assets would look like relative to that growth rate when you put that together, 2019 and 2020.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nOkay. If I understand that correctly, let me take a shot at that. We had put our guidance of 18% to 20% stand-alone, so incrementally moving above that is what you're seeing the benefit of their assets, and previous to this deal, we had talked about our plan, which reinvested cash flow and grew about 20%. They had talked about reinvesting their cash flow over a longer period of time and growing about 30%.\nSo, that's a good indication of the two asset basis. But now that we have the opportunity to put them together, and based the programs on the best rate of return from either set of assets, I think that's very powerful and they bring a lot of cash flow to the table as well.\nArun Jayaram -- J.P.Morgan -- Analyst \nGreat, thanks a lot. Thank you.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel Financial your line is now open.\nDerrick Whitfield -- Stifel Financial -- Analyst \nGood morning all.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nGood morning.\nDerrick Whitfield -- Stifel Financial -- Analyst \nTim or Jack, so referencing slide 13, what percentage of your aggregate completions are large-scale development projects? Then how should we think generally about the cadence to completions over the next year, assuming relatively static rig activity levels?\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nSo, more than half of the completions that will happen will be on these large-scale projects and that's only going to continue to increase over time. I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?\nDerrick Whitfield -- Stifel Financial -- Analyst \nSure. The second part of the question is, how should we generally think about the cadence of completions quarter-over-quarter if we assume static rig activity levels from here?\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nSure. We're ramping into the fourth quarter, you will see progressively increasing completions throughout the back half of this year.\nDerrick Whitfield -- Stifel Financial -- Analyst \nOkay. As my follow-up question, regarding the dominator pilot and Northern Delaware. How should we think about the sequencing of drilling completion and flow-back operations for larger pilots like it, and specifically when would we see first production, and then how much later will it then peak?\nWill Duro -- Executive Vice President \nSure. This is Will. The goal there is to complete those wells simultaneously with multiple frac spreads and then fold them back together and that's probably a mid to late next year timing.\nDerrick Whitfield -- Stifel Financial -- Analyst \nGot it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nWill Duro -- Executive Vice President \nThank you.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nThanks Derrick.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One. Your line is now open.\nRichard Tullis -- Capital One -- Analyst \nThanks. Good morning everyone. Jack and Tim, two quick questions. So, now that the RSP acquisition is closed, I know it's still early days, but could you talk a little bit about your current outlook for achieving the two billion-plus in synergies from the deal? Do you expect us to see significant synergies once you do publish your 2019 budget.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nSure. There's a lot of value creation opportunities with that deal that we've described. I'd point you toward the corporate and interest savings which we've already achieved that gets you approximately a quarter of that larger number. Then you can see by evidence of our activity in the back half of the year we've jump-started these large-scale projects which we think is the biggest driver. We're also spending money on the infrastructure to support those and then outside of that, we've identified a large number of trade that we're actively working and we continue to actively manage our portfolio via asset sales and purchases of acreage in and around some of our best area. So, I would say we're ahead of schedule there and optimistic.\nRichard Tullis -- Capital One -- Analyst \nOkay Jack. If you had to roughly estimate the impact on the updated 2018 budget from the synergies, what would you put that number at?\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nWell, I guess it depends on how and who's calculating that, but as I said the corporate and interest savings have been achieved now and by virtue of starting these large projects in the back half of the year, we will begin to see the fruits of those investments into next year.\nRichard Tullis -- Capital One -- Analyst \nOkay. All right. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nJack Harper -- President and Chief Financial Officer \nSure.\nOperator\nAt this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Tim Leach, CEO for closing remarks.\nTim Leach -- Chairman and Chief Financial Officer \nThank you again for dialing into the call. This is an exciting time for us as we've described. I want to complement our team on excellent execution on getting this deal closed and again, I want to welcome those RSP employees to the Concho team. So, thank you very much. We look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. Thanks.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference.
