Mr. Sha, please.\nYunlong Sha -- Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\nHello, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. 2018 was a challenging year for China's education industry with the announcement of several new government regulations designed to standardize and enhance compliance of the after-school education institutions.\nAs a public company, we strongly support the government's reform measures and proactively began implementing a series of internal measures to ensure our schools' compliance with the new regulations.\nWhile China's macroeconomic environment softened during the quarter, we were still able to generate solid topline growth during the fourth quarter. Net revenues for the quarter grew to more than 530 million RMB, an increase of 24.2% year over year and at the high end of our guidance range of 20% to 25%.\nWe strategically slowed the pace of acquisitions as a result of the new regulations. But despite this, revenue continued to gain growth momentum on the back of strong organic growth in student enrollments, which grew 45% year over year.\nWe believe this demonstrates our strong operational capabilities and the enormous organic growth potential our existing schools have. For example, our utilization rate for the quarter increased to 78.7% from 70.6% during the same period of 2017, a significant improvement resulting from the continuous optimization of resource utilization efficiency.\nIn addition, our retention rate increased further from the high levels we saw last year, driven in part by organic growth across our network, which serves as a cornerstone for our long-term sustainable growth.\nWe continued to acquire schools during the quarter despite the strategic slowdown in the pace of our acquisitions early last year prior to the IPO and the impact from new regulations. We acquired Jinan Boys School and Tiancai School during the second half of the year after thorough due diligence on their compliance with the regulations.\nTiancai School in particular, which we acquired during the fourth quarter, has a strong market presence in Jinan, Shandong Province, and will create synergies with our other K-12 schools in that city. Our acquisition strategy in 2019 remains the same and will continue to serve as one aspect of our growth strategy.\nOur net loss margin during the quarter continued to narrow with non-GAAP net loss margin improving by 490 basis points from a year ago, which we believe shows the effectiveness of our Puxin Business System in generating growth across our school network. We will continue to implement our strategy to improve topline growth from acquired schools as we work to further narrow our loss.\nIn October 2018, we established a business unit fully devoted to developing online education products and strategies to acquire and retain users. At the same time, we're also developing a unique set of strategies to combine and leverage the synergies that will be created between our online and offline businesses. We will continue to increase our investment into the development of our online education business as part of our overall strategy throughout the year.\nNow, one more important update I'd like to share with you. In February 2019, we appointed a new independent director. We are honored to have Mr. Wang Neng join our board of directors. Dr. Wang serves as Chong Khoon Lin Professor of Real Estate and Finance at Columbia Business School. He is also the Honorary Dean and Academic Director of the School of Finance at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a member of the Lohan Academy. He is also the recipient of the Thousand Talents Program, one of the most prestigious awards granted by the Chinese government.\nDr. Wang's research interests include consumption finance, corporate finance, entrepreneurship finance, macroeconomics, international finance, asset pricing theory, and finance science and technology. His strong academic background in finance will play a significant role in helping us formulate a financial strategy for future acquisitions.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Peng, who will go over the financials.
