(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Richard Geronimo, who is a Private Investor.Richard Geronimo -- Private Investor -- AnalystYeah. Hello. Good morning. How are you, guys? Hello?Brian Chen -- General Manager, Capital Markets DepartmentGood morning. Thank you.Richard Geronimo -- Private Investor -- AnalystGood morning. Okay. I have a couple questions. Do you guys -- clearly, the company is doing quite well. Do you guys have any thoughts about coming to the US, United States and trying to pick up some analysts to follow the company.Brian Chen -- General Manager, Capital Markets DepartmentYes. This is Brian Chen again. The General Manager of Capital Market department. It is actually really my role. After this call in a months or so, we do plan to organize a tour to US to interact with our analysts and investors to talk about face-to-face and have a more in-depth conversation.Richard Geronimo -- Private Investor -- AnalystOkay. So, have you -- obviously, you started the groundwork for it. Do you have some analysts from some major companies that are interested in following Xinyuan?Brian Chen -- General Manager, Capital Markets DepartmentAt this moment, I'm not aware. As far as I know, Xinyuan is pretty much the only one real estate developer that originated from China but listed in the New York Stock Exchange. Looks like we don't have a lot of coverage. That is one other area that we will try to improve by doing some -- a tour, some of the conversation on the ground. And we are going to enhance our Investor Relationship function, taking in more questions and have more conversation about the company's current status and the future plans.Richard Geronimo -- Private Investor -- AnalystOkay. And with the refinancing up to the 14.2% coupon, so you're still giving guidance of revenue of 10% increase and including the increased coupon rate and also an increase of the income of 15% to 20%.Xuefeng Li -- Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah. That is still the plan for the year. For the contracted sales, our plan is to have a 10% increase and the proceeds (ph) had 10% to 15% increase. As far as we can see, for the Q1, we actually achieved the goal for the quarter. Q2, we are almost there. We are moving on to achieve the goal two. At this point, we don't see any major issue to miss the target for the year.Richard Geronimo -- Private Investor -- AnalystOkay. That's great news. The Malaysian project, when -- I know you've been doing the landfill or filling a new area. When do you expect construction to begin?Lizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director(Foreign Language) Already began, about one year.Brian Chen -- General Manager, Capital Markets DepartmentOkay.Lizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive DirectorAnd we are on our trait (ph). Yes. All the projects we look for, we will be end at end of this year or the next year, the first quarter of next year.Xuefeng Li -- Interim Chief Financial OfficerOkay.Brian Chen -- General Manager, Capital Markets DepartmentSo the landfill is supposed to be finished by the end of this year or early next year.Lizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive DirectorYeah.Richard Geronimo -- Private Investor -- AnalystOkay. And that's the 170 acre area under water? Is that correct.Brian Chen -- General Manager, Capital Markets DepartmentIt's actually some more.Lizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive DirectorNo, the 100 acre.Brian Chen -- General Manager, Capital Markets DepartmentOh, OK. It's actually 100 acre.Lizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive DirectorYeah.,Richard Geronimo -- Private Investor -- AnalystOkay. So it's 100 acres.Lizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive DirectorYes.Richard Geronimo -- Private Investor -- AnalystOkay. I guess, I have one more question about the Hudson project. How is that going to be marketed? I mean, there -- obviously, there is friction between Chinese and Americans. And how do you plan on marketing that so that you get the best return?Brian Chen -- General Manager, Capital Markets DepartmentYeah. It's hard to say because the situation is very hard for now because of some of the relationship between the two countries. We will -- based on the local market for now way. Now, we analyze the market and we want to determine our price, our beginning.Lizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive DirectorYeah. The project is located in the good area, Hell's Kitchen, and comparing to the building nearby, our price is reasonable. We believed and we had a pretty good local sales and marketing teams. At this point, we have no reason to believe that we cannot move to sell, based on the local demand and the local team.OperatorWe will take our next question from Rupesh (ph) Patel, Private Investor.Unidentified ParticipantHi. I had one question on the stock buyback program. I know that's lesser (inaudible) if the company had approved $40 million to spend behind stock buyback. My question is how much of that approved amount remains for future stock buyback?Brian Chen -- General Manager, Capital Markets DepartmentWould you please repeat the question?Lizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive DirectorWhat is the question? We didn't get the -- can you repeat your question?Unidentified ParticipantSure. The stock buyback program, how much money is available with the company to purchase stock back from the market? Let me rephrase it. The Board of the company had approved $40 million to spend behind stock buyback, and the company has already bought back some shares. And then, how much money is left for future buyback?Xuefeng Li -- Interim Chief Financial OfficerOkay. For that original program, we have already used pretty much almost all of them so far. We are in the process to submit an application to our Board to apply for some quota to continue that program.Unidentified ParticipantOkay. Thank you. That's all I had.Operator(Operator Instructions) We'll take next question from Mark Skitt (ph), Private Investor.Mark Skitt -- Private Investor -- AnalystHi. Great earnings call for you guys. I just have one question. So, I see that you guys have both (ph) opportunities on New York. I was just wondering if you guys are seeing any opportunities in other cities in the US or maybe even Europe?Lizhou Zhang -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive DirectorFor the moment, the company is in the middle of the process, looking for new opportunity. But we are not expand without principle. We are only looking at the quality projects that we can manage it, and we can make sure to return reasonable profit and return to the company. We could also open. At this point, we are not limited by the region and the area. Obviously, previously, our presence in New York and little bit in London and Malaysia, this would be the base that we are trying to focus on.Mark Skitt -- Private Investor -- AnalystOkay. That's all I had. Thank you.OperatorThat concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Xuefeng Li. Please go ahead.Xuefeng Li -- Interim Chief Financial OfficerOkay.
