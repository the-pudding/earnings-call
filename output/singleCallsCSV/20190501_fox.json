Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on today's call.\nTo start, I will discuss our first quarter business and financial highlights. Mike and Chris will then provide a more detailed update on their respective businesses and brand development. Zvi will then review the first quarter financials and discuss our 2019 guidance. After that, we will open the call for your questions.\nWe had a great start to the year with record first quarter financial results, our business benefited from continued strong demand and solid execution in our Powered Vehicles Group and in our Specialty Sports Group. FOX's diversified product offerings continue to resonate with our customers. Demonstrating our commitment to product innovation and growth of FOX brands in both existing and new categories. We appreciate the strong efforts of our team as we continue to deliver differentiated products to our passionate customer base reinforcing the value of our brand. Our broad-based growth generated first quarter sales and profitability above our expectations. Our first quarter sales of $161.7 million increased 25% compared to the prior year period.\nFrom a profitability perspective, we reported non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.55 and adjusted EBITDA of $30.1 million, which were up 53% and 31% respectively. As a result of our strong first quarter results and our current view of the markets we serve, we are raising our outlook for the year which Zvi will outline for you in his portion of the call.\nToday, we are also excited to announce our definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Ridetech, a leading manufacturer of suspension systems that enhance the handling and right quality of muscle cars, trucks, sports cars and hot rods. We believe this strategic transaction will help us further expand our powered vehicles business. The transaction is expected to close in May 2019.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our strong start to 2019 and our outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to believe FOX's differentiated market position will fuel our expansion in the diverse end markets we serve.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nThank you, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of 2019, sales of powered vehicles products were up 34.1% compared to the first quarter of 2018. These strong sales results are due to the continued high growth across our product line up, particularly with our off-road capable, on-road suspension products, and our power sports products which exceeded our forecast.\nWhile we are pleased with this increased demand from our large OEM customers, it has shifted our expected mix causing our current California facilities to be near capacity and it's stretching our supply chain. Consequently, this has led to some frictional cost. We've identified areas where we can improve our processes and procedures and our teams are working hard to implement short-term solution. However, ultimately, solutions will be the most effective as we establish our new manufacturing footprint and supply chain in Georgia. We continue to focus on the off-road capable vehicle market and customers can now order the 2020 Jeep Gladiator Rubicon.\nJeep's top Gladiator model that features box shock. But media is crazy with the Gladiator. The editors at the drive -- thedrive.com wrote quote, the 2020 Jeep Gladiator Rubicon is the real star here, bringing everything that's made the JL Wrangler Rubicon such a hit to create the hands-down off-road king of pickups. Its Rock-Trak four wheel system, two-inch lift, FOX monotube shocks, rock rails, are a witch's brew of dirty fun. At FOX, we strategically explore diverse markets where we believe we can successfully apply our technologies and expertise and in March, we created a new street performance division to support these efforts, this new team focuses on developing performance defining products that can successfully compete in race, aftermarket and OEM street vehicle application.\nToday's announcement that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Ridetech is an example of this strategy in motion. Ridetech manufactures premium suspension systems that are designed to improve the handling and right quality of muscle cars, trucks, sports cars and hot rods. This acquisition aligns our mission of improving vehicle performance and entering strategic adjacent markets and is modestly accretive for 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to believe the expanded powered vehicles market now including street performance represents an attractive long-term growth opportunity.\nNow let's move on to some racing highlights. The strength in our powered vehicle racing presence, we recently established Fox Factory Motorsports, a new Group devoted to continuing and expanding our race efforts. On the off-road racing front, FOX drivers finished first and second at the 2019 Mint 400, also known as The Great American Off-Road Race. FOX driver, Justin Lofton placed first overall and become the event's first three time winner.\nAt the 33rd Annual SCORE San Felipe 250. The first round of the 2019 SCORE World Championship, FOX drivers, Andy and Dan McMillin finished first and third overall. This race also marked the first off-road race wins for FOX new Live Valve technology, Wayne and Kristen Matlock won the Pro UTV Forced Induction and Pro UTV Naturally Aspirated Classes on Live Valve. At the UTV World Championship in Laughlin, Nevada, FOX driver, Phil Burton made history by becoming one of the second three time winner of the events premiered desert race.\nRacing has and will remain a central part of our culture and our success and I believe the new Fox Factory Motorsports team is a start of great things to come. And finally, we are continuing to work on identifying my replacement as President of the Powered Vehicles Group. Our search both internally and externally has identified a short list of great candidates and we expect to conclude this process in the near future.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Tutton -- President\nThank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone. During my remarks today, I will talk about a few of the recent Specialty Sports Group business highlights. In the first quarter of 2019, sales of bike products were up 12.7% compared with the same period in fiscal 2018 and we are building on the strong performance we delivered last year. While we continue to meet or exceed our targets, our leadership team closely monitors the bike industry and market conditions. We are comfortable with our current and overall spec positions and inventory levels across our various sales and distribution channels. Last quarter, I talked about the relocation and consolidation of our US aftermarket distribution, sales, service operations from California to Sparks, Nevada to better service our customers. I'm pleased to share that the new Fox Factory service and distribution center is open for business and we started shipping products, the first week of April.\nThe new 72,000 square foot facility strengthens our ability to support FOX, Race Face, Easton Cycling and Marzocchi customers by centralizing all four brands, sales, service, order placement, fulfillment and shipping functions under one roof. I'm very proud of our team. Many people worked very hard to bring this facility online quickly, and without interrupting our business operations or inconveniencing our customers.\nI'd also like to share some product news. We recently introduced our 2020 Factory 32 Step Cast Fork engineered for the rigors of modern cross country riding and featuring a redesigned crown, our engineers increased stiffness by 20% placing on the same level as our trail proven 34 Step Cast Forks which added a mere 30 grams to its already lightweight chassis. Also new for 2019 is the FOX Transfer Seatpost , now over 175 millimeter drop option and a race-based lever choice.\nIn March, the Race 18 (ph) launched the new next SL Crankset featuring increased crank arm stiffness and a modest reduction to overall weight, thanks to our improved refined carbon layout at the manufacturing process. We recently introduced the Marzocchi Bomber CR coil shock, a high performance yet simple rear shock designed for bikes with travel on ranges of 130 millimeters to 200 millimeters. As Mike said, racing is central in our optimization and when FOX, Race Face, Easton and Marzocchi athletes win, it helps our innovative engineering technologies and products. We believe there is no better testing, than the rigors of professional mountain bike racing. Simply put, racing drives innovation, keeps our followers engaged with the SSG brand and helps to expand our customer base.\nHere are a few highlights from the start of the 2019 race season. FOX's SSG supported athletes won the 2019 FMBA Slopestyle World Champion promale (ph) opener in New Zealand. We earned four podiums in the first two rounds of the 2019 Enduro World Series and we shot eight podiums at the Crankworx Rotorua festival. Enduro World Series teams that we sponsor are currently ranked first, second and third after just the first two rounds. FOX, Race Face, Easton Cycling and Marzocchi athletes are off to a great start, and we look forward to building our race programs' 2019 success.\nAt this point, I'd now like to turn the call over to Zvi, to review our financial results.\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nThanks, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll focus on our first quarter results and then review our guidance. Sales in the first quarter of 2019 were $161.7 million, an increase of 24.6% versus sales of $129.8 million in the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin was 31.6% in the first quarter of 2019, a 50 basis point decrease from 32.1% in the prior year period. While our non-GAAP gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 31.7%. The decrease in gross margin was due to several factors including a change in customer and product mix, as our larger North American-based OEMs represented a higher proportion of sales and supply chain and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with a higher than anticipated increase in customer demand.\nWe expect these factors to continue, which could similarly affect margins in the next few quarters. As Mike mentioned, our team is executing improvement programs in our existing California facilities to mitigate the supply chain and factory inefficiencies while we are developing our new platform in Georgia. Total operating expenses were $29.2 million or 18% of sales in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $25.7 million or 19.8% in the first quarter last year. The increase in operating expenses on a dollar basis is primarily as a result of investments in research and development to support future growth, higher patent litigation-related expenses and increases in various other administrative expenses.\nWe saw some improvement in our operating leverage on the increased sales volume. Non-GAAP operating expenses stated as a percentage of sales were 15.7% in Q1 this year versus 17.3% in Q1 last year. Focusing on expenses in more detail. Sales and marketing was up $600,000 as we continue to invest in the brand, while R&D was up $1.1 million primarily due to increased personnel investments to support new product innovation. As we have consistently stated, the timing of R&D and promotional expenses often changes between quarters and years depending on a number of factors including product launch cycles.\nOur general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were $11.1 million compared to $9.2 million in the prior year period. The change was primarily due to $1 million in personnel related investments we've made to enhance our infrastructure to support the top line growth and changes in our business and $700,000 increase in ongoing litigation related expenses. For the first quarter of 2019, our effective tax rate was 12.4% compared to a tax benefit of 44.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe first quarter fiscal count (ph) 2018 included a one-time benefit of $9.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share due to a favorable resolution of the Company's 2015 IRS audit. Excluding the benefit, the first quarter fiscal 2018 effective rate was 20.9%. Adjusted EBITDA was $30.1 million for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $23 million in the same quarter last year, adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.6% compared to 17.7% in the prior year quarter. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin is due to improved operating leverage primarily related to lower SG&A percentage.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income attributable to FOX in the first quarter of 2019 was $18.1 million or $0.46 per diluted share compared to net income of $21.2 million or earnings of $0.55 per diluted share in the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted net income was $21.6 million, an increase of $7.5 million compared to $14.1 million in the first quarter of the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019 was $0.55 compared to $0.36 in the first quarter of 2018. Now focusing on our balance sheet. As of March 29, 2019, we have cash on hand of $38.3 million, total debt outstanding was $69.6 million compared to $59.4 million as in December 28, 2018.\nInventory was $124.1 million compared to a $107.1 million at the end of 2018, accounts receivable was $83.6 million compared to $78.9 million as of December 28, 2018 and accounts payable was $75.6 million compared to $55.1 million at the end of 2018. The changes in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable are primarily attributable to the growth in our business and normal seasonality. Additionally, our net property, plant and equipment increased to $85 million as of March 29, 2019 compared to $64.8 million at the end of 2018, which includes $15.4 million due to the impact of the new lease accounting standard in the first quarter of 2019.\nNow turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2019. We expect sales in the range of $182 million to $190 million and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.62 to $0.67. For fiscal year 2019, we are raising our outlook and now expect sales in the range of $717 million to $733 million. We expect Ridetech sales contribution to be in the range of $6 million to $8 million in 2019 after the elimination of inter-Company sales and anticipate the acquisition to close in May 2019.\nWe expect non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.52 to $2.62 for fiscal 2019. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margin percentage to be fairly consistent with 2018 EBITDA margin percentage. However, we now expect gross margin percentage to be down slightly for 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the change in mix resulting from increased revenue contribution from large North American OEMs and inefficiencies in the supply chain and manufacturing associated with higher than anticipated increase in customer demand.\nAs a reminder, larger OEMs can have lower gross margins than aftermarket customers and smaller OEM. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to run 15.5% to 16% for 2018 down from our previous outlook as we are getting better than anticipated leverage in SG&A on our increased sales outlook. I would also like to point out that our guidance continues to impact -- include the impact of tariffs and higher input costs based on current conditions.\nWe expect our normal seasonality to continue with our Q3 sales being slightly higher than our Q4 sales. We expect CapEx for 2019 to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% of sales, which reflect the impact of our previously announced operation expansion. Our long-term capital expenditure model remains at 3% to 4% of sales. Our guidance assumes an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 15% to 19%. We continue to expect some quarterly fluctuation in tax rates to occur during the year due to the timing of certain variables such as stock option exercises and stock prices that are difficult to predict.\nI'd also like to note that we are not providing guidance on GAAP EPS as it cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the difficulty of accurately predicting the elements necessary to provide such guidance and reconciliation.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Larry.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Zvi. And with that, we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator?\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Scott Stember, CL King. Go ahead, please.\nScott Stember -- CL King & Associates, Inc -- Analyst\nThat's Scott Stember. Thanks, guys, and thanks for taking my questions.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey Scott.\nScott Stember -- CL King & Associates, Inc -- Analyst\nCan you talk about Ridetech because Zvi, I heard you say that there were some intercompany eliminations, it sounds like, obviously you are already doing some business with Ridetech, maybe just explain the prior relationship and how -- maybe just a little bit of a broader view, how synergistic this could be going down the road?\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nScott, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. Let me take a stab at that. So we had a relationship. They were a customer of ours prior to the acquisition. It wasn't -- it wasn't a large customer of ours, but we do provide shocks that go in some of the suspension systems, and as we've taken that into consideration in our go-forward guidance. For us, this is really about opening the door and the whole adjacent market that we're not in today and really being able to go -- get us some market size and scale with -- that, we'd like to get to. So for us this is really a platform, if you will into that new space into the new market and I think, looking forward, it can be, it can be a great business for us. It will take us some time to digest it and to get -- to get it up and running the way we wanted to, but we are very, very positive.\nScott Stember -- CL King & Associates, Inc -- Analyst\nAnd are there any cross pollination opportunities or any opportunity to put through more of the core power products.\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nI absolutely believe, yes. And I think it's a request. I mean, I believe so. I think there's a lot we can do with this platform, which looks very similar and works very similar to our sport truck operation and some of our other businesses. So I think this has synergies on the front end across several of those.\nScott Stember -- CL King & Associates, Inc -- Analyst\nAnd you guys talked about the strong OEM business, the big mix toward that looks like in power sports, but can you talk about the aftermarket, how that performed in both specialty and powered vehicles?\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYes, we don't break out the aftermarket OEM in the two respective businesses in terms of the actual percentage. So with that, I'll let Mike and Chris give a little color about what they think about performance but we're not going to provide actual numbers.\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nYes, Scott on the powered vehicle side. We talked about power sports absolutely being a very productive part of Q1 and so was our off-road business, which tends to look like OEMs and have a healthy mix of aftermarket, in both of those cases off-road on the OEM side and aftermarket, it was a great quarter for us and so both were extremely healthy, but the mix did shift based on some increased volume from the OEMs, specifically.\nChris Tutton -- President\nThanks, Scott. It's Chris here. On the bike side, certainly we feel very confident in our spec positions and the customers on the bikes that we compete on are doing well. So we're happy with our OEM numbers, we're happy with our aftermarket numbers, we're seeing growth through all of our international distributors. So it's a wide mix, but I think, there isn't -- it's early study.\nScott Stember -- CL King & Associates, Inc -- Analyst\nAll right, just one quick last question on the commercial vehicle side, can you just give an update on how some of those pilot programs are going?\nChris Tutton -- President\nYes. They're going well. We're still early days. As I said in the last earnings call, we'll continue to kind of work through this over the course of this year, but we are seeing traction and significant opportunity in that space. So we continue to be very excited and very positive on that on a long term basis.\nScott Stember -- CL King & Associates, Inc -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks again.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Scott.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from Larry Solow, CJS Securities. Go ahead, please.\nLawrence Solow -- CJS Securities, Inc -- Analyst\nGreat, thanks very much. And Larry this might be your last public call as the CEO so commend you and wish you congratulations again.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Larry.\nLawrence Solow -- CJS Securities, Inc -- Analyst\nAbsolutely. On the Ridetech, just the -- I found it encouraging that as I see there -- there's some, they are getting some shares and some skin in the game. Was that something that they ask for? And I guess the management team staying on board?\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nYeah, the management team is absolutely staying on board, Larry, this is Mike. And this is something that they also were very excited about in terms of, as you said, have skin in the game. We like that kind of a set up because that means we are all one team working toward the same ultimate objective and it seems to -- it seems to be a really good recipe.\nChris Tutton -- President\nYeah, I would tell you that we've done a few deals and we've used different mechanisms in each deal to ensure that management was aligned with FOX. In the case of sports (inaudible) we did earn-out. In the case of Tuscany, we bought 80% not 100% of the company. In the case of Ridetech, they took a fair bit of the purchase price in stock. Is different mechanisms for different situations? We think they all depend on the particulars of the situation and we think this aligns the interests of management with that.\nLawrence Solow -- CJS Securities, Inc -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And then on the specialty products, or bikes particularly grew. I think you said 13% in the quarter, a little bit above sort of I think the full-year guidance or the normal sort of mid-to-high single-digit growth rate. Is that mostly sort of the follow through or model year '19 and then sort of not reset. But it will -- as we go into Q2, that will be more predominantly model year '20 sales going forward?\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nI think we had good momentum coming out of 2018 into 2019, which certainly help carry us through. We're, again we're watching the industry very closely, we think that we're on track for the season. So I think everything is in line at this point.\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYeah, I will say, at the beginning of the year, we gave guidance -- we indicated that SSG business would be in line with its mid to high single digit target, we debated that in Q1. We are not calling (ph) that up for the balance of the year and we also said that the powered vehicle business would be ahead of the low-double digit target. So we're keeping an eye on it. I think, Chris, and the team are very pleased, but no change for the full year, we would still call it -- and in line with our longer term target mid to high-single digit rate.\nLawrence Solow -- CJS Securities, Inc -- Analyst\nRight, OK. No. Fair enough. And just on the OpEx, you are getting a little bit more leverage obviously this year with -- as growth sort of above historical averages. Is this something that I know, one quarter does not make a trend, but something that as you look out over the next few years, you think you can get a little, maybe little more leverage in the business?\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nYes, we're not prepared to make a call on the longer term. Any change to the longer SG&A. We are willing to say that this year it's going to run at 15.5% to 16% versus our initial guidance, which was 16% to 16.5%, sometimes as you get larger OEM businesses, you're able to get more SG&A leverage. We've been fortunate in the last few years, we've grown the top line, well above our long-term targets and we aim to get more efficient. When that happens. But we would reserve the right to give future guidance next year, when we give you...\nLawrence Solow -- CJS Securities, Inc -- Analyst\nAbsolutely, fine, OK, great. Appreciate it. Thanks guys.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from Mike Swartz, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Go ahead please.\nMichael A. Swartz -- Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. -- Analyst\nHey good evening, guys.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood evening, Mike.\nMichael A. Swartz -- Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. -- Analyst\nJust on the Ridetech business maybe give us a sense if you can maybe how large that adjacent market is relative to some of your core markets and as we look at that acquisition, should be thinking really the strategic rational, is it more of a distribution or a product basis?\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nI'll take your. This is Mike. Let me take your second question first. This is actually product and distribution. So if you think about their model, it's heavily e-Commerce oriented and has a good -- a good section of direct to consumer, which I like. They also though develop products and they have developed some innovative technologies in the on road category especially around race and some of those types of categories that we really like. So I would say, it's both a go-to-market strategy and the product innovation. In terms of the TAM. The second -- first part of your question. In terms of TAM, I actually think on road is as big or bigger than off road depending on the cycle and the market what we're doing and where we want to focus on keeping in mind, our objective is to stay in performance-enhancing products that are really premium-oriented. So sizing the market is one function, what part of that market, we want to actually go after is the most important function. So we think, it's a significant market for sure and we're going to make sure that we stay where we want to be in that space.\nMichael A. Swartz -- Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And then second question, just maybe for Zvi, during the quarter, you said you had some inefficiencies in some I guess frictional cost related to demand coming in stronger than expected in powered vehicle. Any sense of how much that impacted gross margin and then how long should we expect some of those inefficiencies? The last, is this really predicated upon the new distributors -- sorry the new capacity on Georgia -- in Georgia coming online?\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYeah, we would tell you that that the impact on margin was comprised of two elements. The larger element of the two factors was mix. We had a greater proportion of sales to our larger North American-based powered vehicle OEMs. And then in satisfying that demand that you mentioned, we had frictional cost in the supply chain with kind of -- and with some of the kind of their usual suspects over time logistic, freight, logistics and things of that nature. We're evolving the platform to Georgia, and so where ordinarily, you might put more longer-term improvements in place in California, doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense to make longer term investments in California, while your real plan for improvement is in Georgia. We would tell you that we think, we're going to continue to see the impact for the next few quarters and whereas we previously said there'd be some improvement in gross margin this year. And now, we would tell you that the margin will be in the same neighborhood as what they were last year, on a full year basis.\nMichael A. Swartz -- Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay, great. That's it for me. Thanks guys.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Mike.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question...\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nJust a quick correction. A slightly down gross margins, but the EBITDA margins would be more or less equivalent, same neighborhood.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from Craig Kennison, Robert W Baird & Co. Go ahead please.\nCraig Kennison -- Robert W Baird & Co -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question as well. Kind of wanted to follow up on the Ridetech questions. In the press release, it's described as a leading manufacturer of suspension systems. But again, just looking at the website, they sell a lot of different components. To what extent is the revenue, it derives based on product they manufactures versus products it sources from others?\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nYeah, I mean quite a bit of what their -- of their sales come from the products they manufacture, their manufacturing is in Tennessee, if you look in Kentucky, you are right, Indiana. So a lot of it comes from manufacturing in Indiana. At the same time, as I said before, this is also about kind of their e-Commerce their direct to consumer model that we like and some of those product category, it's products that they're selling on behalf of others. So I'd say, it's a good mix, but a large part of what they are selling is manufactured and has in some cases box shocks in that baggage.\nCraig Kennison -- Robert W Baird & Co -- Analyst\nAre there any OEM relationships tied to Ridetech or is this truly an aftermarket play at this point?\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nAftermarket.\nCraig Kennison -- Robert W Baird & Co -- Analyst\nGreat. Yes. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Craig.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from Rafe Jadrosich, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please.\nRafe Jadrosich -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi, Good afternoon, it's Rafe. Thanks for taking my question.\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nhi Rafe.\nRafe Jadrosich -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nZvi, just a follow up on -- I just want to follow up on your comments earlier about the gross margin impact from the mix shift to the larger OEMs. Can you talk about the operating margins for some of those larger OEM versus the Ridetech gross margin.\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYes, I mean, it varies from OEM to OEM. I would point out that our EBITDA margins. We still expect to be roughly in line for the full year. So we're pleased that despite the mix being unfavorable from a gross margin point of view, we expect to be more or less equivalent, on a full year basis in that 20% plus or minus for -- on full year EBITDA margin. So I think we're pleased with those margins, we strive to improve the EBITDA margins over time. But part of that, part of the formula to get there is to get to Georgia, when you, the Company has been a pretty fast growing enterprise for a long time and there is often a lag between creating volume and growing efficiently versus meeting customer demand, with the increase in customer demand, we did see some inefficiencies that are going to affect our margins.\nRafe Jadrosich -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOkay. That's really helpful. And then.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, Rafe, I would point out that this is really nothing new for us. We've gone through this in growth periods before we've talked about it, I think this is something we're not uncomfortable managing through and our teams here have a good plan to deal with it.\nRafe Jadrosich -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nAnd then in terms of -- you called out momentum in the off-road capable, on-road vehicles. Can you just remind us how many vehicles you're on right now. And then the timing of some of the newer launches like Gladiator and then and Ranger like, when you started to sell in and make for those vehicles.\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nYeah, let me give you an overview there, Rafe. So on the form (ph) platform where on Ranger Raptor, which isn't sold in the US, yet, it's overseas and of course we are on the model year '19 Raptor would lined out. So you know those too, I am sure. In Toyota, we're on the entire line up of TRD vehicle, so Sequoia (inaudible) Tundra and that's the one. But all of those on the -- follow on the TRD Pro. And then in -- with Jeep we are on the new JTV Roubicon pickup truck. So those are, those are the big ones and they come out at different times. So it's hard for us to always predict exactly when they hit the dealerships, I know you can order the JTV Roubicon now, but I'm not sure across, Toyota. I think, they wanted too -- they're still in the process of launching.\nRafe Jadrosich -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOkay. And then the last question for Chris, as you -- can you just talk about the trends you're seeing in E-Bikes? What's the growth rate and then how significant is that for your business?\nChris Tutton -- President\nYeah, the growth rate is significant. It has been strong, five high double digits in Europe and its been strong single to early double digits in North America. We are seeing -- we were well positioned with our E-optimized products to be those bikes. So we have a good spec position through on E-Bikes, we are continuing to see it grow, we think that's going to be a real bright spot moving forward. So moving into the next two model years, we see big growth in E-Bike.\nRafe Jadrosich -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nCan you talk about -- is it meaningful yet to the overall size is still very small or I am just trying to get a sense of like the base?\nChris Tutton -- President\nIt's meaningful, I would say, as part of the market position is concerned, it's probably 35% of the European business and probably 15% to 25% of the North American non bike business.\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nI would like to point out that some of those E-Bike sales there is some shifting from bikes that were previously not electric. So it's not all incremental obviously.\nChris Tutton -- President\nNo. Exactly.\nRafe Jadrosich -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThank you for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from Brennan Matthews, Berenberg, go ahead please.\nBrennan Matthews -- Berenberg -- Analyst\nHi, thank you very much for taking my question. You got... I wanted to ask about the new Street performance division. Obviously you kind of, you entered it with the Ridetech acquisition, but is that something you are thinking, you're going to kind of grow more organically going forward too maybe with some tuck-ins. And then kind of from the R&D side, I mean should we expect kind of some more investment to kind of develop some of these kind of street or on-road products?\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nYeah. Brennan, it's good question, this is Mike. So I think when you look forward in to street performance, it's going to be a combination of organic growth in using some of the leveraging and development innovation we've done like Live Valve and off-road employing that into street performance. I think electrification happens across markets pretty efficiently. But I do think there will be additional acquisitions as we go forward and expand that market presence and so we'll continue to do that. I think in addition to that, we will invest in innovation in that area, but we can leverage pretty heavily what we've done, as I said before, you will see us invest in areas like straps and things like that that are little bit unique to the on-road market that are not in the off-road market. But then that will happen over time and it won't be a significant change in any of our guidance in terms of how we think about investment.\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYes, I mean the only thing I would add to it is we bought this company. We are extremely excited about the opportunity to help us get into an area of the market more heavily than we are today. One of the attractions of buying some of these smaller companies, they've tended to under invest in their platform and we will plan to reinvest a lot of those sales growth in sales and marketing, R&D and even to some degree in the infrastructure required to be a public company. So this is an acquisition, we're very excited about. But in terms of financial contribution to FOX this year and even next year. We don't expect a lot of financial bottom line impact because it will run higher SG&A expenses than is typical because it's in kind of an earlier stage growth mode relative to FOX.\nBrennan Matthews -- Berenberg -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you so much. That's all from me.\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Ryan Sundby, William Blair. Go ahead please.\nRyan Ingemar -- William Blair -- Analyst\nYeah, hi. Thanks everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey Ryan, how are you?\nRyan Ingemar -- William Blair -- Analyst\nGood. Larry, you've always talked about acquiring companies, they didn't know they were for sale, can you maybe just talk a little bit about how the transaction came up. It was in auction with the soft market, just curious about that.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, look, let me just describe it. I think very similar to some of the other transactions we've had, they were our customer. We've known them for a long time. They weren't for sale. We did not participate in an auction, we sat down with them and I think, we were able to have a meeting of the minds you know on value. But more importantly on strategic direction of that business and what we can do together versus what they could do on their own and we could do on our own. And I think, that's a pretty good formula for us. As Zvi mentioned, we've structured all of these things a little bit different depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular deal, but I think in all cases, we've ended up with an alignment between management and ourselves. But that we're very comfortable with. So yeah, I think this is all about expanding TAM, getting another market segment, we can go after. And this albeit pretty small, we're excited about what it could mean in the future.\nRyan Ingemar -- William Blair -- Analyst\nGreat, thanks. And then I guess two more maybe one for Mike. As I look at the website, I see 20 different product categories across six different end markets. Are there certain -- are there couple of products or markets that stand out in terms of size or profitability or kind of focus areas for FOX's broader ambitions and then for Zvi, is there seasonality to this business and any kind of thoughts on what historical credits look like?\nMike Dennison -- Director and President, Powered Vehicles Group\nRyan, let me start. From my perspective, this is really about driving innovation from race and aftermarket, first. So we're really focused on markets that can create product technologies that can enter into a broader aftermarket segment. So there's a lot of interesting parts of Ridetech that we're very interested in. Because of the ones that we're going to focus on helping create innovation and, prior to this call, I talked about the fact that we can cross-pollinate some of these technologies between our different divisions, it will very active in that space, doing that. So to me, again, we're going to focus like we always do in race and aftermarket first and the high end of the aftermarket and then through (ph) that takes us and do a broader more mainstream category.\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nYes, this is Zvi. In terms of seasonality, their season -- there is some seasonality in the business, the seasonality is close to FOX's seasonality and given the small relative size of this and its contribution to FOX, it doesn't really move the needle.\nRyan Ingemar -- William Blair -- Analyst\nGot it. And then Zvi, just a follow-up there. The $14 million purchase price. Just so we can model the shares is right. What percentage of that was from equity?\nZvi Glasman -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n50% of it was in equity and that's... yeah.\nRyan Ingemar -- William Blair -- Analyst\nPerfect, thank you.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. We currently do not have any further questions in the queue, so I'll take the opportunity to hand the call back to you, Larry.\nLarry L. Enterline -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.
