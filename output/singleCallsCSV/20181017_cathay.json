After comments by management today, we will open up this call up for questions.\nI will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Pin Tai.\nPin Tai -- Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director\nThank you, Georgia, and good afternoon. Welcome to our 2018 third quarter earnings conference call. This afternoon, we reported net income of $69.8 million for the third quarter of 2018, a 40.2%(ph)increase when compared to a net income of $49.7 million for the third quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share increased 39.3% to $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.61 per share for the same quarter one year ago.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, our gross loans grew by $298.9 million to $13.6 billion, or an increase of 9.3% on an annualized basis. The increase in loans for the third quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by the continued strong growth in the residential mortgage loans of $190.2 million(ph)or 24.9% annualized, and commercial loans of $97.4 million or 15.6% annualized. We continue to project loan growth in 2018 to be between 7% to 8%.\nFor the third quarter of 2018, our total deposits increased $476.5 million or 15% annualized to $13.6 billion, mainly as a result of a summer CD promotion. We continue to monitor and evaluate the trade distance(ph)between the U.S. and China and potential impacts to our loan portfolio.\nAs of September 30th, 2018 those borrowers which we believe will be adversely impacted by the current tariffs will be less than 2.5% of our total loans. We are in frequent contact with these borrowers and many have indicated that they believe that much of the 10% tariffs will be shared between manufacturers, importers, retailers and customers. Many of these borrowers are also evaluating sourcing some of their products from other countries. Through September 30th, 2018 there have been no non-accruals or charge-offs that were linked to the imposition of the tariff.\nWith that, I will turn the floor over to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Heng Chen, to discuss the third quarter 2018 financials in more detail.\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nThank you, Pin, and good afternoon everyone. For the third quarter, we announced net income of $69.8 million or $0.85 per share. Our net interest margin was 3.83% in the third quarter 2018 as compared to 3.75% in the third quarter of 2017, and 3.83% for the second quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, interest recoveries and prepayment penalties added 5 basis points to the net interest margin compared to 4 basis points for the second quarter of 2018 and 16 basis points for the third quarter of 2017. Given the third quarter results, we believe that our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be between 3.8% to 3.85%.\nNon-interest income during the third quarter of 2018 decreased by $5.2 million to $7.8 million when compared to the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the $5.4 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2017 from the acquisition of SinoPac Bancorp, the parent company of Far East National Bank.\nNon-interest expense increased by $4.7 million(ph)or 7.7%(ph)to $66 million in the third quarter of 2018 when compared to $61.2 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the third quarter of 2018, the increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $2.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense and a $5.4 million increase in amortization expense of investments in low income housing and alternative energy partnerships, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in acquisition and integration costs, when compared to the same quarter a year ago.\nThe effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 21.1%. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be approximately 19.3%. The third quarter effective tax rate reflects a year-to-date adjustment to the new full-year effective tax rate. In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized $5.7 million of amortization expense from solar tax credit investment that was made in the second quarter 2018. We expect solar tax credit amortization of approximately $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAt September 30, 2018, our Tier 1 leverage capital ratio increased to 11.03% as compared to 10.35% at December 31, 2017 while Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased to 12.81% from 12.19% at December 31, 2017, and our total risk-based capital ratio increased to 14.6% from 14.11% at December 31, 2017.\nNet recoveries for the third quarter of 2018 were $3.1 million compared to net charge-offs of $185,000 in the second quarter of 2018 and net recoveries of $5.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. There was a loan loss reversal of $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to no loan loss provision in the second quarter of 2018 and third quarter of 2017.\nOur non-accrual loans decreased by $23 million to $42.4 million or 0.31% of period-end loans as compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nPin Tai -- Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director\nThank you, Heng. We will now proceed to the question-and-answer portion of the call.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nCathay General Bancorp (CATY) Q1 2019 Earnings Call Transcript\n\n\nCathay General Bancorp (CATY) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript\n\n\n3 Top Bank Stocks to Buy Now\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Aaron Deer with Sandler O'Neill.\nAaron Deer -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nThe growth again this quarter was strong and it seems to be still centered in the residential book. Chris,(ph)what kind of rates are you getting on that new production today? And with rates continuing to drift higher, what's your outlook for the growth in that business as we go forward?\nPin Tai -- Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director\nWell the current rate that we are underwriting is about 4.5% to 5% (inaudible) residential mortgage loan is 3.1% or 5.1% adjusted for rate of mortgage. And this -- the current underwriting rate is slightly higher than the (inaudible) of 4.57% in the third quarter.\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nYeah, and then Aaron, most of our originations are purchases. So we don't think that higher interest rates will slow that down. There is some seasonality during the holiday season and also Chinese New Year. So it may slow down because of that.\nAaron Deer -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nAnd then I don't know if you guys are prepared to kind of talk about 2019 at this point, but obviously the growth has been pretty good this year. As you look out to next year, do you have a sense of what kind of growth we should expect?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nWell, we haven't finished our planning yet. We suspect it will be similar to this year. But in January we'll certainly have a formal guidance.\nAaron Deer -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nSure. I guess maybe similarly looking out to 2019, Heng you gave an update in terms of what we should expect for the low income housing credits and tax rate related to that. Have you been talking with your partners in that business yet about investments that you might be making in 2019 and what level we might expect going forward?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nYes, we need to get regulatory approval and so we -- it takes some time. But assuming we make another investment, our tax rate should be -- for the year should be close to -- for 2019, 19.5% and the amortization expense will be about $20 million, compared to $17 million this year.\nAaron Deer -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nOkay. Perfect, thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Michael Young with SunTrust.\nMichael Young -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division -- Analyst\nJust wanted to go back on the deposit side and just wondering if you could provide some color on the summer CD special, and anything else you plan to do maybe around the holiday season this year, just to give us a sense of what your expectation is on rate and data(ph)going forward?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nYeah, we were targeting our summer CD promotion actually goes into -- it finishes this week. So we are targeting about $600 million of net new funds and it's -- I think we will wind up laying that path(ph)through September 30, we have about $500 million. And then surprisingly there was a -- the pace of that is still pretty constant even though there was a Fed rate increase in the last week of September, and the broker CD rates moved up by about 25 basis points, but we're still getting the same new volume. And then going to next year, we will do another Chinese New Year promotion. The rates, we haven't set up the rate yet, but it probably will be a little bit higher than the 2.25%(ph)rate that we're offering now.\nMichael Young -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division -- Analyst\nOkay. So just kind of taking that all together and I guess with the assumption of continued steady growth on the loan side, would you expect your deposit balance to remain relatively similar to where we're at today moving forward?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nI think so. One of the favorable surprises for the third quarter was that our non-interest-bearing demand deposits on average went up $117 million and some of the -- seasonally the second half of the year is a little stronger for core deposits, so that helps us. And then the other thing is we still -- through today, we still haven't updated our poster rate for money market rates. It's still -- we're following the big banks and as long as the larger banks are sitting tight, we sit tight as well.\nMichael Young -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division -- Analyst\nAnd one last one, just on the recovery pipeline that's been benefiting provision for a while. Just what's the current outlook now and into 2019? Do you think you'll be able to continue to harvest those and keep provision at pretty low levels or near zero?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nWe still have the same couple of large potential recoveries in the $10 million to $15 million range. But we can't predict what quarter they'll pop up. So we -- it's just a couple of B notes(ph)and we have to depend on the customer to want to sell the properties. But aside from that because so much of our loan growth is coming from residential mortgage, we think our loan loss provision won't be moderate because once again half of the loan growth is residential mortgage which we only need about 50 basis points in reserve for that.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Jaffray.\nMatthew Timothy Clark -- Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division -- Analyst\nCould you just isolate the low income housing tax credit amortization in the third quarter from the solar? And then you gave the $12 million on solar, but could you also give it on the low income housing for the fourth quarter?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nYes. So this might be a little rough, but it's -- the total was $11.1 million and we had $5.6 million in solar. So the rest is what $4. --(ph)it's roughly $5 million?\nPin Tai -- Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director\nYeah.\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nAnd then in the fourth quarter, the solar -- our guidance from last quarter was $15 million, now it's down to $12 million. And then normally, the low income housing amortization is about $6 million a quarter.\nMatthew Timothy Clark -- Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division -- Analyst\nGot it. Okay. Great. And then other fee income looked a little light on a sequential basis, flattish year-over-year, but just wondered if there was anything unusual in there within that that might be seasonal?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nWell, there was about $900,000 of a mark-to-market on the value of our swaps. And it's unusually high, so we will think -- we think it will turn around in the fourth quarter. These are the swaps that are hedging our fixed rate loans.\nMatthew Timothy Clark -- Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division -- Analyst\nRight. Okay. And then any update on your capital management plans in the fourth quarter and into 2019?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nWell, I think last quarter I mentioned that we would in the first quarter call up to $50 million of our troughs. And then we also said that we would buy back our stock when that's below $40(ph)and surprisingly it's here. So we will be back -- we will be in the market next week if the stock price is below that.\nAnd in terms of the amount, we had 930,000 shares that we issued at SinoPac and then over the last two years we had all told about 600,000 shares issued from stock options and the vesting of the restricted stock units. So we historically have bought back low(ph)share issuances. So the total is probably(ph)1.5 million shares then.\nMatthew Timothy Clark -- Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division -- Analyst\nGot it. And then just last one, any thoughts around potential cost savings -- cost saving initiatives next year? And also, as a partial offset or any related investments or things you're working on projects?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nWell, our healthcare premiums are down by almost $1 million in a VP(ph)contract which we renewed in July is also going to save us well. And then we're thinking of some process improvement in the back room which will dribble in in 2019 that will save us. We don't know how much but it's going to be a reasonable amount. So we're really focused on delivering positive offering(ph)leverage and we know that's a constant effort.\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW.\nChris McGratty -- KBW -- Analyst\nThanks for the question. In terms of the balance sheet growth, I think 7% to 8% loan growth, how should we be thinking about continued(ph)securities purchases and then kind of managing the size of the investment portfolio from here?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nYes, we think that the -- we'll start to ramp up the securities portfolio gradually. It could be that interest rates peak late in 2019 and if that happens we would want to have a larger securities portfolio. But we're also pretty mindful of the NIM. But I think we'll be drifting higher in 2019, mainly with the 15-year MBS.\nChris McGratty -- KBW -- Analyst\nAnd if I could follow up on the prior question on capital, aside from the dividend and share repurchases and organic growth, how are you and the Board thinking of external M&A? Is that something that is a priority? Are there a lot of opportunities in your markets? Any comments there would be great.\nPin Tai -- Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director\nWe are always looking out for prudential target. (inaudible) as price, but we're continuing watching out. There's no (inaudible) right now.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets.\nLana Chan -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHi. Good afternoon. Just want to ask about the commercial loan growth. You started to get some good C&I growth over the last quarter or two. Which industry segments are those participations?\nPin Tai -- Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director\nWell, you probably (inaudible) last year, so we're seeing some increase in the loan commitment and loan outstanding in the area(ph). And we also see some new commercial C&I loans coming from different specialized industries.\nLana Chan -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. And then on the --\nPin Tai -- Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director\nAnd this is not from participation, I guess, it's not significantly from participation, sorry.\nLana Chan -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. And my other question was around CRE. I think you guys had made some commentaries over last two quarters about just more competitive conditions on CRE side. Can you talk about that? And what we should expect in terms of that portfolio because it is a pretty big business in terms of your loan book?\nPin Tai -- Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director\nThe CRE loan is still very competitive. There is no change from the previous quarter. And given that we understand coming in 2019, 2020 the market might be softening so we are more careful in underwriting the new loans. So that's why we will see a growth in the CRE loan in the last couple of quarters.\nOperator\nAnd our final question comes from David Chiaverini with Wedbush Securities.\nDavid Chiaverini -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\nA question on -- first a clarification on the NIM guidance, the 3.8% to 3.85%, was that for the fourth quarter or for the full-year 2018?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nJust for fourth quarter.\nDavid Chiaverini -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. And could you talk about -- and since we're smacked out in the middle of that range at 3.83% for the third quarter, could you talk about what could potentially cause that to go to the upper end of the range and vice versa what could cause it to be at the lower end of the range?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nWell, I think what could cause that to go up higher is if we have more prepayment penalties. So we are at 5 basis points right now. And then in terms of what could go lower, well, it's a same factor. And then if -- the risk for banks such as us is if money market deposit rates start to move significantly it only increased by 8 basis points in the Q3 from 68 to 79 -- I am sorry, let's say 11 basis points. So, we are starting to see movement there, but that's always a concern for us, the money market pricing.\nDavid Chiaverini -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. And then can you provide what the period-end deposit rate was? I think the average was 1.05% for the quarter. Do you have what it was at September 30th?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nNo. We just have it for the month of September handy. We normally don't compute it. So the month of September -- the average rate for interest-bearing liabilities was 1.22% versus it was 1.15% for the quarter.\nDavid Chiaverini -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\nAnd do you have a similar number for the loan side -- loan yield?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nYes, I mean -- well, for earning assets that's 4.74% versus 4.67%.\nDavid Chiaverini -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. 4.74% was for the month of September?\nHeng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nYes, but we would book our push as account accretions only at the end of the quarter, so it's skewed a little bit by that.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. I would now like to turn the call back over to Cathay General Bancorp's management for any closing remarks.\nPin Tai -- Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director\nThank you for joining us for this call and we look forward to speaking with you in our next quarterly earnings release date.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.
