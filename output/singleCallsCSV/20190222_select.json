Ortenzio -- Executive Chairman & Co-Founder\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for Select Medical's fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call for 2018. Before I outline our operational metrics, I want to provide you with some summary comments and some updates since we spoke last quarter. On an overall basis, 2018 was a year of nice growth for us in terms of net revenue and adjusted EBITDA.\nNet revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded prior year by 16.4% and 19.9% respectively. We acquired U.S. Healthworks last February and our Concentra team is doing a great job of integrating this acquisition. We also signed or closed several new joint ventures, commenced construction on several new JV hospitals and expanded our service lines in some of our existing joint venture partnerships.\nDuring 2018, we added two new rehab hospitals, one in partnership with Ochsner Health in New Orleans and one was an additional hospital on our Baylor joint venture in the Austin market. We also started up one new Critical Illness Recovery hospital while closing four Critical Illness Recovery hospitals throughout the year.\nOur hospital in Panama City, Florida remains temporarily closed due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Michael. Also entered into a joint venture with Banner Health, which started with outpatient services in 2018 and currently includes two new rehabilitation hospitals on a construction, Arizona, scheduled to open in 2020. We also announced plans to expand our Ohio Health joint venture to include outpatient services and announced a partnership with UC San Diego Health to open both a Critical Illness Recovery hospital and a new rehab hospital in the San Diego market.\nThe UC San Diego Critical Illness Recovery Hospital joint venture opened earlier this year and we expect construction on the rehab hospital to commence later this year. Additionally, we expect to open our new 50-bed rehab hospital in partnership with University of Florida System in Gainesville later this quarter. We also have new rehabilitation hospitals under construction in Las Vegas in partnership with Dignity Health, scheduled to open in the second quarter and in Newport News Virginia in partnership with Riverside Health scheduled to open in the third quarter.\nOur development pipeline remains robust. For the fourth quarter, we had a 15.6% year-over-year growth in revenue and an 18% growth in adjusted EBITDA, which included double-digit growth in both our outpatient rehab and Concentra business segments. Cash flow from operation was, again, very strong in this quarter, generating over $113 million and we repaid an additional $45 million of Select's revolving debt during the quarter and $210 million during the year.\nI will now take you through our operational metrics for the fourth quarter and the full year. Overall, our net revenue for the fourth quarter increased by $170 million to $1.26 billion, which included top line growth in each of our four business segments. For the full year, net revenue increased 16.4% to almost $5.1 billion. Net revenue in our Critical Illness Recovery hospital segment in the fourth quarter increased slightly to $426 million. The increase was driven by a 1.5% improvement in rate to $1,717 per patient day in the fourth quarter.\nOccupancy in our Critical Illness Recovery Hospital segment was 66% in the fourth quarter compared to 65% in the same quarter last year. Our patient days and admissions both declined slightly compared to the same quarter last year, driven by the four hospitals we closed during the year as well as our damaged hospital in Panama City. Excluding the hospitals that were closed, patient days would have increased 1.7% in the quarter.\nFor the year, net revenue on our Critical Illness Recovery Hospital segment increased $28.6 million to $1.75 billion compared to last year. Despite an increase in the number of facilities -- despite a decrease in the number of facilities we operated, patient days and admissions both increased slightly for the year with occupancy at 67% this year compared to 66% last year.\nNet revenue per patient day was $1,716 for the year compared to $1,704 last year. Net revenue in our Rehab Hospital segment in the fourth quarter increased 7.9% to $182 million compared to $169 million in the same quarter last year. Patient days increased 10.9% to almost 82,000 patient days compared to 74,000 days in the same quarter last year.\nNet revenue per patient day was $1,610 in the fourth quarter compared to $1,639 per day in the same quarter last year. The decline in net revenue per patient day was primarily driven by reduction in our Medicare rate at our California Rehab hospital. For the year, net revenue in our Rehab Hospital segment increased 13.7% to $708 million compared to $622 million last year.\nThe primary driver of the revenue growth was the growth driven in our patient days, which increased 16.9% to over 315,000 patient days compared to 270,000 days last year. The increase in patient days was primarily driven by maturation of the hospitals we opened in 2016 and 2017. Our net revenue per patient day for the year was $1,606 compared to $1,577 last year. The increase in net revenue per patient day was primarily related to an increase in non-Medicare net revenue per patient day. Net revenue in our Outpatient Rehab segment in the fourth quarter increased 8% to $272 million compared to $252 million in the same quarter last year.\nPatient visits increased 2% to 2.1 million visits in the fourth quarter compared to 2.06 million visits in the same quarter last year. During 2018, we sold several clinics to non-consolidating joint ventures with Banner Health and our Baylor joint venture. Excluding the effects of those clinic sales, visits would have increased 5.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year.\nOur net revenue per visit was $103 in the fourth quarter compared to $102 per visit in the same quarter last year. For the year, net revenue in our Outpatient Rehab segment increased 5.8% to $1.06 billion compared to $1 billion last year. Net revenue per visit was $103 per visit this year compared to $101 last year. The increase in net revenue per visit is a result of improved contracted rate with some of our payers. Visits increased 1.5% to 8.36 million visits, compared to 8.23 million visits last year.\nThe overall increase in visits resulted from new start as well as acquired clinics. Again, excluding the effects of the clinics we sold to non-consolidated joint ventures, visits would have increased 5.1% compared to last year.\nWe also had an increase in revenues related to management fees and contracted labor services provided to our non-consolidated joint ventures in both the fourth quarter and the full year comparative periods.\nNet revenue in our Concentra segment for the fourth quarter increased 53.8% to $384 million compared to $250 million in the same quarter last year, which was primarily driven by the contribution of U.S. Healthworks.\nFor the fourth quarter revenue from our centers was $349 million and the balance of approximately $35 million was generated from on-site clinics, community-based outpatient clinics and other services.\nFor the centers, we had patient visits of $2.82 million -- visits of 2.82 million and net revenue per visit of $124 in the fourth quarter. This compares to 1.86 million visits and $117 per visit in the same quarter last year.\nFor the year, net revenue in our Concentra segment increased 53.7% to $1.56 billion compared to $1.01 billion last year. The addition of U.S. Healthworks on February 1 of this year was the primary reason for the increase.\nVisits in our centers increased 48.2% to 11.4 million visits compared to 7.7 million visits last year. Revenue per visit was $124 this year, compared to $115 per visit last year. The increase in revenue per visits is primarily related to U.S. Healthworks as well as an increase in worker's compensation, employer services reimbursement rates in our existing Concentra centers.\nTotal company-adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter increased 18% to $147.1 million compared to $124.6 million in the same quarter last year with consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin at 11.6% for the fourth quarter compared to 11.4% same quarter last year.\nFor the year, total adjusted EBITDA increased 19.9% to $645.2 million compared to $538 million last year with consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin at 12.7% for the year compared to 12.3% last year.\nFor our Critical Illness Recovery Hospital segment, adjusted EBITDA was $56 million in the fourth quarter compared to $58.4 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was 13.1% in the fourth quarter, compared to 13.8% in the same quarter last year.\nOur adjusted EBITDA and margin were impacted by changes in other operating expenses relative to our net operating revenues during the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year. For the year, Critical Illness Recovery Hospital segment adjusted EBITDA was $243 million compared to $252.7 million last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 13.9% compared to 14.6% last year. Adjusted EBITDA and margin were both impacted by increases in employee costs and other operating expense this year compared to last year.\nOur Rehabilitation Hospital segment adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the fourth quarter to $28.6 million compared to $28 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Rehab Hospital segment was 15.7% in the fourth quarter compared to 16.6% in the same quarter last year. For the year, our rehab hospital adjusted EBITDA increased 21% to $108.9 million compared to $90 million last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 15.4% compared to 14.5% last year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin were primarily related to the maturation of the hospitals we opened in 2016 and 2017 as well as increase in net revenue per day I previously mentioned.\nAdjusted EBITDA losses in our start-up hospitals were $4.7 million this year compared to $7.5 million last year.\nOutpatient rehab adjusted EBITDA increased 16.8% to $35 million in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $30 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the outpatient segment was 12.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 11.9% in the same quarter last year.\nFor the year, outpatient rehab adjusted EBITDA increased 7.1% to $142 million compared to $132.5 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.4% compared to 13.2% last year. The growth in adjusted EBITDA and margin for both the fourth quarter and the full year was a result of increase in payment visits and the rate increase I previously mentioned.\nConcentra adjusted EBITDA was $52.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $31.9 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 12.8% in the same quarter last year.\nFor the year Concentra adjusted EBITDA was $252 million compared to $157.6 million last year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily the result of the acquisition of U.S. HealthWorks.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for the Concentra segment was 16.2% this year compared to 15.6% last year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin for both the fourth quarter and the full year was the result of lower relative operating costs across the combined Concentra/U.S. HealthWorks businesses.\nEarnings per fully diluted share was $0.18 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.75 in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per fully diluted share was $0.20 per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter compared to $0.32 in the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted earnings per fully diluted share excludes the pre-tax losses on early retirement debt and its related tax effects in the fourth quarter this year. During the fourth quarter last year, adjusted earnings per share excluded U.S. HealthWorks acquisition costs and related tax effects as well as the income tax benefits resulting from federal tax reform legislation.\nEarnings per fully diluted share was $1.02 for the year compared to $1.33 last year. Adjusted earnings per fully diluted share was $1.03 per fully diluted share for the year compared to $0.98 last year.\nAdjusted earnings per fully diluted share excludes the pre-tax losses on our early retirement debt, non-operating gains, U.S. HealthWorks acquisition costs, and the related tax effects for the year.\nLast year adjusted earnings per share excluded the loss on early retirement debt, U.S. HealthWorks acquisition costs, and related tax effects, as well as the income tax benefit resulting from the federal tax reform legislation.\nI'll now turn it over to Marty Jackson for some additional financial details before opening the call up for questions.\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Bob. Good morning everyone. For the fourth quarter, our operating expenses, which include our cost of services and general and administrative expenses, were $1.1 billion.

For the year, we recognized $14.2 million of losses on early retirement of debt.\nWe also recognized non-operating gains of $9 million during the year, primarily -- this was primarily related to the sale of outpatient clinics to Banner and Baylor JV that Bob mentioned. Last year we recognized a loss on early retirement of debt $19.7 million.\nInterest expense was $50.5 million in the fourth quarter. This compares to $38.5 million in the same quarter last year. Interest expense for the year was $198.5 million. This compares to $154.7 million last year.

And at this time, we'd like to turn it back to the operator to open up the call for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nFrank Morgan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGood morning. Thanks for the clarification there on the LTACH volumes when you pulled out those divestitures. But I'm curious 1.7% growth which is effective for that same-store number if I understood you correctly. So just wanted to get a little more color on how you see growth going into the year? And maybe talk a little bit about what's implied in your guidance there? So, I guess, a two-part question.\nHow is the uptake in those local markets going with patient criteria and the ability to attract those patients? And then what's the implied growth in your guidance with regard to the LTACH segment?\nRobert A. Ortenzio -- Executive Chairman & Co-Founder\nThanks for the question Frank. The guidance moving forward is we assume we have 96 LTACHs and we'll continue to have 96 LTACHs through the -- through all of 2019. There is no -- we did not increase any LTACHs during 2019.\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nIn terms of what our prospect is Frank in terms of how we're doing, I think that when you have as many hospitals as we do across as many states and local communities. I think we're generally pleased. I mean, we have some hospitals that are just going phenomenally well and are at the very high-end of our expectations. And then we obviously have a group that because of the nuances of the local market driving the census to back up to pre-criteria levels is we take a little bit more time, it's a little bit more difficult. So I think the biggest takeaway I can give you is that it's not even across our portfolio of critical illness hospitals. It's decidedly uneven when we have some hospitals that are doing phenomenally well and some of our hospitals that were great are just now good, and some of the ones that we were struggling with are doing much better. So it's a little bit of uneven. But we're still pretty optimistic that the portfolio of hospitals that we have is the right one and that over time we'll be able to drive the occupancies back up to pre-criteria levels.\nFrank Morgan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGot you. And Marty I think you called out in terms of your discussions about margins at some other operating expense line items that was one of the factors in the margin pressure there, could you give us any color there?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Frank. Actually, I think the -- with the volume decline, I think, the operators did a very good job controlling expenses. If you take a look at expenses on a year-over-year basis they were up about 1.4% or $5 million for the quarter. The issue was really the line being down.\nFrank Morgan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGot you. And I'm guessing that other operating expenses are probably more semi-fixed, so you probably couldn't change as much as but -- OK. Just, since we're talking about the guidance, just any other general assumptions that you're baking in there? Whether it's timing of openings of LTACs or start-up losses and tax rate?\nAnd then finally just on Concentra, I think, I know this, but I just want to hear you say it, in terms of any seasonality you're seeing in that business on a sequential basis that's up?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Let me address your last question first and that is the seasonality associated with Concentra. I mean, Concentra, the fourth quarter is always a down quarter for them and you can go back over the years and you'll see that first, second quarters are -- the margins are north of -- since we've had it, north of 15%. And you'll always see in that fourth quarter a drop. So we should make sure that all the analysts kind of build that into their model moving forward. Now, Frank, remind me of the first question you asked?\nFrank Morgan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYes. Just some more general assumptions around your guidance in areas like openings or maybe timing of openings, amount of start-up losses you expect and the same tax rate in the year? That's it.\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes. The tax rates, we anticipate it's about 25% for the year. Openings, we do not anticipate any openings on the LTAC side. And with regards to the inpatient rehab, we should have one hospital opening, our Dignity Hospital should be opening in second quarter of the year. And then Shands, which is the University of Florida, will be opening by the end of this quarter.\nFrank Morgan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAnd start -- your implied start-up losses, you're about $900,000 in this pretty good quarter?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes. There's going to probably be -- for those hospitals, I would anticipate somewhere in the neighborhood of $2 million to $3 million of start-up losses per hospital.\nFrank Morgan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks. I'll hop back in the queue.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nPeter Costa -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nGood morning, Bob and Marty. So many things going well. The only thing that's been a little slower seems to be the improvement in the LTACs and you did get the occupancy up 1% year-over-year. But how much of more can you do in a year? Is it going to be something that's going to be sort of 1% per year? Or do you think you can do better than that? And what is it that's holding you back in those markets that you talked about being a little bit slower? Is it competition or is it an education process of either the clinical staff or the administrators?\nRobert A. Ortenzio -- Executive Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Pete, thanks for the question. I think you hit the nail on the hand. It really is an educational process. Remember that, as you go after these compliant patients, the complaint patients are actually in the short-term acute-term hospitals. And it's really just modifying their discharge, their historical discharging patterns.\nWe've got a -- our people continue to do a great job, I think, educating our referral sources and that's just going to take time. So, I think in terms of occupancy rate increases, I think, the 1% a year is probably a good assumption.\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes, I would say that it would be definitely not competition. I mean as a general statement. I mean with the change over to the new criteria which as you know we're taking the LTACH-compliant patients exclusively. The high acuity of these patients and the fact that they're coming out of the intensive care units of the general acute care hospitals just makes the process in some markets slower.\nThe -- you have to demonstrate that you have the clinical wherewithal to take care of some really involved acute patients. And in most of our markets, we have all those relationships and the transition of patients is very smooth.\nIn others, we have work to do. We get some group of those patients and others, we have to work harder through education and providing the clinical programs that enable physicians and discharge planners to be -- feel comfortable that it's a good, safe environment for their high acuity patients. And so that's the process. And in many of our hospitals, we're there and we have a cohort that we just need keep working on.\nPeter Costa -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nAnd is it educating the clinical staff more or is it educating the administrators to get the referrals?\nRobert A. Ortenzio -- Executive Chairman & Co-Founder\nI think it's -- I think for these patients, it's more of the clinical staff.\nPeter Costa -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nAnd you spiked out the employee cost on the critical illness recovery hospital as being one of the contributors to some of the weakness. How much of that is just raises -- pay raises versus having more staff on board trying to get ready for more patient volume?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nIt really -- Pete, it really is a question of the annual increases to the staff.\nRobert A. Ortenzio -- Executive Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, it's more of the former. The latter that you've mentioned is really did and done and we prepared for that going into criteria. So, it's very much the former. I mean this is just -- the critical illness hospitals is just a difficult venue for clinicians to work taking care of this population of patients. It's very tough work and it's hard to recruit into that area, it's hard to retain in an area in a time when there's nursing shortages. So, it's very competitive for staff out there and I think that's what's driving it.\nPeter Costa -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nAnd do you think that's getting worse or getting better as we go forward?\nRobert A. Ortenzio -- Executive Chairman & Co-Founder\nI would say the same. Although it is different depending on the geography and depending on the market that you're in. But I don't think we see it getting worse. I think we see it kind of -- I don't know that we would characterize it as getting better at this point, but certainly probably not getting worse.\nPeter Costa -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nThanks. Appreciate the time.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nHi thanks. First of all let me ask about the Concentra U.S. HealthWorks business. As you anniversary that I think in the first quarter of this year, what is sort of the combined organic growth that you would look for that business to generate on the topline if you don't have?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes A.J. as -- I think you've got it correctly that the acquisition took place February 1 of last year. So first quarter you'll see a little bit of a -- you'll see January of 2019 really be that -- we won't anniversary I guess. What I'm trying to say is we won't anniversary until the second quarter, because it was acquired in February 1 of 2018. The top line organic growth that we see is probably in the 2% to 3% range.\nA.J. Rice -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. When I look at -- I guess also for this year in your guidance you have one quarter of this new care tool that the IRF business is going to have to be impacted by. I know it's not a huge business in your overall mix, but I wondered are you assuming sort of status quo with that transition or is that a headwind? How would you describe, what your view is on that at this point?\nRobert A. Ortenzio -- Executive Chairman & Co-Founder\nWe're assuming status quo. We are not anticipating that as a headwind.\nA.J. Rice -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. And then on the interest expense guidance I guess in the fourth quarter you're running about $50.5 million of interest as you mentioned in your prepared remarks Martin. And you've got I thinking a guidance of $200 million. I know there's various things going on in there. But I wondered how much of your debt at this point -- I know you mentioned the trenches I don't know if you got any of that hedged I'm assuming you probably do. How much of your debt is floating-rate or what are you assuming about that? And then is there any assumption about the ability to call or refinance anything that might impact the interest calculation to go behind that $200 million?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes A.J. We're good with the $200 million. The expectation is that we will pay down some debt over the next year. With regards to what the composition of our debt is, we have our senior notes at 6.38 which are fixed and the balance of our debt is floating. In our guidance, we assumed that LIBOR would be in that 2.75% -- we're going a 1-month LIBOR we assumed it would be 2.75% to 3%.\nA.J. Rice -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay I might just slip one last one in. You mentioned the Panama City's situation in your prepared remarks was that immaterial to consolidated results or did that -- was that a drag in the fourth quarter in any way and will it be a drag in the early part of 2019?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nIt was certainly a drag in the fourth quarter. The Panama City on an annualized basis on EBITDA does around $5 million. And I think we incurred a loss in the fourth quarter of about $700,000, $800,000.\nA.J. Rice -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nAnd are you just assuming that persists for 2019? Or are you assuming that some point you get it up and running?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We don't think that Panama City will come back on board probably until the fourth quarter of 2019.\nA.J. Rice -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nAll right. Thanks a lot.\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, A.J.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Patrick Feeley with Barclays. Your line is open.\nPatrick Feeley -- Barclays -- Analyst\nHey, good morning everyone. Just a follow-up on that question. Do you expect any insurance recoveries for Panama City to come in?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes, we do. Yeah, I mean under the business interruption, portion of our insurance policy, we expect that to come in play. We probably won't realize that, again until the third or fourth quarter of 2019.\nPatrick Feeley -- Barclays -- Analyst\nOkay. And just my other question on the outpatient rehab side. First on some of the issues in Physio you experienced in the past. Can you just give us an update on where you stand with replacing some of those therapists you lost post-acquisition? Has that stabilized by now? And the other question -- I'll let you answer that and come back with the follow-up.\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nSure. The Physio integration, we think that the -- our operators have done a great job, and you can see that in the past couple of quarters. You can see the improvement that's been made, and for all intents and purposes, yes the Physio been fully integrated and we're comfortable with where we are right now.\nPatrick Feeley -- Barclays -- Analyst\nGreat. And the other question on the outpatient rehab. The other revenue bucket, while it's not terribly material, it's been up pretty materially 20% or so. Can you just comment on what's driving that? What's in that bucket? Is that primarily management fee revenue from the non-consolidated JVs driving that? Just any color there? And how to think about that for 2019? Thanks.\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, there is -- you're absolutely right. That is going up as we continue to do more JVs and some of those JVs are non-consolidating. There's two primary components that are in that. That is as you pointed out the management fees, but there is also a line item called -- we do a labor pass-through. And both of those categories as we can -- as -- actually we did the Banner and the Ohio health deal, and also the Baylor. Those are all non-consolidating for us. So that's why you see the big increase on that line item.\nPatrick Feeley -- Barclays -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks very much.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open,\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks. I wanted to go back to the LTAC margins. I guess, you guys closed four sites year-over-year. I would have thought that might have helped boost the margin profile for some of their underperforming sites? Many of the margins were down year-over-year, I don't know if there is any other color you can provide there?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Kevin. The four hospitals that we closed those were hospitals where the lease was coming up and when you take a look at the marketplaces there wasn't -- when we take a look at five years out, we thought that there just wasn't a sufficient EBITDA increases to continue the five-year lease. All four of -- I think at least three of those four were actually generating positive EBITDA. But it was moderate EBITDA.\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nYeah, so but I guess still that we're probably implied that your margins were benefited year-over-year by not having them in the same-store number, or in the consolidated number, I should say?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, it's -- if we want to talk basis points, I'll have to get back to you on that. I don't -- it's immaterial actually.\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay. And then, I guess your margins were down year-over-year even though on a same-store basis, you were growing volumes 1.7% and you said that going forward you expect 1% to be the right number as a starting point. And if the labor environment is not getting better, does your guidance assume that LTAC margins were down again in 2019?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nI want to make sure, we're talking about the same thing. The 1% that we were talking about was 1% occupancy rate, right? So I want to make sure that the percentages that we're talking about are -- it's an apples-to-apples comparison.\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay. But I guess in this quarter your occupancy was up at 1% right?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes.\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nAnd as for you talking about going forward and I guess, I'm just trying to figure out if it sounds like, you're saying, it's a bit similar volume growth in the future is what you saw here similar to wage growth as you saw here? And obviously margins were down so I just was trying to understand if you're assuming the margin will be down in 2019 or if this somewhat offset on rates or something else, costs?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nWell I think if you like at the -- well the rate was up in the fourth quarter, the rate was up $26 what was down was Case Mix Index. And Case Mix Index represents about a $26 differential. We think we should be in that 1.25 to 1.26 range. We're at 1.22. That comes back to 1.25, 1.26, we'll be fine.\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay. And then I guess with -- on the IRF side, the margins were down even though start-up losses were down. I guess I think if you take out the start-up losses and EBITDA, wouldn't have grown at all, it actually would've been down a little bit. So what is the -- is something going on there to which we think...\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nWell I think Bob had mentioned we had an impact from the California Rehab Institute where the Medicare rate was down. We had an interim -- we had Interim Medicare rate in Q4 of 2017 that was because of the start-up nature of that hospital that -- the rate actually in -- Q4 of 2018 was lower than what it was in 2017. So that had a negative impact, as well as two hospitals we had, we had some softness in volume. And that really -- the two hospitals that were same store.\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nAnd how do we think about that California rate dynamic? Is that something that was -- still going to be a headwind year-over-year for the next couple of quarters or was that just a onetime thing in Q4 and the comps are normal going forward?\nMartin F. Jackson -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nYes. No, we're -- it was the fourth quarter rate impact. So we will be fine going forward.\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay, all right. Great, thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today.
