Adobe delivered record revenue in our second quarter with strong financial results. Q2 revenue was $2.2 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.33 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.66.\nAdobe enables individuals, companies, governments, and educational institutions to design and deliver transformative digital experiences, immersive intelligent experiences that inspire, entertain, and drive loyalty and growth. The breadth of our product portfolio, the deep science embedded in our Adobe Cloud platform, the insights derived from the trillions of data transactions we process every year on behalf of our customers, and our global ecosystem of partners and developers have made Adobe the leader in enabling great customer experiences.\nIn our digital media business, we achieved strong growth in both Creative and Document Cloud revenue in Q2. We added net new digital media, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, of $343 million, which grew total digital media ARR exiting Q2 to $6.06 billion. We continue to drive steady adoption of Creative Cloud subscriptions and services by individuals, teams, and enterprises across all segments and geographies. This resulted in another strong quarter for Creative Cloud, with Creative revenue growing to $1.3 billion.\nAt Adobe, we believe everyone has a story to tell. Our strategy to empower more of the world's storytellers to express themselves depends on our ability to make our tools more accessible, enjoyable, and invaluable to a broader set of creative customers, from creative pros to hobbyists to young creators.\nExperience Design is one of our fastest growing Creative segments and we recently introduced a new start-up plan for Adobe XD, our all-in-one UX/UI design platform. Adobe XD is the most modern, cloud-based solution available for designing, prototyping, and collaborating with colleagues across multiple platforms. We recently announced several new integrations between XD and designers existing workflows inside of tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator. We launched a $10 million design investment fund to support designers and developers who innovate and push the boundaries of experience design.\nEnabling creativity in the Education segment remains a passion for Adobe. Adobe Spot Premium, our application for everyday communicators to transform their ideas into beautiful, visual stories is now available to every student globally. We have achieved strong adoption of Spark in school districts across the nation. To further bolster our commitment to K-12 students, we introduced a new offering that gives students more affordable access to applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier Pro, and XD. These actions are part of our commitment to partner with educators, promote Steam, and ensure art and creativity remain an essential part of education and professional development.\nAdobe's video editing and production tools, including Adobe Premier Pro and After Effects, are the gold standard for creating films and video from the silver screen to the mobile screen. At NAB, Adobe unveiled innovative updates to Creative Cloud's digital video tools. In addition, partners including Canon, Red Cameras, AMD, and Sony announced tools and updates that allow users to work in an integrated, collaborative production environment.\nOur mission is to push the limits of creativity and storytelling while supporting exciting new mediums. We provided a sneak peak of Project Aero, a powerful new augmented reality, or AR authoring tool, at Apple's WWDC last week. Project Aero is a system that makes it easier for designers and developers to create immersive content and bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. With close to 1 billion AR-enabled devices expected to be in market next year, AR can drive a new wave of digital transformation and creativity.\nIn addition to the world's best desktop and mobile tools, Creative Cloud services are driving growth in our business, while offering new ways to inspire our customers and accelerate their creative process. Adobe Stock achieved record revenue in the quarter, with greater than 25% year-over-year growth. Adobe Stock now has a library of more than 100 million images, videos, and creative assets, including new [inaudible] -rated HD and 4K videos, as well as motion graphics templates.\nAdobe Document Cloud is the world's leading digital document service enabling individuals and businesses to digitize inefficient paper-based processes. In Q2, we achieved record revenue for Document Cloud of $243 million. Document Cloud subscriptions and Acrobat perpetual licensing drove 22% year-over-year revenue growth and 47 in net new Document Cloud ARR.\nThis week makes the 25th anniversary of Acrobat and PDF. The innovation that ushered in the era of digital documents. 25 years later, the pace at which we are innovating with Document Cloud has only accelerated, as digital documents become more collaborative and mobile. More than 800 million PDFs are opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader on mobile devices each month. Adobe Scan, our mobile PDF creation app, powered by Adobe Sensei, that turns your phone or tablet into a scanning and text recognition tool, has been downloaded more than 10 million times.\nAdobe Sign, our digital signature solution for Document Cloud, continues to have strong momentum. Today, over have of Fortune 100 companies use Adobe Sign. Last September, we teamed up with Microsoft to integrate Adobe Sign into Microsoft Office 365. Next week, we'll be unveiling industry-first innovations in Adobe Sign focused on delivering superior digital document experiences to millions of customers.\nAdobe Experience Cloud is the most comprehensive, integrated, and actionable set of solutions in the market, designed to help companies deliver consistent, continuous, and compelling experiences across every touch point and channel. In Q2, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million and strong bookings across Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud, and Adobe Advertising Cloud. Key customer deals in the quarter included Audible, Intuit, Shell, H&R Block, Japan Airlines, PNC Bank, and Samsung.\nIn May, we announced our intent to acquire Magento, a leading commerce platform. Commerce is an integral part of an end-to-end customer experience, as consumers and businesses now expect every interaction to be shoppable. The addition of Magento commerce will enable commerce to be seamlessly integrated into Adobe Experience Cloud, delivering a single platform that serves both B2B and B2C customers globally, while providing the flexibility to scale to serve mid-market and large enterprise customers.\nThe Magento platform is supported by a robust community of more than 300,000 developers in a partner ecosystem that provides thousands of pre-built extensions, including payment, shipping, tax, and logistics. The acquisition of Magento will make Adobe the only company with leadership in content creation, marketing, advertising, analytics, and now commerce, enabling real-time personalized experiences across the entire customer journey, whether on the web, mobile, social, in-product, or in-store.\nWe believe the addition of Magento expands our available market opportunity, builds out our product portfolio, and addresses a key underserved customer need. When combined with our world-class content and data platform and leveraging our Sensei machine learning and AI framework, this latest capability will further differentiate Adobe Experience Cloud as the leading platform for experience businesses. We expect the acquisition to close next week.\nWe continue to hold successful customer summits across the globe, where we roll out new innovations across Adobe Experience Cloud, including major enhancements to the Adobe Cloud platform. Recent advancements include a new, unified customer profile that combines data across an enterprise, intelligent services, and general data protection registration, or GDPR readiness, all aimed at solving key challenges facing marketers, data scientists, and developers.\nAdobe was once again recognized for our Leadership and Technology segments that help to deliver and orchestrate experiences across the entire customer journey. We were named a leader in the Forrester Wave, digital asset management for customer experience, achieving the highest score for current offering of the vendor leaders. Adobe was positioned as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for multi-channel marketing hubs.\nIn this inaugural report, Adobe had the strongest ranking for completeness of vision among the 21 vendors evaluated. Adobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, forms the framework of the innovative Adobe Magic, across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. We were pleased to be recognized again as one of the world's most innovative companies by Forbes for 2018.\nThe talent and passion of our more than 18,000 employees worldwide continues to be the catalyst for Adobe's success. We take pride in making Adobe one of the world's best workplaces and cultivating a diverse and innovative team of global employees. This summer, we're pleased to welcome over 1,000 interns and university graduates to Adobe, the largest such group in company history.\nAdobe has the right strategy, partners, products, and people in place to win. We look forward to building on the momentum we're driving across our entire business and expect a strong second half of the year. John?\nJohn Murphy -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Shantanu. In the second quarter of FY18, Adobe's momentum continued with record revenue of $2.2 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.33, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.66. We drove strong performance across our product offerings and geographies during the quarter.\nHighlights in Q2 included record digital media revenue, including Creative revenue of $1.3 billion, and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $243 million. Record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million, net new digital media ARR of $343 million, and exiting Q2 with $5.37 billion of Creative ARR.\nDeferred revenue growth of 27% you, cash flow from operations of $976 million, returning $589 million of cash to our stockholders through stock buy-back, and approximately 89% of our revenue in Q2 was from recurring sources. In digital media, we grew segment revenue by 28% year-over-year. The addition of $343 million net new digital ARR during the quarter drew the total to $6.06 billion exiting Q2.\nWithin digital media, we achieved another record quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 29% year-over-year in Q2, and we increased Creative ARR by $296 million. Several key factors helped drive this growth, including strong net new subscriptions across user segments and geographies, helped by robust traffic and conversion on adobe.com, continued momentum with Creative Cloud adoption in emerging markets, stable or increasing RPU across key offerings, which continues to be driven by retention of users on promotional prices migrating to standard prices, as well as attachment of services in the enterprise, and the recently introduced price increase in the North America, and strong growth with Adobe Stock.\nWith Document Cloud, we achieved record revenue of $243 million, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. The performance in Q2 was driven by continued momentum with Acrobat subscription adoption, as well as strength in the enterprise with Acrobat and Document Cloud services. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million, which represents 18% year-over-year revenue growth.\nSubscription revenue grew 24% year-over-year. Experience Cloud performance in Q2 was driven by success across our Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Advertising Cloud offerings. Experience Cloud data transactions grew to 97 trillion in the quarter, with 60% of analytics transactions driven by mobile device usage. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $15.2 million. We had $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY18 versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q1 of FY18. Thus, the net sequential currency include to revenue considering hedging gains was $14.5 million.\nFrom a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $51.3 million. We had $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY18 versus $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 of FY17. Thus, the net year-over-year increase currency to revenue considering hedging gains was $38.3 million.\nIn Q2, Adobe's effective tax rate was 4% on a GAAP basis and 5% on a non-GAAP basis. These rates are below the targets we provided due to a structural change we made during Q2 and how we serve foreign customers based on the new U.S. Tax Act. Our recent international tax structure change will benefit our tax rates for the remainder of FY18, as well as next year. Our Trade DSO was 44 days, which compared to 46 days in the year-ago quarter and 47 days last quarter.\nDeferred revenue grew to a record $2.63 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $6.33 billion. Cash flow for operations was $976 million in the quarter. In Q2, we repurchased approximately $2.6 million shares at a cost of $589 million. We currently have $900 million remaining of our $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017. We expect this authorization to be exhausted by the end of this fiscal year. On May 21, we announced that our Board had authorized an incremental $8 billion share repurchase program through Fiscal Year 2021, which will be funded from future cash flow generation.\nNow, we'll provide our financial outlook. In January, we updated our financial targets to reflect provisions of the new U.S. Tax Act which became law during our Fiscal Q1. The Tax Act affords companies like Adobe the ability to make changes to the way we serve our foreign customers with our international corporate structure.\nDuring Q2, we made a structural change and the effect of it results in even lower tax rates than we discussed previously for both this year and subsequent fiscal years. In Fiscal 2018, we anticipate an incremental 6 percentage point reduction in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates when compared to the rates we provided in January. We are now expecting a GAAP tax rate of approximately 7% in Q3 and Q4 of Fiscal 2018, and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 5% in Q3 and Q4 of Fiscal 2018.\nOur November fiscal year calendar and the timing of certain Tax Act provisions make our FY18 a unique year from a tax rate perspective. We indicated in January that we anticipated our tax rate would stabilize at a new rate of approximately 18% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis in FY19. Based on the structural change we made in Q2, we now estimate our tax rates in FY19 will stabilize and GAAP and non-GAAP rates of approximately 14%.\nTurning to Q3 FY18, we are targeting revenue of approximately $2.240 billion, Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%, Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 15%, tax rate of approximately 7% on a GAAP basis, and 5% on a non-GAAP basis, share count of approximately 498 million shares, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.27, non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.68, and net new digital media ARR of approximately $310 million.\nOur Q3 targets do not reflect our pending acquisition of Magento Commerce. We have received regulatory clearance and anticipate closing the acquisition next week. For the second half of calendar year 2018, Magento's internal plan projected achieving approximately $100 million in revenue. After the transition to Adobe's November fiscal calendar and the writedown of deferred revenue due to purchase accounting rules, we anticipate Adobe will report approximately $40 million of Magento revenue in the second half of Adobe's Fiscal 2018, with approximately $10 million of it in our Fiscal Q3. We expect the closing of Magento to be slightly dilutive to our Q3 GAAP earnings per share target. We do not expect the closing to impact our non-GAAP Q3 earnings per share target.\nIn Q4, we anticipate normal seasonal strength and a strong finish to the year. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.\nMike Saviage -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nThanks, John.

We would now be happy to take your questions and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nThanks. Hi, guys. Looking at the results, the revenue in Digital Media both in the quarter and for the outlook is better than expected, despite the Digital Media ARR coming in line. I'm wondering if there's something that's improving the revenue conversion in the quarters or some other factor that's allowing that to happen?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSterling, I'll take that. I think as we look at Digital Media, as you pointed out, ARR was again strong across all different segments. Retention continues to be in line with expected. Acrobat perpetual had a good quarter, so you know Acrobat as it related to both licensing and perpetual was strong, as well as Stock. So, I think, you know, across the board we continue to focus on converting ARR to revenue.\nSterling Auty -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the Experience Cloud business, clearly showed some really nice acceleration in the quarter on a much tougher comp from last year. I wanted to ask what changes have you observed? What's strengthening renewal activity and upsell? Any comments would be helpful. And then how sustainable do you expect some of these trends to be?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAlex, big picture, I think we were very pleased with our performance in the experience business. I think the metric that we look at a lot was the subscription revenue growth. If you look at the subscription revenue growth in the quarter, that was 24% year-over-year, I think in the prepared remarks said it was across the Marketing Cloud, Analytics Cloud, as well as the Advertising Cloud.\nAgain, digital transformation is front and center as an imperative for every single organization. Without a doubt, we have the clear leadership position in that. The value proposition is very unique. We're getting larger deals. We've talked about the multi-solution opportunities that we have. I would say particularly in the quarter as well, with the two summits that we organized and the interest that we have in summits as closing opportunities for us.\nLast but not least, the partnership with Microsoft, where we're jointly going in and engaging with customers at higher levels. I'll just point to continued leadership on the product and vision side and focus on execution in the quarter.\nAlex Zukin -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nThank you, guys.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks. Shani, just following up on Digital Experience. The first half of the year, you actually outpaced your year-end growth rate target and you have easier comps in the back half of this year. I'm just curious in terms of, why not take up your aspirations there? Is there something that's worrying you in the second half? Obviously, you'll have Magento layer in as well. Are you just kind of waiting for that to layer in before you update your aspirations there?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think in terms of overall, as you know, Brent, we do not update our full-year guidance at this point. We are coming into what has been the Q3 seasonal quarter in Europe, but the interest and the excitement or aspirations haven't diminished in any way. As you point out, it was a strong quarter. We have, with Magento, even more of a comprehensive offering. So, we continue to remain excited. But I wouldn't read anything into it except for the fact that we did touch on the fact that Q4 will continue to be seasonally strong, so should proceed as expected.\nBrent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nJust a quick follow-up for John on RPU. I think last quarter you said RPU was kind of up across the board. I think now you're saying flat to up. Given the price increases, can you just maybe parse that? I know we're probably digging in on a metric that we're probably going too deep into. But any color there why that wouldn't be up and up like we saw in Q1?\nJohn Murphy -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI think what we said is that it's stable and we expect it to remain stable to up. I think it's really, from our perspective, a healthy metric. We don't guide to that or target externally, but it certainly contributes to our ARR.\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe just adding color, Brent, on that as it relates to the enterprise licensing. Nothing has changed as we see enterprise licensing. We're certainly seeing good adoption of the full offering from the customized versions that we had said. As it relates to the price, since you asked that question, we always expected it to be marginal in terms of the impact associated with that. We're pleased with what we have seen so far in terms of whether it's people buying new subscriptions or renewal, where people see the price increase. I think that's very much in line with the additional value that we've provided. On Digital Media, we continue to be excited about the opportunity.\nBrent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jennifer Low from UBS. Your line is open.\nJennifer Lowe -- UBS Securities -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you. I wanted to follow up a little bit on the subscription growth that you're seeing with Creative Cloud outside of the U.S. and, in particular, in geographies outside of the U.S. I guess maybe in two pieces. First, I think last year one of the talking points was that Japan and Germany were still relatively early in the transition from on prem to cloud. I'm curious if we have any update on the rate of the base migration there. Then related, as you think about subscriber growth in emerging markets, I'm curious if you have an update on how much of that is piracy conversion versus net new users to the base.\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Jennifer. I think globally when we look at the demand for the creative solutions and specifically the cloud offerings, I think we've stated that Japan and Germany and the other emerging markets were phase shifted from the United States and Australia, where we first introduced the offerings, all the learnings that we've had about how to acquire customers and convert them, whether they be new customers to the platform or, as you point out, former pirates, we have certainly learned from that.\nWe continue to think that the differential pricing that we have in countries like China, as well as Southeast Asia is helping us. There's more creativity in those markets. Japan and Germany net-net continue to be good areas of growth for us moving forward. The emerging markets, both the piracy, as well as the attractive up-front pricing are reasons why people are adopting the platform.\nJennifer Lowe -- UBS Securities -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nThank you very much. Congrats on a great quarter. Shantanu, can you share with us what the learnings have been from the price increase you introduced in North America this quarter and your observations on elasticity?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think, Brad, it's early. I would actually point to the learnings that we've had from the foreign exchange changes that have happened in other countries and as a result of that, what we have done with respect to pricing. Our strategy continues to be how do we get more and more people on the platform. So, we continue to attract new customers with attractive pricing. During the first year, the more engagement that we have with them, the more they are likely to add the standard pricing continue and renewal. So, renewal continues to be an area of focus for us. Again, the goal for us right now is attracting new customers to the platform. Everything we've done with respect to price changes has not impacted retention and so we continue to focus on that blend, if that makes sense.\nBrad Zelnick -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nIt does. Excellent, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital.\nSaket Kalia -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question. Shantanu, realizing that it still has to close, can you just talk about initial customer feedback on Magento? It's been a few weeks. Any early ideas, broad brushes that you could share with us on how the business can look different as a part of the Adobe family post-closing?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Saket. I think despite the fact that we already had integrations with commerce systems, we had clear asks from our customers for a complete Adobe solution from content creation, to delivery, to analytics, and now all the way out to commerce. What we are particularly excited about is the investment that we've made in the Adobe Cloud platform provides a clear architecture and a playbook for us to integrate new acquisitions like Magento seamlessly.\nWe were attracted by a few things when we looked at Magento. Great people, great technology. I think what's unique was that they targeted both digital and physical goods, as well as B2B and B2C in terms of the customer segments. Mark, who is their CEO, did a great job of leading them after they transitioned out of eBay.\nWhile their traditional strength has been in the mid-market and departments, or single geographies where large enterprises use them for commerce in one geography and then translate it, I think that will continue to be an area of good opportunity for us. What we will bring to that is the enterprise relationships that we have with larger enterprise. Like all our acquisitions, we look at it from the point of view of can we accelerate their growth? Does it fill out our offering? Do we have a unique and differentiated solution?\nThe good news was Magento, I think, checked all of those boxes. We're excited about it, as we said. Hopefully it closes next week and we'll give you some transparency into the size of their business.\nSaket Kalia -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. Thanks, Shantanu.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nMark Moerdler -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst\nCongrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. I'm going to follow up on the questions for Magento. Discuss how Magento has had strength in selling of the physical goods. Digital marketing is all about digital marketing but of both digital and electronic. How big a nuance, how big a difference is there, how big an opportunity is there in the fact that they are so strong in selling the physical goods and how does that play into the existing customer base that Adobe has in digital marketing?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nMark, I think from our point of view, we just want a very comprehensive solution. When you go into a retail customer, for example, with digital experience, who is making available for sale physical goods, we say yes, we have the ability for you to transact and finalize your sale for physical that's shipping. That doesn't mean that we are in shipping ourselves, but the ability to have that inventory, the biller materials, the payment methods, is clearly an advantage in terms of them taking non-digital way of transacting commerce and converting it to commerce.\nWhat's also nice about them is for people who want to do rooms or airline reservations or other digital ways of transacting business, the same solution scales from physical goods to digital goods. Things like subscriptions, what Adobe offers. I think we would all acknowledge that more and more companies want to get to a subscription mechanism. I think I would look at it more as a comprehensive way of dealing with anything that needs to be transacted online, whether the end results was a physical good, a digital good, a subscription.\nBeing able to have a comprehensive offering across B2B and B2C is really helpful. What I mean by B2B is you might have companies, whether they are consumer goods companies or companies that are actually shipping to other retailers who also want to use this to transact business electronically. That's what's exciting for us about what Magento offers.\nMark Moerdler -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst\nThat was very helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks and congrats on the quarter.\nJohn Murphy -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan of RBC. Your line is open.\nRoss MacMillan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks so much. Shantanu, congrats on the quarter. You look like you're tracking again this year to something around $1.3 billion of net new Digital Media ARR. We're just coming up into a period where you're starting to move on price. You have some new product introductions. There's some RPU effects from stock. Just philosophically, how do you think about the progress of that net new ARR? As we think about that, not just this year, but broadly speaking over the next two or three years? Do you feel like there are levers that you have to manage that number to a sort of target? I'm just trying to get a sense for sustainability on that line item. Thanks.\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Ross. Again, when we looked at the ARR accomplishment and the entire Digital Media performance in the first half, it's very clear that we continue to have momentum across all of the various offerings, as well as geographies. I think if you look at our Q3, and then I'll get to the big picture, we do expect Q3 is seasonally weak and we've said that we expect the traditional strength in Q4.\nOne of the things that we're just continuing to monitor in Q3 is what's happened with GDPR and the recent privacy law changes is that everybody who's doing business online in Europe will have to make sure that GDPR is not just a checklist item, but a new way of doing business which requires people to tailor their digital marketing. We were ready with that on May 25th. We just want to continue to monitor that as we transact business online. We are best-in-class both for ourselves, as well as for the service that we deliver for our customers.\nWe look at the $310 million target for ARR. It's the highest we've actually had in a Q3 for Digital Media. To your point, it should result in record ARR addition in this business for FY18. But long term, as you think about new media types, as you think about devices, what we are doing across education, immersive media opportunities with AR and VR, screen design, video and the explosion of video, I think you'll continue to see us innovate more, attract new customers to the platform and really drive the addressable opportunities. That's really the focus for us in that business.\nRoss MacMillan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nJust a quick follow-up if I can, for John. Welcome. Just on the tax rate, that new run rate of 14%. Is that something that in the absence of material geographic revenue mix shift or M&A, is that something that you would view as broadly a sort of stable run rate even beyond Fiscal '19?\nJohn Murphy -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Ross. How I would describe it is with the new Tax Act that we've been digesting the different impacts to that and so you see that we made this recent change, again, after just guiding in January. We do feel that this rate is stable, but we continue to evaluate opportunities with the provisions of the tax law. Just to remind you, our fiscal year '18 is a little unique for us. We don't have the full impacts of the Tax Act until FY19. But I think you can rely on those rates at this point to be relatively stable. As we continue to evaluate opportunities and take advantage of the provisions, we can update you then.\nRoss MacMillan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you. Congrats again.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer -- Griffin Securities -- Analyst\nThank you, good evening. Shantanu, a technology roadmap question for you regard Digital Experience. How much of a role do you think there may ultimately be for you to have a self-serve model in the portfolio in Digital Experience paralleling what you've done with Digital Media, particularly with Adobe.com? The reason I'm asking is was the launch of advertising Creative Cloud at summit, for instance, perhaps an early sign of a longer term ambition for more comprehensive self-serve capability that you can deliver to customers for Digital Experience? If that's so, would there then be positive incremental margin implications, as you've seen on the Digital Media side from that kind of a model?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think, Jay, there's no question that a focus on time-to-value and getting more practitioners adopting our Digital Experience solution sooner rather than later is a priority for us. We've certainly to your point done that with Acrobat and CC. Magento is a really nice addition to that because if people can create a website, start doing it with their customers through multiple channels and transact business through commerce, that opens up new vistas for us.\nIf you remember, the original day software, as well as what Omniture had actually targeted small and medium businesses. I look at is as are we focused on continuing to drive time-to-value and getting more practitioners to be self-serve? That's only a benefit in terms of their NPS with Adobe. It's clearly an area of focus for us.\nJay Vleeschhouwer -- Griffin Securities -- Analyst\nQuick one for John. Could you talk about the implications for cash flow from the new tax structure, both in terms of not just net income, which is obviously going to be affected on the GAAP side, but also perhaps in terms of deferred tax implications within cash flow?\nJohn Murphy -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nClearly, we benefit from the tax rate changes. I think what we've demonstrated is that our business continues to throw off great cash flow strength and growth. I would just say that trend is pretty consistent.\nJay Vleeschhouwer -- Griffin Securities -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open.\nWalter Pritchard -- Citi -- Analyst\nThanks. Just a further question around pricing. You've talked about services for some time and Stock I think continues to do well. Can you help us understand how services are impacting pricing versus some of these other factors, especially the price increase that just started having effect this quarter? Maybe a [inaudible] relative conversation about the drivers of RPU? Thanks.\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Walter. I think as it relates to Adobe Stock, that is a clear service. It makes the entire offering stickier. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that Stock had a very strong quarter. I think it continues to make the whole aspect of an [inaudible] to creativity easier, so that's been good. I would say in the enterprise, in particular, as people are finding that whether you're interfacing between freelancers and the marketing or graphics department within enterprises, storing all of these assets so that you can increase content velocity, things like Adobe Sign.\nAll of them are causing us to be able to both deliver better value and charge more to our enterprise customers. In the enterprises, in particular, we have very maniacally focused on named user deployment, ensuring more people use it within an enterprise, having services be the way in which they can engage more people in the creative process. That's leading to both greater RPU, as well as new seed deployment within the enterprise.\nWalter Pritchard -- Citi -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nHeather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nI just had a question about your, as you look at your revenue targets, Shantanu, and as you look out a few years, is there a reason to think that the pace of expense growth which we've been seeing would change at all? You guys have done such a great job growing expenses at such a lower pace obviously than revenue. I'm just wondering is there any reason to think that the pace of what we've seen in terms of expense growth would change based on what your revenue plans might be down the road?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThat's a great question, Heather, in terms of how we think about it. I think as a company we're just being ruthlessly focused on both top line and bottom line growth. When you are driving 24% year-over-year growth and revenue, while driving 60+% growth in non-GAAP EPS, I think it shows that we're really focused on both of those.\nWe just have some very significant opportunities and I think as you think about Q2, maybe there were a couple of investments in the Adobe Cloud platform, as well as in preparation for GDPR that were factored in. But I think long-term we just continue to ensure that we are driving top line growth at a very profitable margin. We're going to continue as we did in Q1, for example, all revenue over achievement will result in greater earnings and that continues to be our focus.\nHeather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThanks very much. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could just-I want to go back to Magento again. Could you just walk us through I guess how you're thinking about the integration? I assume given the timing of your fiscal year op rate generally on a stand-alone basis. Is this a product that the Adobe salesforce can start taking to market once the deal closes? How are you thinking about integrating? Mainly from a go-to-market perspective once the deal closes over the next couple of quarters? Thank.\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Kirk, I think the salesforce is already chomping at the bit in terms of saying how do we, once the deal is closed, have Magento in our bag? It's such a natural extension. I think to your point, our focus has always been with acquisitions do no harm. Really make sure that we continue to bring to bear the Adobe brand, bring to bear the customer relationships that we have and truly understand the magic sauce that makes them so special. So certainly, in terms of from day one when we are closing being able to expand our story of how we can serve customers, looking at some of the customers. I think we pointed that out in the introductory call in terms of who they already have as customers. I think we will start to deliver to enterprises, but we will be a little cautious because we just want to make sure we have discipline on ramp to that particular product.\nKirk Materne -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThanks very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nDerrick Wood -- Cowen & Company -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks. I wanted to drill in on GDPR. One could argue it could have some mixed impact for you guys. The registration focuses on data minimization in terms of the amount of content companies should be storing about their end consumers and email lists have to be more scrutinized. I guess that could weigh on capacity subscription sales. But at the same time, companies are needing to put more governance and work flow around their digital engagements and you could see more standardization and more usage on the Adobe platform. You clearly had a good quarter, but how do you see these dynamics around GDPR working out and impacting the demand trajectory on Experience Cloud?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWhen I take a step back, Derrick, the trend toward online businesses and digital spend and the desire on the part of enterprises to understand attribution is only going to increase. More money is going to be spent digitally, but the bar of how that's being spent and the understanding and effectiveness of that marketing and spend is only going to increase. I think, big picture, we look at that as a big opportunity for advertising Cloud because not only are we a channel for the major online marketing platforms like search, social, display, and TV, but we're unique in that we have the broadest perspective of efficacy across all marketing spends.\nOn the second side, all companies will need to balance the customer acquisition where this third-party data plays an important role. The more important issue for all companies is going to be customer engagement, to your question around email lists and how you engage with them. There I think leveraging the first-party data is going to become even more crucial. We look at it and say we have the best of both worlds.\nThe Advertising Cloud will continue to focus on helping customer acquisition, but really the energy is going to be spent by companies more on Marketing Cloud, where engagement is going to be even more particular in this world of GDPR so that you don't in any way impact the trust that you've built with companies. I actually think Analytics also, across both acquisition and engagement will become even more critical in this new environment. So, you're right in that we have to help our companies navigate it. You're right and I think long term it just continues to be a tail wind as the leader in this business.\nDerrick Wood -- Cowen & Company -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for the color.\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, and very nice quarter. I just had a clarification question around the guidance. Last quarter, Mark Garrett was talking about Digital Media ARR and talking about Q3 and Q4. He expected the seasonality of Q3 and Q4 to follow similar to what was achieved in FY17. When I look at the ARR from last year, Q2 to Q3 was sort of flat seasonality. It looks like we're looking for closer to like down 9% to 10% this year. Did something change between Mark Garrett's comments and how we're thinking about ARR into Q3 this quarter?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, Keith. I think as I mentioned a little bit earlier, when you look from an absolute perspective, the Q3 target that we've provided for ARR will still be the largest that we have. I think we continue to see strength in the business, so nothing's changed from that particular quarter. I mentioned briefly that we just want to make sure that we get a little more experienced with what's happening with GDPR to Derrick and other people's questions associated with what's happening online, but it no way reflects a change in how we see the business. In Q4, again, we expect traditional strength in the business.\nKeith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. So some caution perhaps around GDPR potentially pushing some Digital Media business from Q3 into Q4?\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I think we look at it from a first half/second half. We still continue to model it. You can look at it as we just want to make sure that we understand GDPR in more detail across Q3. Yes.\nKeith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you very much.\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi, thank you very much. Shantanu, I'm just curious, if you look like companies in your peer group -- Microsoft, Intuit -- they've had revenue growth in some of the key businesses outpace unit growth. Obviously, pricing and RPU growth has been a key trend in the industry. I'm curious how you think about that. Are you at a point where it's more so RPU growth versus unit growth? If so, what is driving that? If you, on the contrary, believe what you said on the previous earnings conference call that the TAM is a multiple of the previous cycle, I'm curious to hear you elaborate on why you believe the TAM is a multiple of the prior cycle. That's it for me. Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I think when we look at the two businesses where we have a B2C business, when we look at Acrobat and units growth for Acrobat, in all the strength in the Document Cloud business is being driven by unit growth, rather than what you would call RPU growth. When we look at customer acquisition in Creative Cloud, we've been pretty forthcoming about how it's really being driven by new people coming to our platform. I can't comment on what Microsoft and Intuit are saying, but from our point of view, it's certainly being driven a lot more by new customer acquisitions and focused on that.\nAs we think about big picture of what we are focused on in Creative, the first is let's just continue to drive net new subscriptions, focus on retention. The pool is becoming larger and larger. Emerging markets, I would say a little bit more of adjacent markets, what we've done with education and hobbyist. We continue to make sure that RPUs are increasing, as people go into renewals. Price is not on that first list of things that we are focused on, given where we are in the cycle.\nKash Rangan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nBrilliant. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nPat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you. Shantanu, I'm going to step back a little bit. I'm curious, on the artificial intelligence side of things, how far away are we from having Sensei help customers search video content with a high degree of accuracy? So, you know, \"Sensei, find all the footage that has Brad Pitt in it?\"\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Pat, I think if you look at what we already have with respect to Adobe Stock, the two things that I would call Adobe Magic that Sensei has provided first is auto tagging. So, you can actually get thousands of pictures and we have the ability based on the prior data set to be able to tag it and infer intent and so you can search. The canonical example we give is fire engine truck versus it being called different things in different countries. We already have that. With video as well, I think we have the ability across frames to do searching. It's only going to get better and better with the data sets. But that data is not far in terms of being able to find across video. In fact, we have already demonstrated abilities to do search on video.\nPat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you.\nMike Saviage -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nOperator, we're coming up on the hour. Why don't we take one more question, please?\nOperator\nYour last question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal. Your line is open.\nBrian Wieser -- Pivotal Research Group -- Analyst\nThanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could offer a little more color on what you're seeing with the Advertising Cloud. You called it out certainly as supporting some of the growth there. We see some of the peers to that business, Trade Desk in particular, doing phenomenally well. Related to GDPR, as we're seeing something of a shakeout with much of the ad tech sector, I'm wondering if you see opportunities for deeper investment, as it seems like anyone with deep pockets and a long time horizon is maybe well positioned to take advantage just growing organically or by picking up businesses that are now average.\nShantanu Narayen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe had a strong revenue quarter for Advertising Cloud in Q2. I think if you looked at our overall revenue growth of 18%, it was certainly higher than what we had guided to. Advertising Cloud played a role in that. I think to your point we are one of the few companies that has the breadth to have the ability for people to invest across [inaudible] display and all forms of TV.\nI think we're pretty uniquely positioned. I think what's even more unique about our offering is the tie-in to the segmentation that we have with audience manager and the analytics that we provide on the efficacy of the spend. So, we continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have, both in Advertising Cloud as a separate cloud and opportunity, and the integration of that across the entire Experience Cloud.\nSince, Brian, that was the last question, in close, the momentum in our business clearly continued in Q2. We continue to be excited about the product roadmap that we will deliver in the second half and the innovation agenda. Big picture, the strategy of empowering people to create, as well as helping businesses transform continue to be large, addressable markets with good tailwinds. We'll continue to focus on driving both top line and bottom line growth with significant margins while we invest in technology as a long-term differentiator for Adobe.
