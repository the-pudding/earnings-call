Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nThank you, Mariann and thank you all for joining our call today. Today Puma reported total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 of $71.1 million. Total revenue consisted of product revenue for sales of NERLYNX and license revenue. We are pleased to report that sales of NERLYNX, also known as neratinib, Puma's first approved drug have continued to grow since launch.\nNERLYNX was approved by the US, FDA in July 2017 for the treatment of patients with early stage HER2 positive breast cancer who have previously been treated with a trastuzumab containing regimen. Today, we reported net NERLYNX sales of $61.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase from the $52.6 million in net sales reported in the third quarter of 2018.\nIn addition, our fourth quarter results included license revenue of $10 million, which represents a milestone payment we received from one of our licensing partners. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Steve Lo, Puma's, Chief Commercial Officer, who will provide an update on NERLYNXlaunch related activities and detail our commercial progress in the US to date.\nAs we announced in September 2018, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for NERLYNX for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage hormone receptor positive, HER2 positive breast cancer and who are less than one year from the completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab based therapy.\nWe expect NERLYNX to be commercially available in the European Union this year, beginning with our launch in Germany and followed by additional countries -- additional European countries throughout 2019. In collaboration with our licensing partners, we also anticipate announcing a regulatory decisions on neratinib for the extended adjuvant, HER2 positive early stage breast cancer indication in countries outside the United States and Europe during the first half of 2019.\nWe also look forward to several additional clinical milestones for neratinib. As investors are aware, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced top line data from our Phase III trial of neratinib in third-line HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, also known as the NALA Trial. The trial has a co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival and overall survival.\nFor the progression-free -- I'm sorry, for the primary analysis of essentially confirmed progression-free survival, treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine, resulted in a statistically significant improvement in essentially confirmed PFS with a p-value of 0.0059 compared to treatment with lapatinib plus capecitabine.\nFor the primary analysis of overall survival, neratinib plus capecitabine resulted in an improvement that did not achieve statistical significance, but trended positively in favor of the neratinib plus capecitabine arm of the study with a p-value of 0.21. For the secondary endpoint of time to intervention for symptomatic central nervous system diseases, also referred to as brain metastasis, the results from the trial showed that treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine led to an improvement over the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine with a p-value of 0.043.\nThe safety profile of neratinib in the Phase III NALA study was consistent with previous clinical trials of Neratinib. Puma plans to meet with the United States, Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency during the first half of 2019 to discuss the results from this trial. We further anticipate that the results of the trial will be presented at a major medical conference in the first half of 2019. Puma also has an ongoing basket trial of neratinib in HER2 mutated cancers referred to as the SUMMIT trial.\nIn 2017, data was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting or AACR, demonstrating that HER2 mutations were found in approximately 2% to 12% of almost every solid tumor.\nThe initial data from the SUMMIT trial was presented at the AACR meeting in 2017 and was published in Nature in 2018. We anticipate that updated data on the cohort of patients from the SUMMIT trial with HER2 mutated cervical cancer who were treated with neratinib will be presented in the plenary session at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology or SGO Annual Meeting in March.\nIn addition, Puma plans to meet with the FDA in the first half of 2019 to discuss the clinical development and regulatory strategy for neratinib in patients with HER2 mutations, with the goal of discussing a potential tumor agnostic indication for neratinib in HER2 mutated tumors.\nWe will continue to update investors, as we obtain more information with regard to this matter. In addition, we expect to report additional data from our Phase II Control study involving the use of antidiarrheal regimens on neratinib associated diarrhea, in patients with HER2 positive early stage breast cancer in the first half of 2019.\nThis will include updated data on the cohorts of patients receiving loperamide alone or in combination with budesonide or colestipol and will also include data from the most recent cohort in the trial that uses no antidiarrheal drugs as prophylaxis, but instead uses a dose escalation strategy during the first month of treatment in an effort to reduce the side effects and improve the tolerability of the drug.\nI will now turn the call over to Steve Lo, who will discuss our US commercialization strategy and progress to-date for NERLYNX. Steve will then be followed by Maximo Nougues, who will highlight key components of our financial statements for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.\nSteven Lo -- Chief Commercial Officer\nThank you, Alan. NERLYNX has been in the US market since our FDA approval in July of 2017. Since then, thousands of patients have been prescribed NERLYNX. We continue to grow sales in the fourth quarter and look forward to continuing to provide NERLYNX to more patients. A reminder that during my presentation I will be making forward-looking statements.\nOn Slide 3, as you may recall, our network of six specialty pharmacies provide NERLYNX directly to patients. The specialty pharmacies conduct benefit investigations obtain a prior authorization approval from the insurance Company and then arrange with the patient to ship NERLYNX to their home.\nWe have also have a separate specialty distribution in-office dispensing channel, where the prescription does not need to be sent to the specialty pharmacy. This helps to facilitate the ability for certain patients to obtain NERLYNX directly from their physician's office, integrate its healthcare systems, and also the VA.\nTo allow better access for patients, we expanded the distribution channel throughout 2018 and established partnerships with physician networks. As a result, we have continued to see an increase in patients being dispensed NERLYNX through hospitals and physician practices in the specialty distribution network.\nIn the fourth quarter, sales in this channel, continued to grow and represented as much as approximately 19% of total bottles sold in certain weeks. Later in the call, Maximo will review the full financial results, but I will now provide you with the current sales results.\nOn Slide 4, you see quarterly net sales of NERLYNX since FDA approval. As Alan mentioned, our net product sales revenue grew to $61.1 million in the fourth quarter, a 16% increase over the prior quarter. We are also pleased to report full year 2018 net sales for NERLYNX of $200.5 million, our first full calendar year since launch.\nThe growth in the fourth quarter was the result of an increase in patient refills in the specialty pharmacies and also an increase in demand in both the specialty pharmacy and distribution channels. In particular, our partnerships with physician networks such as ION and US Oncology have given our sales force, better access and allow patients to obtain their NERLYNX prescription in the physician's office, resulting in the growth seen in the specialty distribution channel.\nWe were also encouraged to see some sales regions that previously have lower sales volumes growing during the fourth quarter as a result of new personnel hired into those regions.\nSlide 5, shows the growth by quarter of NERLYNX bottles sold. This represents all channels; specialty pharmacy and specialty distributor. There was a 12% increase of total bottles sold from Q3 to Q4 as well our steady growth throughout the year. You may notice the revenue growth is higher than the bottle growth. This is due to a more favorable gross to net in the fourth quarter.\nOn Slide 6, I would like to highlight an important program we launched in the third quarter of 2018 for patients. This is our supportive care voucher program, which provides up to three-months of antidiarrheal products for free to eligible patients.\nAs many of you know, the primary reason why a patient discontinues NERLYNX early is due to side effects. But discontinuations occur more frequently in the first month. While most physicians prescribe an antidiarrheal medication with NERLYNX, our research show that some patients may not fill the antidiarrheal prescription. There were also some physicians, not prescribing any of these medications at all, which we believe was due to the lack of awareness of the data from our control trial using prophylactic antidiarrheal drugs.\nThis supportive care voucher helps eliminate the financial barrier for patients to obtain loperamide, budesonide, colestipol or other antidiarrheal medications.\nSince launching this program, the number of vouchers used has increased strongly from Q3 to Q4 and may have been an additional driver to sales growth in the quarter. We are encouraged to see more patients and physicians using these vouchers, which we are hopeful will help in keeping patients on drug longer and reducing the discontinuations.\nOn Slide 7, you see that most patients receive NERLYNX in 10 days or less and 74% of the patients receive it in 15 days or less, which we believe is a continued sign of a smooth reimbursement process and good payer coverage. This has been consistent throughout the time NERLYNX has been in the market. There is a small number of patients who have been prescribed NERLYNX for off-label use such as metastatic HER2 amplified or HER2 mutated cancer which we do not market or promote. This is when the insurance Company needs more information. These situations contribute to the longer times to fill shown on the right hand side of the slide.\nNow, on to prescribers on Slide 8. We continue to make progress in reaching our target physician audience increasing to 68% in the fourth quarter. This represents physicians who our sales force has met with, not physicians who have prescribed the drug. Also there are more physicians restricting access to sales reps and we have opportunities to reach them through medical conferences or online, which is not reflected in the numbers here. We believe there are still more opportunities to reach more physicians, especially increasing their awareness of diarrhea management options. We also believe that there are opportunities to get physicians who we have met with, but have not yet prescribed NERLYNX to begin prescribing NERLYNX.\nAs Alan mentioned, we are committed to making NERLYNX available to patients across the world, we have formed great partnerships throughout the world with companies who have commercial and regulatory expertise in that region. As you can see on Slide 9. We expect both regulatory approvals and launches outside the United States in 2019. In addition, on a parallel path we are exploring partnership opportunities in Europe, while also preparing to launch ourselves. We continue to make progress on ensuring NERLYNX will be reimbursed by the health authorities in Europe.\nWe recently completed our submission to NICE in the United Kingdom. Germany, France and United Kingdom are the first countries in Europe, we are planning for product availability. As you may recall, we already have a managed access program in place for patients outside the United States.\nTo summarize, we are highly encouraged with the progress we've made with physicians, payers and patients and our full year net sales results for 2018. We continue to reach more prescribers and help patients receive and stay on their medication. We are committed to ensuring all appropriate patients have access to NERLYNX.\nI will now turn the call over to Maximo Nougues for a review of our financial results.\nMaximo F. Nougues -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Steve. Let me start with a quick summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018. Please note that we will be making comparisons to Q3 and Q2 2018, which we believe are better indications of our progress as a flat commercial Company than all year-over-year comparisons.\nFor more information, I recommend that you refer to our 10-K, which will be filed with the SEC tomorrow and includes our consolidated financial statements.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, we reported a net loss based on GAAP of $30.7 million or $0.80 per share. Our GAAP net losses for Q3 and Q2 2018 were $14.2 million and $44.3 million respectively. As you may recall, our results for the third quarter of 2018 included a reimbursement from our insurance carriers of approximately $10 million for legal expenses in connection with various lawsuits.\nIn Q4, we recorded approximately $9 million of expense for estimated damages that may be paid pursuant to a jury verdict in a class action lawsuit.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which is adjusted to remove the impact of stock-based compensation we reported a net loss of $12.2 million or $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018. As well as Steve mentioned, net revenue from NERLYNX sales were $61.1 million versus $52.6 million for the third quarter of 2018.\nDuring December, one of the specialty pharmacies purchase approximate -- approximately $0.5 million to $1 million of additional NERLYNX, which we believe represented an inventory stocking ahead of an anticipated price increase in January.\nNERLYNX net sales were $200.5 million for the full year 2018, compared to $26.2 million in NERLYNX sales for 2017. We are pleased that 2018 sales of $200.5 million slightly beat our 2018 revenue guidance of $175 million to $200 million. Our gross to net reduction was approximately 7% for the fiscal year of 2018. Cost of sales for the fourth quarter was $10.3 million, which included amortization of milestone payments to the licensor of neratinib of approximately $1 million.\nGoing forward, we will continue to recognize amortization of the milestone payments to the licensor for about $1 million per quarter as cost of goods sold.\nFor fiscal year 2019, Puma anticipates the NERLYNX net US sales will be in the range of $255 million to $280 million. We also assume that the gross to net will be approximately 9% in 2019. We further anticipate that Puma will receive licensing and royalty revenues from its licensing partners in the range of $5 million to $10 million in 2019.\nWe anticipate providing guidance on the expected range of 2019 NERLYNX sales in Europe on our second quarter earnings call. SG&A expenses were $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $28.5 million and $41 million for Q3 and Q2 2018 respectively.\nSG&A expenses were included non-cash charges for stock-based compensation of $7.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $9.4 million and $8.5 million for Q3 and Q2 2018.\nResearch and development expenses were $38.4 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $36.4 million and $43.3 million for Q3 and Q2 2018. R&D expenses included non-cash charges for stock-based compensation $10.6 million compared to $11.4 million and $13.6 million for Q3 and Q2 2018.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, Puma reported positive cash flow of approximately $8 million, compared to cash burn for approximately $7 million for Q3 and cash burn of $15 million for Q2 2018. We are pleased to have achieved our previously stated goal of positive cash flow in the fourth quarter. We ended the fourth quarter of 2018 with about $108 million in cash and cash equivalents and $57 million in marketable securities.\nOur accounts receivables balance at the end of December 31st was $20.8 million. Our accounts receivable terms range between 10 and 68 days, while our days sales outstanding are about 38 days. Our distribution network maintains approximately three weeks of inventory. Overall, we continue to deploy our financial resources to focus on the investment of neratinib to ongoing clinical trials and the commercialization of NERLYNX.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board \nThanks, Maximo and Steve. Since, we launched NERLYNX for the treatment of early stage HER2 positive breast cancer, in the third quarter of 2017, we have continued to receive positive feedback from patients, prescribers and payers.\nWe will continue to move forward with our plans to advance and expand our commercial activities for the balance of 2019 and beyond. This concludes today's presentation. We will now turn the floor back to the operator for Q&A.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Alethia Young of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\nAlethia Young -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst\nThank you and congrats on a solid quarter and guide. One, I wanted to talk a little bit more about the discontinuations, and I know you've been doing a lot of work there to try to help with that process. Would you be willing to kind of characterize what the rate was this quarter? And then maybe just talk a little more about what we think has really worked to kind of drive maybe kind of more compliance when you are doing some of the CONTROL based regimens.\nAnd my second question, is just basically around Europe and you were talking about partnership or go alone. I mean, is there a situation that you would prefer or, what’s kind of the task that goes on making that decision around what you’re going to do in Europe?\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nOkay, on the first quarter of discontinuations, Steve, would you like to take up, please.\nSteven Lo -- Chief Commercial Officer\nSure thing. Yeah, so, as I mentioned earlier, we've had a mix in the channel and so we typically only have visibility on patients in the specialty pharmacy channel. And what's also interesting is these patients may go back and forth. So it's a little more difficult today to track the discontinuations. But qualitatively, what I can say is that we have seen the trend go down for a few reasons. One is, as I mentioned the supportive care voucher program has been extremely helpful.\nWe've been educating physicians a lot more about the control regimens. And then thirdly, we also have a nurse team in place, which they are out in the field, educating the practices and we also have a nurse support line available as well. So, all those in general, I think have helped qualitatively.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nAnd Alethia, to add to that. Our understanding is that with any new drug that comes out, the more experience physicians get in using the drug, the better they get at managing side effects. For example, when Xeloda capecitabine was first launched, people had issues with the diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome. And with AFINITOR, when it was launched, we know people had issues with the stomatitis. As they use it more they get better at managing it.\nSo our assumption is that, that's probably benefiting us as well. To your second question -- to your second question regarding Europe. As Steve mentioned, we are looking at both the opportunities to launch the drug ourselves and to establish some type of a partnership or some type of a strategic type of a situation.\nI think we are committed to doing what's best for the shareholders, and that includes the senior managements of the Company and the Board of the Company, we are always committed to doing whatever is in the best interest of the shareholders.\nAlethia Young -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Thanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Paul Choi of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKelly Richardson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nHi, this is Kelly Richardson (ph) for Paul Choi. Just have one quick question, on how much of the plans and cash flow profitability are tied to metastatic utilization in 2019? Thank you.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board \nYeah, so in terms of the metastatic, our assumption is that we would file the NDA in the first half. I think, we said mid-2019, I believe, so June-ish time frame. I would anticipate that either it's a priority review or it's a standard review. Either of those would not be completed until 2020. So our guidance and our cash flow assumptions for 2019 do not include any utilization in the third line setting based on the NALA data.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Yigal Nochomovitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nYigal Nochomovitz -- Citigroup Inc. -- Analyst\nGreat. Hi, thank you and congrats on getting to cash flow positive for the fourth quarter and hopefully beyond. I have few questions. Alan, are you able to say at this point when you might be EPS profitable if that's something we could expect this year? And then on the guidance, I hope, I heard the numbers right. I think it was $255 million to $280 million, could you just expand on that a little bit, because obviously you guys took a 10% price increase recently in January and so that would imply that seems that the guidance is maybe a touch conservative, I just want to get a better understanding of what's going into that range? Thanks.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nYes, so regarding your first question on when Puma would be EPS profitable. I don't know that we would be EPS profitable in 2019. Obviously we have the opportunity to be fully cash flow positive in '19 with certain assumptions around that. But I think we'll be able to give a little bit better guidance on that, on the second quarter call.\nIn terms of your question on the guidance. When we issued our guidance in 2018, of $175 million to $200 million, the first question we got on that was someone saying, well, your guidance looks conservative. And my answer to that was, well, we're much happier to take a conservative guidance and we're more than happy to adjust that whichever way we need to later in the year.\nSo you're asking the same question again, I think it's fair to assume that we are always more comfortable being conservative and that certainly gives us an opportunity to later address that later in the year.\nYigal Nochomovitz -- Citigroup Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay, perfect. And then just to follow up, could you comment at all, as far as how much of the December holiday seasons may have in some respect been a headwind to the $61 million that you reported in the fourth quarter?\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nI don't know that we have any evidence that the December holidays had any impact headwind or a tailwind. I don't think we have any evidence that it was either.\nYigal Nochomovitz -- Citigroup Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay. And then, just a few other market dynamics question, have you seen any shift towards colestipol and away from loperamide? And can you comment on what would the percent of patients that might be going beyond 12-months? Thank you.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nOkay. So first of all, do you want to (inaudible)…\nSteven Lo -- Chief Commercial Officer\nYes. So I'll address the first question on a shift to colestipol. So we don't receive any prescription data on the, in anti-diarrheal. So this will always be anecdotally what we get from the market research from physicians or what is reported back to us from the physician's office. I would look at it this way. We've been fairly agnostic. The most important piece is we want patients to receive an antidiarrheal when they receive a NERLYNX prescription. And that's been the main message. More physicians are becoming more aware of the control data and they see the data for themselves.\nBut we have seen colestipol, budesonide and loperamide used across the board.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nAnd then I would add to that, we applied to FDA to have our label updated. So, you'll remember that at the time we got approved, we were only allowed to put in the data on, from the control study and just the loperamide alone arm, because at that time -- that was the only arm we had a full 12-months of data on.\nUnfortunately that arm has a very high rate of discontinuations. I believe, if I remember the data correctly, the CONTROL study showed that in the loperamide alone arm, the discontinuation rate was somewhere around ballpark 40%. We have, we submitted somewhere around November, December of last year to have the budesonide arm put into the label. And so I would anticipate that, sometime probably Q2 or so, we would be getting the label updated to include the budesonide arm, we will then follow with the colestipol arms. I think the last data we had on the budesonide arm that we be published, I thought the discontinuation rate was, don’t quote me on this, but if I remember this correctly, was somewhere in like the 20% to 25% range or something like that. And obviously, shifting to that will help improve the discontinuations as well. So I think that, as we get that data into the label, right now we can’t promote it, but as we get that data into the label, we'll be able to promote that. So I'd imagine we would start seeing more use of those regimens going forward.\nSteven Lo -- Chief Commercial Officer\nYeah, this is Steve. On your second question regarding patients who go beyond 12 lives. As I mentioned earlier, now that we have a larger specialty distribution channel in office dispensing, it's becoming a little more difficult to track that since some patients move back and forth. I know in the past, we reported that there are patients who go beyond the 12-months and that's still happening, but we just don't have the exact numbers behind that.\nYigal Nochomovitz -- Citigroup Inc. -- Analyst\nAll right. And just one quick one, I just want to make sure I heard correctly. You gave guidance for the licensing partner revenue $5 million to $20 million, did I hear that correct -- $15 million to $20 million, what was that number?\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nIt’s $5 million to $10 million.\nYigal Nochomovitz -- Citigroup Inc. -- Analyst\n$5 million to $10 million for 2019. Okay. Thank you.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nAnd Yigal, just so, you know, there's some other payments that we didn't put in there, because it's uncertain on the timing of them. So that number may be conservative. It's just there is certain payments that there are milestones that need to be hit. And it's not clear if those are going to come in 2019 or in 2020. So we did not include those milestones in that guidance.\nYigal Nochomovitz -- Citigroup Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nCory Kasimov -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Most were asked, but one I have is, are you able to give us the net active patients by month, similar to what you've done in the last couple of quarters as opposed to just the bottles sold?\nSteven Lo -- Chief Commercial Officer\nHi, Corey. Yeah, this is Steve. Yeah, unfortunately it's -- as I've been mentioning, it's a little more difficult now, since we have expanded the specialty distribution channel. And so because of that, we don't receive metrics from the in-office dispensing regarding actual patients, whether there was a new prescription or even a refill. So, because of that high amount of variability and we can’t track patients longitudinally, it is very difficult to provide net active patients moving forward.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nYes, Corey, just -- to just to clarify Corey. Yeah, so in past quarters, as you know, we have the two channels. Right, there is the specialty pharmacies, where a prescription is written and then they physically deliver it to the patient. And then there's the specialty distribution which we tend to call the in-office dispensing because the bottle is just given to the patient right in the physician's office.\nIn past quarters that in office dispensing was only about 5%. So our ability to say, all right, here is the estimate for the number of active patients the error bars around that what kind of low.\nAs you heard, we are now seeing a lot -- almost 19%, going into that in office dispensing. It creates much larger error bars around those numbers and it makes it more challenging for us to try to estimate the actual number of active patients. So the bottled numbers is probably the best way to do that because we assume every bottle is a patient, right.\nI can't understand why someone will get two bottles at once. That's probably the best way to do it.\nCory Kasimov -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay, all right. And then, I guess just two clarifications, can you repeat what the gross to net was in 4Q and how that compared to 3Q?\nMaximo F. Nougues -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, the four to net – sorry, the gross to net in Q4 was 4% -- in, or close to 4%, sorry. In Q3, it was close to 7%. The explanation for that is we have been using an estimate based on a claims history that wasn't our own on a similar product. Now that we have 12-months of claims, we can actually go back and see what actually has happened for the last 12-months and we basically reconcile that in Q4.\nCory Kasimov -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay. And then my last question is, how much did inventory change in the fourth quarter, ahead of the January price increase. I heard what you said about the one specialty pharmacy was like up to $1 million. But can you say overall, how much inventory changed?\nMaximo F. Nougues -- Chief Financial Officer\nOur estimate has remained fairly flat. Around the three weeks, I think, I mentioned that is really, hasn't changed that much.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nAnd Cory, to think -- regarding the inventory builds from that one pharmacy, which was, I think we said in the range of $500,000, to $1 million. An easy way to look at that is, if you say that the quarter's numbers was about $60 million, there's 12-weeks in the quarter, so that's $5 million a week. There is basically five business days, so it’s $1 million a day. So that basically comes down to somewhere around one day.\nCory Kasimov -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay, all right. Great. Thanks, Alan.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Shibutani of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nPam -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nHi. This is Pam on for Chris, add my congrats on the strong quarter. Do you have an estimate, of the average duration of treatment, specifically in 2018 and how that might change in 2019?\nSteven Lo -- Chief Commercial Officer\nHi, this is Steve. Yes, I will provide a very similar answer. Because of the fact that we are unable to track patients who start or are interim in the specialty distribution channel, it's very difficult to track patients longitudinally and therefore we don't have those duration numbers.\nPam -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nOkay, interesting. And perhaps maybe just a quick follow-up. Do you have plans to look into this or to determine if you're relatively close to the maximum duration you would expect, which would be about 12-months?\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nYes. So I think that, that is obviously something we're looking into. As you know, we have a number of programs in place, as Steve mentioned, which include the vouchers, increased awareness of our CONTROL trial data and then obviously the label updates. So our hope is that whatever the current median duration of treatment is, we have the opportunity to improve that in 2019.\nBut yes, we are planning on looking into that during -- during this year, especially as we get these new initiatives more rolling, so perhaps we can report on that at a later call.\nPam -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nKennen MacKay -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHey guys, congrats on the clinical and commercial execution on the quarter. First off, I had a quick follow-up on the inventory question given the sort of four time -- four fold increase in the in-office dispensing where there is some inventory. It seems like the statements around three weeks of inventory on hand, presumably for this channel, we're a little bit different. Can you maybe help us understand a little bit for the entire quarter what the impact of inventory was given in prior quarters? It seems like it was very close to nothing, presumably because it was almost all through the (inaudible) channel?\nMaximo F. Nougues -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo, we actually haven't seen that change between channels in terms of the three weeks average. I looked at the last three quarters on what we have reported and again it stays about the same. Obviously, our sales have increased, so the number of bottles in inventory out there, it has increased but that average is still about three-weeks.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nAnd Kennen, you rambled something thereabout. It was once zero and now it's three-weeks. The inventory was never zero. And as always, I think since we've been tracking this launch, it's always been right around three weeks. We've never, it would be impossible to have zero inventory.\nKennen MacKay -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you. And apologies to that, Alan. And maybe just more broadly, was wondering given the very impressive growth we saw from Q3 to Q4, sort of, if you could elaborate a little bit on commercially any of the differences that we've seen this quarter versus, for instance, prior quarter. Is it much more in-office dispensing and the impact of additional use of prophylactic Imodium or other antidiarrheals in new patient starts? Thank you.\nSteven Lo -- Chief Commercial Officer\nYes, this is Steve. Yeah, so there were a few drivers this quarter that we've certainly noticed. Number one, we had very strong -- of the patients that we track who were able to refill, we tracked an increase in refills in the specialty pharmacy channel, so that was one driver. The second driver, as you mentioned, included the growth in the in-office dispensing and the specialty pharmacies didn't suffer from that because they also grew as well. So I believe that that was certainly some very good demand driven there. And then I also highlighted the fact that our high-performing regions have continued to perform, but we're now seeing some of the lower volume regions start to grow as well. And I believe that I think with new personnel in place, as well as physicians being more educated with better access, they are understanding not only the efficacy, but also the ability to manage side effects.\nKennen MacKay -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThat's it. Thanks, Steve. Congrats again. Really impressive commercial quarter.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Schmidt of Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Schmidt -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a few, maybe first, Alan around the potential launch in Europe this year, how should we think about operating expenses going forward, maybe thinking of the fourth quarter '18 run rate in terms of how much additional infrastructure buildout might be necessary in Europe?\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nSo, Michael, building a sales force in Europe is very different than building one in the United States, because obviously when you build one in the US, you have to go all 50 states at once, whereas in Europe, you kind of go country by country, right. And you can't launch in a specific country until you get reimbursement. The only one you can launch in is Germany, right, which is obviously not as big as United States. Obviously, it’s much smaller. So you tend to have rather than having a huge number of expenses upfront, like you would on a US launch, it tends to be more protracted over time.\nSo I think that on our second quarter call, when we started giving guidance for European sales and gave a little more clarification on our path forward, I think we will be in a better position to do that. But again, I wouldn't anticipate that the cost of a build-out in Europe in 2019 would be something that would be similar to what we did in the US. It's just a much smaller and longer-term type of a build.\nMichael Schmidt -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nThanks. It did make sense. And then how should we think about pricing assumptions in Europe and potentially rest of world as well?\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nYes. I don't know that we're in a position to give that yet. I would rather wait until we’re little more mature in our decisions on Europe and then we can give it at that time.\nMichael Schmidt -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nAnd then maybe one more question on sales dynamics in the fourth quarter. And I understand that a lot of that has been driven by refills and maybe a decrease in discontinuation better compliance rates. But can you help us understand maybe a little bit more how your patient new starts are trending relative to early in the year?\nSteven Lo -- Chief Commercial Officer\nYes, this is Steve. We did see an increase in new patient starts right in January. So that's at least encouraging and that's really essentially what we've been tracking.\nMichael Schmidt -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Thomas Smith of SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas J. Smith -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nHey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the number of prescribers you reached. I think you mentioned that you've now detailed about 68% of your target. Can you give us a sense of how many of the physicians you detailed are I guess what you would call active prescribers of NERLYNX? Or maybe give us a sense of how many of those prescribers have yet to write a prescription for NERLYNX?\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nYes. So with regard to -- so again, the physicians who we've detailed means that our sales reps have met with them. It doesn't mean they are prescribers. The numbers in that graph are just the ones our sales reps have met with not the ones that actually have prescribed the drug. I would say that a rough estimate is that I think we're looking at over 60% of them have become prescribers. So obviously, there's still a lot more to move there, there's lot more in the needle to move there in terms of new prescribers.\nSo there's obviously still a very nice opportunity for new prescriber growth.\nThomas J. Smith -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nRight. Okay, that's helpful. And then also could you give us a sense, I guess within these physician practices that it sounds like you're gaining better access to -- what's your sense for how much drug these physician practices are keeping on hand in their office to dispense?\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nYes, I think, we already commented that the inventory levels at -- to the in-office dispensing is the same inventory levels as in the specialty pharmacies. So those two inventory levels appear to be the same.\nSteven Lo -- Chief Commercial Officer\nYes. And this is Steve. I also add that because the wholesale acquisition price of this product is over $12,000 per bottle, the way that the offices have their agreements with the specialty distributor, typically they can order and receive product within 48 hours. So there really isn't a huge incentive for them to be storing a lot of product in the practice.\nThomas J. Smith -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nOkay, great. That's helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Yigal Nochomovitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nYigal Nochomovitz -- Citigroup Inc. -- Analyst\nThanks. I just had one follow-up related to the interplay of the adjuvant market and the metastatic market. And I know you only got the NALA data I think December 17th, so probably didn't impact the fourth quarter. But I'm just curious, what have you heard in the channel checks as you speak with the physicians about the interest in neratinib, in adjuvant given now that for second Phase III trial which has shown meaningful disease control? Is that creating a tailwind for the adjuvant market or is that not really a topic of discussion as you see it?\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nI don't know that we've seen any impact yet of that. Now, again, you're right. We just announced it in December. It's only been a month and a half or so -- I don't know that we've heard any feedback regarding that yet.\nYigal Nochomovitz -- Citigroup Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks, Alan.\nAlan H. Auerbach -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board\nSure.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session.
