This is mainly -- revenue from marketing services was $41.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of 16.3% from $49.6 million in the corresponding period of 2017.

Now, operator we will be open for Q&A session.\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We have a question from the line of Miranda Zhuang. Please ask your question.\nMiranda Zhuang -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThank you. Good evening, management. Thank you for taking my questions. It seems that the transaction of the property has recovered a bit in late March and early April. Can management share with us your view for the property market this year? And what's the sentiment of the advertising purchase on the property developers?\nAnd my second question is about the listing business. It seems that the competition for the listing business has become more intensified. Can management share with us your strategy this year for this business, especially on the traffic side and also empowering the real estate agents? Thank you.\nJian Liu -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. I will take the first question and hand over to Zijin. Can you take the second one? About the market, so Miranda as you mentioned, the market did recover shortly in quarter one, especially after Chinese New Year. The market has been good, Q2 (ph) not -- or about a week ago. So that's the situation. And most recently in the past one week, the top leadership, you know, reiterated again that the property market is -- should remain under-regulated, under heavy policy control.\nSo that's the situation. To my knowledge or my expectation with whole year will be -- the market will be -- keep the current status, which means, will be good, you know, to my understanding. Because we had a two year slowdown in the past. So, the accumulated demand in the two -- past two years, probably will be released this year 2019. So my judgement will be -- the market will be reasonably good for the rest of the year. But that said, I don't think that top management, the government will allow the -- another boom of property market again in 2019. So that's the situation to us. Our advertising has seen -- we have seen a growing momentum in our contract. We still need to have the cashing (ph) yet, but contract wise, we have seen, you know, double digit growth. (foreign language) Yeah. We have spent about 30% to 40% increase in the advertising contract. The listing side (foreign language) and the listing side which is called resale market which is also increasing or comparing to advertising, it's not as fast as the adverting in the market. So that is the situation of the market. So Zijin, can you answer the second question?\nZijin Li -- Acting Chief Financial Officer\nSecond question regarding to the listing. Currently for the fourth quarter in 2018, we can see the traffic of the website and the paying membership, number of peoples. And in the first quarter of 2019, there is definitely a increase. Due to the business strategy in the listing side, we are now pushing the agencies to be directly linked to our website. So the properties they listed on our website is more generous and it's like -- is reduced some human mis-statement in the listing -- listing introductions. So basically that's the main focus, we are doing right now to increase the quality of the listing.\nMiranda Zhuang -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nCan I have a follow up question? So for -- it looks like the research and data base services has been in a very good growth momentum since FY '18. So what's the strategy for this business in FY '19?\nJian Liu -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou're right. Our data analytics sector has been growing continuously. So this part, we call it China index holding, which is the part we're going to spin off as planned it. We had -- separately we had this further long we had over 30% growth last year and by quarter to quarter comparison, year-over-year. So we announced before that we're going to spin off that part of business. They're going to independently list with a stock exchange market. So that's the situation. We expected that the data and analytics business is going to continue their growth momentum in the whole year. Hopefully, we can have 30% growth top line, bottom line as well. However that said spending on our investment, spending our -- spending on promotion, marketing and the other R&D expenses. So that's the situation for the data and analytics business.\nMiranda Zhuang -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOkay. I see. Thank you very much.\nJian Liu -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nWe have the next question from the line of Frank Chen. Please ask your question.\nFrank Chen -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nThanks management for taking my question. This is Frank Chen from Macquarie. I have one quick question. As the market is recovering this year and our business is stabilizing and how should we think of our margin trend in 2019 and onwards? Can management share more color on the margin? Thanks very much.\nJian Liu -- Chief Executive Officer\nThe margin trend for the company, we are still to be more cost effective during the past years. And I think we still have loans to be more efficient in the way, we're doing our business.\nFrank Chen -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) As there are no questions, I'd like to hand the call back to your speakers for any closing remarks.
