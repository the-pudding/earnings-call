I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing financial highlights, followed by a discussion of the portfolio, investment activity, the financials and then open it up for Q&A.\nFor the quarter ended December 31st, we invested $180 million in primarily first lien senior secured assets and an average yield of 8.6%. PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund or PSSL continued to grow. As of December 31st, PSSL owned a $493 million diversified pool of 43 names with an average yield of 8.2%. Over the last several years we have substantially grown our platform by adding senior and mid-level investment professionals in regional offices as well as in New York. The additional people and offices combined with additional equity and debt capital we've raised has significantly enhanced our deal flow. This puts us in a position to be both active and selective. The growth is evidence of this enhanced platform.\nNet investment income was $0.28 per share. Core net investment income excluding accrued non-payable incentive fee and one-time credit facility amendment cost was $0.30 per share. Due to the activity level we are seeing and the growth of PSSL, we are pleased that our current run rate net investment income covers our dividend. Our earnings stream should have a nice tailwind based on a gradual increase in our debt to equity ratio, while still maintaining a prudent debt profile. As of September 30, our spillover was $0.31 per share.\nWith regard to the Small Business Credit Availability Act, a reminder that our Board approved the modified asset coverage that was included in the law, reducing asset coverage from 200% to 150% effective April 5, 2019. Over time, we are targeting a debt to equity ratio of 1.4x to 1.7x. We will now reach this target overnight. We will continue to carefully invest and it may take us several quarters to reach the new target.\nThe Company has generated an excellent track record over the last eight years, investing in lower-risk first lien senior secured floating-rate assets. We believe that such assets represent an appropriate risk profile that can be prudently leveraged to provide attractive returns for our investors. Our successful operation of PSSL, which is today operating at the same targeted debt to equity ratio is evidence of this strategy.\nDuring the quarter, we upsized our credit facility to $520 million from $405 million and completed the necessary amendments to enable us to reach the targeted debt-to-equity ratio. We are pleased that we received the support of all existing lenders and then we expanded our lender relationships. The support also highlights the confidence they have in our excellent track record. Our primary business of financing middle-market financial sponsors has remained robust. We have relationships with about 400 private equity sponsors across the country and elsewhere that we manage from our offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and London and we've done business with about 180 sponsors to date.\nDue to the wide funnel of deal flow that we receive relative to the size of our vehicles, we can be extremely selective about what we ultimately invest in. We remain primarily focused on long-term value and making investments that will perform well over several years and can withstand different business cycles. Our focus continues to be on companies and structures that are more defensive, have low leverage, strong covenants and high returns.\nWe are first call for middle-market financial sponsors, management teams and intermediaries, who want consistent and credible capital. As an independent provider free of conflicts or affiliations, we've become a trusted financing partner to our clients. As a result of our focus on high-quality companies, seniority in the capital structure, floating rate assets and continuing diversification, our portfolio is constructed to withstand market and economic volatility. The cash interest coverage ratio, the amount by which EBITDA or cash flow exceeds cash interest expense, continued to be a healthy 2.7x. This provides significant cushion to support stable investment income. Additionally, at cost, the ratio of debt-to-EBITDA on the overall portfolio was 4.6x, another indication of prudent risk.\nIn our core market of companies with $15 million to $50 million of EBITDA, our capital is generally important to borrowers and sponsors, we are still seeing attractive risk/reward, and we're receiving covenants, which help protect our capital. Our credit quality since inception nearly eight years ago has been excellent. Out of 343 companies in which we have invested since inception, we have experienced only five non-accruals. On those five non-accruals, we've recovered $0.98 on the dollar so far. As of December 31st, we had no non-accruals on our books.\nWith regard to economy and credit cycle, at this point, our underlying portfolio indicates a strong U.S. economy and no sign of a recession. From an experience standpoint, we are one of a few middle-market direct lenders who was in business prior to the global financial crisis and have a strong underwriting track record during that time. Although PFLT was not in existence back then, PennantPark as an organization was, and was focused primarily on investing in subordinated and mezzanine debt. Prior to the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008, we initiated investments which ultimately aggregated $480 million, again primarily in subordinated debt.\nDuring the recession, the weighted average EBITDA of those underlying portfolio companies declined by 7.2% at the trough of the recession. This compares to the average EBITDA decline of the Bloomberg North American High Yield Index of down 42%. As a result, the IRR on those underlying investments was 8%, even though they were done prior to the financial crisis and recession. We are proud of this downside case track record on primarily subordinated debt.\nIn terms of new investments, we had another active quarter investing in attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our activity was driven by a mixture of M&A deals, growth financings and refinancings. In virtually all these investments, we've known these particular companies for a while, have studied the industries or have a strong relationship with the sponsor.\nLet's walk through some of the highlights. We purchased $14.7 million in the first lien term loan and $300,000 of the common equity of American Insulated Glass. The Company is a fabricator and value-added distributor of glass products, AV Capital is the sponsor. ECommission Financial Servicesis an online finance platform that specializes in providing real estate agents with advanced payment of commissions.\nWe purchased $24.8 million of the first lien term loan and $200,000 of the common equity. Lightyear Capital is the sponsor. We purchased $11.2 million of the first lien term loan of Peninsula Pacific Entertainment. The company is a new -- is newly formed to develop, own and operate gaming opportunities in the newly regulated Virginia market. PGP Investors is the sponsor.\nTurning to the outlook, we believe that 2019 will be active due to both growth and M&A-driven financings. Due to our strong sourcing network and client relationships, we're seeing active deal flow. Let me now turn the call over to Aviv, our CFO, to take us through the financial results.\nAviv Efrat -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nThank you, Art. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, net investment income was $0.28 per share. Core net investment income was $0.30 per share, excluding our reversal of $0.04 per share of accrued, not payable incentive fee and excluding $0.06 per share of one-time financing costs, net of investment -- incentive fees.\nLooking at some of the expense categories. Management fees totaled about $3 million, excluding $1 million, accrued not payable incentive fees. General and administrative expenses totaled about $1.1 million, and interest expense totaled about $5 million, excluding the one-time $4.5 million dollars credit facility financing amendment costs.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31st, net unrealized depreciation on investment was about $12 million or $0.32 per share. Net realized gains was about $1 million or $0.02 per share. Net unrealized appreciation in our credit facility and notes was $6 million or $0.14 per share. Net investment income covered our dividends. Consequently, NAV went from $13.82 per share to $13.66 per share.\nOur entire portfolio, our credit facility and notes are marked-to-market by our Board of Directors each quarter using the exit price provided by an independent valuation firm exchanges or independent broker-dealer quotations when active markets are available under ASC 820 and 825. In cases where broker-dealer quotes are inactive, we use independent valuation firms to value the investments.\nOur portfolio is highly diversified with 85 companies across 25 different industries. 91% is invested in first lien senior secured debt, including 12% in PSSL, 2% in second-lien debt and 7% in equity, including 5% in PSSL. Our overall debt portfolio has a weighted average yield of 9.2%. 100% of the portfolio is floating rate.\nNow let me turn the call back to Art.\nArt Penn -- Founder and Managing Partner\nThanks, Aviv. To conclude, we want to reiterate our mission. Our goal is a steady, stable and protected dividend stream, coupled with the preservation of capital. Everything we do is aligned to that goal. We try to find less risky middle-market companies that have high free cash flow conversion. We capture that free cash flow, primarily in first lien senior secured floating rate debt instruments, and we pay out those contractual cash flows in the form of dividends to our shareholders.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our extremely talented team of professionals for their commitment and dedication. Thank you all for your time today and for your investment and confidence in us. That concludes our remarks. At this time, I would like to open up the call to questions.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions)\nArt Penn -- Founder and Managing Partner\nThis is Art Penn.
