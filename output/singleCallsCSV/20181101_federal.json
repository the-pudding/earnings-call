If you have additional questions, please feel free to get back in the queue.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As $1.58 a share in the third quarter, we generated more funds from operations in a 90-day period than we ever had in our 56 year history. On an absolute basis, this was simply the best quarter we've ever had. More than 5% ahead of last year's quarter and in excess of both the Street and our internal expectations, contributions came from all parts of our business and on both coasts.\nOverall rental income grew 5.5% quarter-over-quarter. Earnings growth at comparable properties was particularly strong at 3.5%. The comparable portfolio remains 95% leased and 94% occupied. And operating expenses including G&A but not including real estate taxes, actually fell slightly quarter-over-quarter, despite $12 million more in revenue. Real estate taxes, it seems, never goes down.\nThe only metric that was underwhelming for us on the surface was comparable retail lease rollover grow 6%. 90-day comparable -- 90 comparable deals for 448,000 square feet at an average rent of $38.31 per square foot, 6% above the $36.22 the previous tenant was paying the last year lease. It's not bad, but it's not what you're used to see. So, let's take a deeper look.\nIn breaking down the overall results, space leased to new tenants grew at 13% with the previous tenant, while renewal of existing tenants grew at only 2%. That's the combined 6% rollover. The detail supporting the 2% renewal rollover rates revealed that more than half of the renewal rent came from just two deals, both of whom renewed flat over the last year of the previous lease, and therefore depressed the reported percentage increase. A strong credit anchor at East Bay Bridge in Emeryville, California, and the Best Buy building at Santana Row.\nNow, many of you who are familiar with our portfolio know both of those properties well. So, let me spend a minute on the transactions behind the summarized metrics that hopefully help interpret what they mean. So, consider this. Rent in the East Bay Bridge anchor lease has been increasing annually at 3% since it's inception in 1995 through 2009, and 3. 5% annually since 2009. I don't know of any big anchor deals that have those kind of embedded annual bonds ever. Most were flat for five or 10 years, and then bumped 10% or so. Run a math, those are very different economics.\nSo we decided to renew it flat to the grown prior year's rent, and from here it will continue to grow 3.5% annually for the option period. By the way, no tenant improvement dollars from us. Given more typical anchor lease terms, this new rent would equate to a huge bump over the old rent. And our rollover statistics would have reflected double-digit growth, yet we will be far worse off economically. The strength in location, the lease terms, and a very strong productivity of the store allowed us to get paid millions more in rent along the way, deal terms matter.\nNext, rent paid by the anchor at the hard corner of Stevens Creek and Winchester Boulevard, Santana Row, more than paid for construction of the building they occupy, by the time the initial term of the lease expired in 2014. And with the exercise of their first option back then has paid for the building more than twice over. The exercise of their second five-year option came in this quarter at the same rent, despite significant supply coming on line at Valley Fair across the street. And again no TI dollars paid by us.\nThe real estate economics here are incredibly compelling, despite negatively impacting rollover metric. I go through those two leases in particular because digging behind any and all of the reported metrics is increasingly important as all of our businesses get more complicated and harder to compare. But at the end of the day, it comes down to FFO per share growth. We're particularly proud of the consistency and sustainability of that earnings growth year-in and year-out, no excuses. It's why we worked as hard as we have to diversify our revenue streams, and why we're using our existing real estate platforms to create and enhance real estate value through redevelopment and intensification on both coasts.\nThe focal point is exploitation of our superior locations and cash flow stream, through the lens of a broad real estate perspective. And this isn't just about our big mixed-use projects, because it applies with our core shopping centers too. For example, you'll see that we've added to our 8K redevelopment schedule this quarter, a $23 million 87-unit residential project at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center of City Line Avenue just outside Philadelphia. This would be our seventh residential project developed internally by our team to intensify one of our core shopping centers, the others being two at Congressional Plaza, Wynnewood Shopping Center, Chelsea Commons and Linden Square with more on the horizon.\nIn terms of Bala Cynwyd, we would expect this residential project to be just the first step of what will hopefully be an ambitious redevelopment there. It's a great example of how we continue to find ways to abstract real estate value in so much of our portfolio.\nNow, let me update you on our largest initiatives. With the 600 -- 765-unit residential neighborhood in Pike & Rose, fully 95% occupied and stabilized, and the 375,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space nearly fully leased, though not yet fully open and rent paying until later in 2019, we are ready to move forward with the next phase.\nA 212,000 square foot Class A spec office building with about 4,000 feet of retail in the ground floor, along with a 600 space parking garage that will be used by both office and retail users. The 11-story glass curtain wall building addressed as 909 Rose will sit on the hard corner of Rockville Pike and Rose Avenue, literally Pike & Rose and is expected to begin occupancy in 2021.\nOur investment will approximate a $130 million with an expected stabilized deal between six and seven. Separately, we are assessing the viability of relocating Federal's headquarters into two of the 11 stories about 40,000 square feet of the building. Doing so would validate our belief in the advance of these mixed-use neighborhoods in general and certainly, North Bethesda, specifically.\nAt Assembly Row, we're now 95% leased at the 447-unit Montaje, significantly ahead of schedule, and at net effective rents of nearly $3.40 a foot. And like our residential experience here, the Row Hotel, of which we own a 50% equity stake opened in August at Assembly, and seems to be following a similar track. Rate and occupancy are strong right out of the gate, a trend that we hope will continue through the fourth quarter and into 2019. So, the market's exuberant, acceptance of all things Assembly Row has is accelerating our plans for future development of additional residential and office products at two of the five remaining development parcels there. We're hopeful that we will be able to announce the next large phase development at Assembly in a quarter, possibly two.\nOut west, the third quarter saw a software giant Splunk signed and announced the lease for the full 300,000 feet of office space at 700 Santana Row with occupancy expected about a year from now. Get a chance to be anywhere near San Jose, be sure if it's Santana Row and feel have the end of the street has been transformed with the construction of this gorgeous building and energized plaza area below it. We expect to complete this phase of development on or slightly better than budget from a cost perspective and ahead from an incoming timing perspective.\nThe enduring strength of Silicon Valley in general and Santana Row specifically not unlike through Boston and Assembly Row as those nearing a decision to potentially move forward with additional office development at Santana West, the 12-acre parcel on Winchester Boulevard across the Santana Row that we've controlled for the past several years. Pending interest in this site due to its proximity to amenity-rich Santana has been very high leading us to accelerate our master planning of that site, stay tuned.\nAnd in Miami, demolition in CocoWalk is largely complete, and construction begins in earnest this quarter. You will note a slight increase in expected cost of the project reflected in the 8K, the result have a bit of increased scope and a bit of cost sweep, but now expected to impact projected deals noticeably. Both our retail and office leasing teams are finding strong interest, and we expect to start reporting signed deals beginning next quarter.\nA few miles away at Sunset Place, we received good new in the quarter as voters approved a ballot measure, amending the city's charter, so there are four out of five vote of the commission, rather than an unanimous one will be sufficient to a Land Use Code in the district that includes unfit place. We're working through the entitlement process now to increase the density on the site, many hospitals remain in the way of our moving forward with a viable project there mostly.\nThat's about it from my prepared remarks for the quarter. They are really good one, and we hope to follow with another and another. Let me now turn it over to Dan for some additional color, and then open the line for your questions.\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nThank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our $1.58 per share of FFO for the quarter was several cents above our expectations, and $0.03 above consensus. This outperformance was driven by higher POI through more rent and forecast, and continued expense controls at the property level, higher term fees than we had forecast, as well as lower G&A. But was again offset from the drag of early ramp-up at our two new hotels at Pike & Rose and Assembly, the latter of which just opened mid-way through the quarter.\nOur comparable POI metric was 3.5% which bested our forecast as a result of the items I just mentioned. If you remember from our last call, we had expecting this quarter to be the weakest of the year. Our continued proactive releasing activity this year provided a drag of 110 basis points although this was partially offset from the benefit of our 2017 proactive releasing efforts. Our better-than-expected termination fees enhanced the result by roughly 1%. As a reference, our former metric same-store with redev came in at 3.4%.\nDon discussed in detail our lease rollover number for the quarter of 6%. But please note that on a trailing four-quarter basis, our rollover stands at a solid 12%, in double digits, and in line with 2016 and 2017 levels. And to reemphasize let's remember, this is real estate, where true value creation should be measured over three to five to 10-year horizon, and let's not get overly focused on any one quarter's, or even any one year's metrics.\nWith respect to occupancy after a strong momentum in the second quarter, our overall leased and occupied figures were 94.8% and 93.7% respectively. Essentially flat to down slightly, but consistent with previous comparable quarters. New leases of note include industry on Third Street in Santa Monica, Fogo de Chao at Pike & Rose in North Bethesda. New openings of note includes, UNIQLO with its Montgomery County flagship location at Pike & Rose, L.A. Fitness in Del Mar in Boca, and TJ Maxx at Westgate in San Jose.\nWith the purchase from our one Toys\"R\"Us box, which is already released but not opened, and our one Bon-Ton box laying on the metrics. Also when you're next in D.C., please check out the new Anthropologie flagship location at the Bethesda Row that opened earlier this month. It's truly impressive.\nWith this stronger-than-expected quarter, we are again in a position to raise our FFO guidance increasing and tightening the range from $6.13 to $6.23 to a range of $6.18 to $6.24 per share. That represents a $0.03 increase of the midpoint from $6.18 to $6.21. At $6.21 this implies FFO growth for 2018 just above 5%, a testament to the continued consistency that all has demonstrated over its long history, even through challenging retail and economic environments. With respect to our comparable POI metric, we are also revising our outlook higher from about 3% to a mid-3% range driven by another strong quarter of 3.5% to go along with the 3.8% and 3.6% we had in the first two quarters of the year.\nNow, on to some preliminary goalposts for 2019. We are still in the midst of our 2019 budgeting process. So, I'm going to keep this very directional in nature. We expect to grow in 2019 in line with the past couple of years despite continued industry headwinds to develop a changing consumer and a general oversupply of retail space in the US. We will also face some company-specific headwinds next year. First, our G&A will grow in 2019. More detail on that on our next call. And second, we'll have some drag in FFO as we refinance our $275 million term loan which had been locked at 2.62% since its 2011 origination.\nAnd lastly the negative impact from the new lease accounting standard of $0.07 to $0.10 which I mentioned on our last call, which is reflected in these preliminary 2019 numbers. Despite these headwinds, we expect to have a solid base of growth of roughly $0.15 a share which should get us into the mid $6.30s as a lower end of the range. It is still too early in our forecast process to project how much higher we can push the upper end of a guidance range however.\nGiven the diversity of our cash flow streams and the number of different avenues that we can grow through, I would expect that an appropriate target for 2019 is to achieve growth consistent with what we have realized in 2017 and 2018, which implies high $6.40s as an upper end of the range. As I just mentioned, this takes into consideration the negative impact from the new lease accounting standard of $0.07 to $0.10, drag of roughly 1% to 1.5%, and that's an estimate where we continue to refine.\nAnd note that on an apples-to-apples basis, where 2018 FFO is adjusted for the new lease accounting standard, this implies growth in excess of roughly 4% to 6%. Again, this is preliminary, and as we did last year, we will be providing formal guidance on our fourth quarter call in February, where we will refine these targets and provide detailed assumptions behind.\nNow on to the balance sheet, which continues to improve, and is very well positioned from a capital perspective, as we head into the next phases of new development in the coming years. We continue to make progress on the condos, while already completed on the 107 market rate units at Assembly Row. At Pike & Rose, we've roughly 70% complete on a closed and under contract basis on those 99 units, with only roughly $20 million left to go.\nDuring the quarter, we closed on a sale of a small non-core asset and are under contract and close to closing on another before year-end. For a total of $42 million in gross proceeds, these two sales were executed at a blended mid-5s cap rate. We also closed on a 50% joint venture interest with our JV operating partner for the new Row Hotel at Assembly, generating $38 million of proceeds to us.\nAs a result, our credit metrics continue to improve. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio moving lower to 5.4 times for the third quarter down from 5.9 times at the start of 2018. Our fixed charge coverage ratio hedging higher to 4.3 times versus 3.9 times at the start of the year. Weighted average maturity of our debt remains above 10 years, and we are on pace to generate roughly $80 million of free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital.\nWe expect these credit metrics to continue to trend in a positive direction through the balance of 2018 and into 2019, as we raise additional capital cost effectively through opportunistic asset sales. We currently have roughly another $125 million of non-core tax efficient sale prospects in the market which we target to close over the coming quarters.\nWith that, operator, you can open up the line for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico -- Scotiabank -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning. Dan, just going back to the goalposts for 2019, when you're talking about growth in line with the past several years, are you -- is that referring to FFO growth? Or is that also same-store comparable NOI growth?\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nYes. Generally, it's -- FFO was what the -- the reference was there. We were not providing any same-store guidance at this point, and probably won't until our February call similar to what we did last year.\nNick Yulico -- Scotiabank -- Analyst\nOkay. And second question is just on the releasing spreads. And Don, you gave a lot of info there. I guess question is whether you have more of those types of leases which those escalations sound pretty attractive? That's one part.\nAnd then separately, maybe we can get a preview of how you expect the releasing spreads to look into next year? I know they had been volatilely highlighted that they would come down -- they could come down. Any numbers you could share there?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nLet me frame it Nick this way. First of all, those two leases, I think normally I wouldn't breakout a couple of leases and give you those kind of specifics on it. But that is just so economically compelling that I felt the need to do that. Now, are there a lot of big anchor boxes that have those kind of boxes? No -- those kind of bumps? I don't know if any other to tell you the truth. I mean they are -- that's really unusual, but the only reason that happens is because of productivity of the store and the strength of the market and the strength of the locations that they are in.\nSo what I'm -- the reason I do stuff like that, or talk about stuff like that is, you probably get sick of me saying those contracts were business of contracts. And that those contracts are just critical in terms of what they say to determine the value of the real estate that's underlying. And when you have deals like that, I'm sure, there are other people on this call saying wow, because they don't have deals like that -- of that kind of significance.\nNow generally, so every quarter, there is something that, as you know, I'd like the highlight or talk about that kind of feels the case for the value of the real estate. Here is no doubt that overall, pushing rents is an issue industrywide because supply exceeds demand in terms of retail rents. It's a key reason that we look hard at office and at residential as a big part of our business (technical difficulty). Once you create the overall environment on the ground floor, it's awfully nice to be able to capture real estate value by being able to do the right merchandising down because you're going to get paid for upstairs in the form of higher residential or higher office rents up there. And you know how much we believe in that.\nAlternatively or in addition to that, it really does come down to the leverage of each of the individual shopping centers that we have and we own good ones. So, I expect there the next year or two to be years of 20% and 22% and 24% rent rollover funds. No, I don't. Do I expect this still to be able to do double-digit rent bumps? Yes, I'd say, why not. That doesn't mean any particular 90 days. But certainly when we look at our loss to lease overall in this portfolio, and I love this slide that we do in our deck that shows what leases have been done at versus what the in-place is. It shows you compared to almost anybody else to look at that there is a whole lot of upside left there. But that doesn't mean across the board and everywhere that gets tougher. I hope that helps.\nNick Yulico -- Scotiabank -- Analyst\nAll right. Got it. Yes. Thank you, Don.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.\nAlexander Goldfarb -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nGood morning. So, two questions. First, Dan, you mentioned $125 million of dispositions that are in the pipeline. So, I'm not sure if that sort of guidance for full year dispositions for 2019 or not. But can you just sort of give a breakout how much of that are sort of -- are called free assets like condos, things like that that have no NOI impact versus how much of that will there be an NOI impact from?\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nYes. I mean, I think, the $125 million is just what we have and probably represents what's the first half of -- what we're targeting in the first half of the year for 2019. They are kind of income producing assets. We view them as non-core that we don't have to own long-term, and we think we should be able to achieve pricing kind of in the mid-5s on those as well. So, that's the color on those two.\nAlexander Goldfarb -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nOkay. And then the second question is having toward Pike & Rose recently, you know, one, the asset is definitely coming down more, but two, just sort of curious, you announced the second office there. Don, how do you think about the mix of residential and office as far as driving like restaurants and the other elements of the project in general? Do you view each item on its own merit, meaning which maximizes NOI for that particular land parcel? Or is there a view of which -- what's the right mix of office, residential, et cetera, that drives the overall NOI of the center? Just trying to figure that out.\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. It's a combination of both. I mean look, at the end of the day, when you're doing these type of projects, what the real trick is, is the path to maturation. All of these projects, mixed-use projects take time, take years to mature. Now do they mature in two or three, or do they mature in six or seven, or somewhere in between or more differently. One of the key ingredients to get that maturation is daytime traffic, which we're trying to get to, is a busy place as often in seven days, 24 hours a day, as possible. Office is a key user of theirs. So that daytime traffic coupled with the incredible efficiency that comes from parking that we built for office, that's necessary for office, but it's also used by the retail and other users in the evenings is a critical part of the efficiency of our mixed-use project works.\nSo, every one of these -- and you know Pike & Rose well because of the time that you've spent there. And when you look at Pike & Rose and you think of what's coming on from a retail perspective, and you see how it does on nights and weekends from the residential base that's there and the retail base that's there, you can see, well, yes, there we need to do some daytime traffic and that office is a critical component to that and part of the reason that we continue to invest that way.\nAlexander Goldfarb -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.\nChristy McElroy -- Citi -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Dan, I just wanted to follow-up on the $275 million term loan, you talked about refining that next year. I think the two swaps on that expired today, and now that's floating. Do you plan to keep that floating through the maturity next November? And when do you plan to sort of refi that or when can you, and what are your plans for that?\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nYes, it will float at LIBOR plus 90. And I think we'll look to be opportunistic in terms of refinancing that term loan. I think by extending it into 2019, it avails us to get into a little bit of the sweet spot of the market and the bank market to potentially refinance it as another term loan, or it gives us the optionality to look at it in the bond market. So, I think that we will be opportunistic in terms of refinancing that. It will be pretty open for repayments. And so we can -- there won't be any excess cost that we look to be opportunistic ahead of the November 2019 maturity.\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nBut likely '19 Christy, not '18.\nChristy McElroy -- Citi -- Analyst\nRight. Right. So keep it floating for a year, and then refi it with something fixed next November. Got it.\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nOr before that. But what I'm saying is, there won't be a refi in the fourth quarter of 2018. It will be in 2019 opportunistically.\nChristy McElroy -- Citi -- Analyst\nGot it. Got it. Okay. And then just with regard to the term fees recognizing that this is a recurring part of your business, but they did seem a little higher in Q3 than you would originally thought. What were those related to? And is this space that you were proactively trying to get back? Or did this unexpectedly come back to you?\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nA little of both. This is a good conversation. And listen, I absolutely know how you feel about term fees. And I appreciate starting out by saying that you do know the recurring part of our business, because it's -- I mean this is a business of contracts. I mean, we are like -- we want to use those contracts, do our best advantage as a tool in various numbers of ways, including the ability to proactively get tenants out, but also recognizing. This is a big part. There is a changing consumer. We don't want the same retailers over and over again. As you look over the next five, seven, nine years, we're probably less than others, about simply trying to backfill an existing box with another tenant, than we are about having an opportunity to redevelop a shopping center.\nSo, one of the tools that we use for this stuff is a strong lease. And it is just so critical to what it is that we do. When you look at this quarter, they were higher, and it's a combination of everything that you said. We lost some tenants that didn't think we were when we gave a forecast for termination fees. But we also went hard after a couple of them to be able to make sure that we were able to redevelop and keep that pipeline growing. So, you see it in both places. I don't expect term fees to be low over the next year or two. I mean if you think about the business, there is a changing of the business and a changing of retailers.\nI don't know if you've seen the list of retailers that we actively go after who are digital -- digitally based retailers who have figured out, you know what, we need the bricks and mortar presence. But that's a long list of other tenants. That's a list of tenancy that particularly for Street retail-oriented mixed-use type of products. That's a tenant base that we love to be able to access, things like Parachute Home, and others that you haven't heard necessarily a lot about, but are part of the future.\nSo, having a contract in place that strong with an existing tenant gives us the opportunity to be able to have some leverage to be able to create places for the future. And that much more than any other comparison with any other company that's what drives us in terms of what we report and what our business plan is. I know, it's long-winded, but it really is -- it's important to us to talk like that.\nChristy McElroy -- Citi -- Analyst\nSo is it fair to say that --\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nAnd also, I'll just add that --\nChristy McElroy -- Citi -- Analyst\nGo ahead.\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Christy, I just wanted to add that, you know, of the tenants that terminated in the third quarter, over two-thirds of that income has already been replaced with executive leases of tenants who are coming in. So not only did we get those term fees, those outside term fees, we've already be nimble enough to actually backfill over two-thirds of that space before we even reporting the quarter. So, I think that's a testament to kind of how proactive we are in terms of managing the process and limiting kind of cash flow downside.\nChristy McElroy -- Citi -- Analyst\nGreat. Yeah (inaudible) looking for. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeremy Metz -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. Going back to the 2019 guidance or at least the rough goalpost you laid out there, can you walk through some of the bigger pieces that could really swing you from one end to the other? I know you mentioned the term loan and the G&A, but any other bigger pieces there? And then maybe how you're thinking about bad debt and tenant follow relative to this year? It sounds like from your comments to Christy's question that you're more or less expecting a similar level of headwind on that front.\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I think it's a whole host of things. As I said, this is preliminary. I think, how quickly the hotels continue to ramp up, and Assembly and Pike & Rose can move things around a little bit. I think kind of where our -- where we see our watchlist performing over the case of -- over the course of 2019 can swing things.\nJust getting back to the two items, I mean I think even now at LIBOR plus 90, we're going to have roughly a 100 basis points of drag if we keep it floating. And if based upon where kind of six and 12-month LIBOR is projected to be, there will be some drag over the course. And that looks to be roughly $0.03 to $0.04 in the ballpark. And G&A will grow. I'm not going to get too far into the details there, but G&A will be higher in 2019, but we will provide more color on that in our February call.\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nJeremy, let me add two things to that. First of all, welcome to BMO, Metz. Good to have you back. And secondly, it is the development that are the single biggest mover. I mean, we are going to deliver to Splunk at some point around a year from now, a month one way or the other, or two months one way or the other is import, sort of how that works through.\nAnd secondly, I do want to add one thing to the G&A piece. With Weilminster and Briggs leaving, it's an awesome opportunity for the next generation here. And so we're going to do a bunch of promotions. And that's why G&A is going up. It's good stuff. It's the reason to be able to get on that Federal Realty 2.0, if you will with respect to the next level of management. So, we will talk more about that in February, but it's a critical part to us, setting us up for the next 10 years.\nJeremy Metz -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYeah. And then you talked about the ramping dispositions a bit as a source of capital, Dan, you mentioned $125 million in the first half of next year, beyond that will you look at dispositions as being more opportunistic, or if market's accommodating equity is attractive, you may be pulled back from selling? And following on that, I mean are you baking some equity into the plan at this point?\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nI mean, as I said, it's preliminary. I think that we will be opportunistic on the equity side as well. I think that it's a very limited small amount. It's kind of what's figured in to our 2019 kind of calculus providing that those goalposts will have greater refinement on kind of what that detailed assumption is in February.\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nAnd let me add one thing to that if you don't mind. In my prepared comments, I think I'll let you to a discussion of the next phases of development at Assembly, the next phases of development at Santana. You saw what we're doing at Bala with respect to the residential project there, a very strong redevelopment pipeline and core. So, as that stuff comes to fruition, this company looks at funding it including potential dispositions. But it's different in other companies, and that we don't have a bunch of shopping centers that we don't want to own. So, it's a smaller pool effectively to look at.\nNo, we don't have equity in the numbers in any significant way at this preliminary point, but we might, again very modestly or modestly as a part of balance sheet program. But a lot of it is depending upon whether we go forward, and I expect we will on building out some of these big de-risked development projects, de-risk because the places are already there and successful.\nFrom a capital perspective, we have multiple arrows in the quiver, in terms of -- I mentioned $80 million of free cash flow in 2018. We should expect similar levels in 2019 from where we sit today. I think also the balance sheet capacity as we're down, positively trending from a debt to EBITDA perspective. I think that as cash flow continues to grow, as we continue to ramp up at Assembly and Pike & Rose in 2019 and as they further stabilize that will add greater debt capacity, just very, very naturally on a leverage neutral basis. And so we got a number of different ways that we can kind of fund the development pipeline and feel really, really good about how well positioned we are heading into the final quarter of 2018.\nJeremy Metz -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Your line is open.\nSamir Khanal -- Evercore -- Analyst\nHey, guys, good morning. Don, can I ask you to take a step back and maybe talk about sort of your watch list today and compare that to last year. I mean looking here as I kind of go through the top 20, it certainly feels like there is less exposure to the tenants that will go bankrupt or liquidate which tells me kind of that 2% to 3% of same-store prior lease still is applicable for next year. But then if you look at -- you look at Bed Bath or you look at Kroger's that continue to talk down rents. I mean is there a risk that you're releasing spreads could kind of start to decelerate a little bit here going into may be the next 12 months to 24 months?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Samir, it's a good question. Look the -- and I love the way you started it, because that's definitely how I look at it. I start out with that list, that watch list, et cetera, and try to predict best we can what would effectively happen. Do I worry about Bed Bath beyond long-term? Sure, I absolutely do. And do I worry about Bed Bath beyond not honoring their commitments and paying rent? No, not at all. And somewhere -- that's a great example of an operation where I don't know how they will change their business plan. I don't think anybody does at this point whether -- how successful that will be, what that new prototype will be as they move forward in the coming years. But certainly I want to make sure we have tenants that are tenants of the future that we believe in that are -- they are to the extent, we're not part of their plans going forward.\nSo, certainly, with any tenant that's not performing as well as they were, the rent pressure ramps up. It's an obvious statement, but it's certainly the case throughout a lot of these box tenants. The key with us is the balance. And so I'm going to start to show you a little bit more of how our residential performs. I'm going to show you how our office performs. We're going to try to get this community to understand our company in its broadest -- from a broad real estate perspective. Because there are pressures coming in terms of retail lease rollover. Certainly, there are pressures. Do I see them as, oh my God, of single digit lease rollovers or (inaudible). No, I don't. So, considering this within the context of the whole company in terms of how we're moving, I think you've got to feel really good about an investment that is very likely to continue to grow in four years, simply based on what we have in pipeline today. And I don't know if there is anybody else that can say that or very many else that can say that.\nSamir Khanal -- Evercore -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks. And as we think about next year, I mean what are sort of drags we need to think about especially from a same-store perspective? I mean, there is -- one is certainly push, right. But I don't think you had a lot of exposure to those. And are there any other tenants there -- will the company be kind of moving on to a level where you will be proactively maybe taking back space like you did a couple of years because that's something to think about for 2019?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nVery much so. Very much. I mean when you go down the list, and you look at what we've got, you've got to feel really good about this and interesting. I mean, Toys -- Toys might be the best example at all. One, one that was completely released at significant bumps where Toys was in Escondido with an incredibly short amount period of time. That's done. So where -- what happens with respect to (inaudible) we've got 14 of them. When I look at the 14, you know where most of them are, they are on out parcels or end caps in great locations.\nThat's not something I particularly worried about. It doesn't mean there is not going to be some dislocation depending on what happens with the regulation of the company, but we deal with that all the time, always have been. Don't see any amount of those type of income stoppages, if you will, in a significant way any different than we'd manage through in years past certainly, and certainly better than 2016. So, yes, you have to think about proactively leasing two, we do constantly, it's not a switch that we turn on and off. It is a dial that we turn up when we see opportunities and turn down when we don't. I mean, yes, you could see that turned up a little bit again.\nSamir Khanal -- Evercore -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks so much.\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYou bet.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Schmidt -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nThank you. Don, I was wondering if gave us some description or background on rev-up, the third-party platform that Mike Kelleher is setting up?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nVery good. Well, very good for picking that up, Craig. That's cool. Not a big deal at this point at all. What that's about is when you look at this industry and you think about temporary tenant income, ancillary income, sponsorships, all of the kind of non-traditional leasing revenue generation, I'm really proud of what we build as a company over the last decade or decade and a half. And yes, Mike Kelleher has been a big part of that to be able to grow it.\nWe think we have capacity there. And we think we figured out how to do that maybe better than some other folks have. So we'd like to -- in the markets where we do significant business already, we'd like to pick up some third-party work, and spread that platform across a bigger base. It's just something that we're rolling out. We probably won't do that service for some of our direct public competitors. But there's an awful lot of regional real estate companies that really could benefit and we can share the income with them.\nSo, that's what we're messing with. I think, it's cool. I don't know if that turns into anything or not. With Kelleher on the phone right now, I would telling you, it's the greatest thing you've ever heard of, and we're going to do really well with it. We will see. But I think, more importantly, Craig, it's indicative of the creativity and the way we look at trying to add value in various different ways, big and small throughout the company.\nCraig Schmidt -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nGreat. And then the lower G&A, I'm sure was helped in some part by Dan and Chris's exit. But it looks to be more significant than that. Can you tell me what to do in there in terms of maybe getting some more cost savings?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Look, it's a big part. One of the things that I always wonder about, I think, you appreciate this is, as a company with our longevity right, we've been around a long time and we're relatively powerful in the few markets that we're in. And I think vendors and others get comfortable with that, in terms of dealing with Federal. And I don't think we used our leverage as much as potentially we could have to be able to renegotiate some of those deals and effectively reexamine scopes, reexamine financial terms with some of our partners. Now when I say partner, I mean vendor, I mean people necessary to create great shopping centers.\nWe pushed hard on that in 2018, and we push hard on that with some very favorable results. That's what you're seeing coming through. And I don't think those are one-time favorable results. I think those are benefits that are all about relooking and leveraging the power of Federal Realty, and again the five or six critical markets that we do business. And part of it is on a year-over-year basis. So, I mean, we did the Primestor acquisition in the third quarter last year, so there were transactional costs that added to G&A which we just didn't have in 2017, that we just didn't have in the third quarter of this year. So, well, that's another kind of a driver.\nCraig Schmidt -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJeff Donnelly -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. Don, I think you might have touched on this on the call, but I had heard that concerning Santana West that, you know that was a site that even Apple might have been looking at perhaps for one of their projects. That maybe market chatter, but I guess my question is do you think that's that office opportunity that needs to be a single tenant development opportunity like you had with Splunk? Or is it possible that could have something that's little more ground floor retail or residential or office on it?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Jeff is going to add -- Jeff will add to this after I just make a comment or two on it. No, this is an office project. It's an office site. It's entitled for office. Any retail that we do would be relatively insignificant. And this is real simple. And this is a 12-acre piece of land directly across and one of the most iconic, if you will, at this point, mixed-use destinations in the country. It happens to be in the middle of Silicon Valley. It's really valuable. And so whoever the tenant or tenants are, it doesn't have to be one tenant. It could be -- it can certainly be several.\nWhat we know is, we've got a piece of real estate there that is getting an awful lot of interest from some -- I will say, typical or users that you would think of, and some that you certainly wouldn't. And it just shows the broad value of the real estate because of what was created across the street. So all this has to be teased out a little bit more, but there is no denying the value of the real estate that's there.\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nYeah. Thanks for that. Jeff, I don't really have anything to add, other than if you look at all of Silicon Valley right now, there is precious little available office space or office space coming anytime soon that's amenitized. We've got at Santana West, probably one of -- handful or less than a handful of opportunities for that over the next two or three years, just given the entitlement cycle and what's going on in some of the other sub-markets around here. So, we're, like Don said, super bullish on it and there is a lot of interest in the site right now.\nJeff Donnelly -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nJeff, just I guess sticking with that, I mean, are you seeing some of the bigger employers in that market that are actually trying to tie up office space even though they might not have an immediate need for the space today just because of that dearth of space, they're sort of tying it up in anticipation of future growth?\nJeffrey Berkes -- Executive Vice President & President, West Coast\nYes and no, but remember growth is occurring very quickly out here, and the lead time on a development, even something that's entitled and ready to go is still a couple of years to build the building. So a lot of firms are growing into the requirements by the time the space actually delivers. I mean it's clearly the case with Apple, their new headquarters building from what we understand that's full. And when we look at market activity, we don't see them giving back any of their other space. So if you look at the big users out here, I think that's true they have to look out a couple of years, and by the time the space is ready, they've filled it.\nJeff Donnelly -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nMay be, Don, just stepping back more broadly on external growth, I mean your perspective on retail seems to have shifting somewhat sharply over the last few years. And you know what the prospects of it hold. Do you think as a company, you are more open to mixed-use or a mix of uses than you ever been before? And do you think the market focus, just a geographic focus of the company maybe has changed with that? Are there some markets that you are more opened to going into? Maybe one last aspect of it is, would you ever do stand-alone office or residential development away from retail?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nNo to the last question. I'm going to book in here for a minute now because (inaudible) lock. No, we won't do stand-alone or non-retail oriented resi or office as part of our business plan. I'm going to go back to your last -- I'm going to say one quick thing about your last question and that is please don't speculate about Apple. Don't speculate that. All right. They're down because that's probably not the case. Okay. Let me be clear.\nNow, let's get to what you just asked. It's not that -- here is the way I look at it. The more predictable the future is, the more narrow you can target your business plan. The less predictable the future is, the more you want to be able to have to be as flexible, and it's the most important word in our business plan, as flexible as you possibly can. Flexibility with respect to what the future holds simply means to me, I'd like to be able to not rely on any one income stream. And if that's the rolling forward of rents in a basic shopping center, that's one thing.\nIf it is, do I want to have the ability to create value upstairs on land in the markets that we're in that are densifying anyway. Of course, I do. It's not -- it really isn't about liking mixed-use or not liking mixed-use, or liking a shopping center or not liking a shopping center. The reality is what our core competency is, is first-ring suburbs creating great places for people to go to. That can be a grocery-anchored shopping center, it can be a mixed-use project, it can be whatever else it is. Once you have them there, that's not necessary in Manhattan, that's a corner of 57th and 5th. That environment already exists, where you can do an independent any kind of building. The people are already there. That's not the case in the first-ring suburbs where we are doing most of our business. We don't have to bring people there.\nNow once you have them, how do you make more money? And that's where you have to say whether it's buying adjacent parcels and growing on them, whether it's going up in office or retail, if I look out at an unpredictable future, I want as many arrows in the quiver that possibly can have. That's what I think, we've done. So, I don't see it as a sharp change in believing in retail or not, believing in retail. I think it's a evolutionary change in the unpredictability of technology's impact on the consumer.\nAnd so when you think about it that way, what you guys do about that if you're real estate company, not a retailer, but a real estate company, you make sure your real estate is valuable in any one of the number of different ways. And I think we've proven pretty well a core competency in the ability to look more broadly as real estate people rather than simply shopping center people.\nJeff Donnelly -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nYea. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMike Mueller -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nHi. Couple of questions. First, Dan, when you are talking about 2019, you flagged G&A and then lease accounting separately. So, is your lease accounting expenses -- is that going to be in operating expenses?\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nNo, no, no. There will be a component of increase in our G&A in 2019, part of it will be lease accounting related. The lease accounting teams geographically will set up the G&A item. But we will also have a -- in our current level of G&A, there will also be an increase which -- so there's two pieces to that.\nMike Mueller -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nGot it. Okay. And then I guess just thinking about tenant demand and everything. On the mall calls, you constantly hear about retailers and demand and moving into the malls. I'm just curious, in terms of your portfolio, are you seeing that sort of interest as well from those types of tenants?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Mike, this is -- I've talked about it earlier in one of the questions, but think about this for a minute. Of all of these e-tailers, basically let's start and say online retailers who have started online, these guys, all of them, I didn't say all, but most are struggling, and always struggled with typical things you struggle in a business with, number one being customer acquisition cost. How do I get that customer and what it cost me to get to them, and of course then the delivery system. And those two things have led many of them to the conclusion that you know what we need a physical presence. And I've got some interesting stuff that I'll share outside of this, maybe at NAREIT next week, of some of the quotes and some of the plans that these guys have.\nNow when you say, OK, where are they going to go, the chances to me are -- look awfully good for the type of properties that we own. We're close to a lease for one of those tenants that we're talking about in Bethesda Row right now. We are close on two at Santana Row right now. The streets that we have presence on, like Third Street Promenade, I mean, these are -- it's I don't know how important the component of the future it is, but it is certainly a component of the future, and going back to where it was before, we want to catch the broadest, widest funnel to be able to be attractive to the largest possible number of retailers. And where we are suggest to me that we'll have more than our fair share of those tenants who are finding the need for bricks and mortar stores.\nMike Mueller -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nOkay. That was it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nHaendel Juste -- Mizuho -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. Lots of call, lots of detail, much appreciated. My question for you, Don, I guess more a big picture, we've seen a lot of M&A this year in the REITs, but nothing in the shopping centers. Curious why you think that is? And then is there anything you expect over the next year that Federal could participate in?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nHaendel, this is -- I mean we've been talking about this question for 20-plus years and that's just what I remember, so I'm sure it goes before that. Look, the idea of combining platforms has to have a business sense to it that makes all the sense in the world obviously what you saw with Equity One and Regency was indicative of that. I think you can look at that and say, yes, that company is better off than the two companies separately would have been. But those things are few and far between, they are had to do. I'd love to tell the story of -- I don't know, if (inaudible) mad at me for say it or not, but we have a very good relationship and back before they were public, we were trying very hard to put those companies together, didn't work out, they went public, are doing great.\nSo we come down to the individual business plans. It comes down to the social issues that are part and parcel to it. And when you think about betting on the future, there is almost always dilution from the buyer side initially for a period of time. So you have to be comfortable with where that future is going and what it is going to provide. That's harder to do today than that's been in other periods.\nSo the combination of other things. Is Federal involved in anything that's possible for us, you bet. We talk a lot -- we talked to a lot of people, a lot of the time, but we're not going to do something that doesn't improve the prospects versus our existing plan. And our existing plan is really good in terms of this real estate. Our real estate clearly will be worth more in the future than it is today. When I sit and I look at the prospects for growth for domination in certain -- at certain properties that is the consideration of properties, et cetera. So any kind of deal from a merger perspective or anything else have to be incrementally significantly better than that, I haven't found that.\nHaendel Juste -- Mizuho -- Analyst\nHelpful, Don. Thank you. And just a follow-up on the mid-5 capital expectations for the assets under discussion for disposition here. Curious where you think those assets might have traded 12 months to 18 months ago? And then how large would you say your bucket of non-core, but tax efficient potential asset sales bucket is?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nI'm going to jump in before Dan is here on a minute, because I cringed when he said that. When he said mid-5s because listen, we'll see based on the marketplace what those assets will trade at, what they won't trade at. The answer to your question how does that compare, I don't know. That's what I'd love to see as part of this. And it is a small bucket. And then kind of looking into that before a little bit. It is a small bucket because we sit and we look at the future earnings prospects of the assets, and the -- far and away most of the assets at this company. And again there's only 104 of them. Most of those assets have really bright futures. To the extent they don't, we'll find a way to effectively recycle out of them, but that -- we're talking about six, seven, eight assets, based on information that we have today, in terms looking at the future that would fall into that bucket.\nHaendel Juste -- Mizuho -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Derek Johnson with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nShivani Sood -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nHi. This is Shivani Sood on for Derek Johnson. The office aspect of the portfolio has been a large focus of today's call. So would you mind just speaking to the leasing fund there. How the process and potential CapEx involve might differ from the retail aspect of the portfolio? And also kind of how you view it from an operating metric perspective?\nDaniel Guglielmone -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer\nYeah. Sure. It's a good question. I'm not sure that -- well, I am sure that we don't have a view on office product in a national way or in a stand-alone office product. What we do know is places where we have created an environment with retail on that ground floor that is amenity-rich is more and more and more attractive to office users. And as a result, in places where we have the land, and again our average shopping center is 20 acres large, which is big compared to more shopping centers. We have the opportunity at various places to be able to exploit that retail environment that we've created.\nIn some cases, we've seen it at Pike & Rose with the first phase we've certainly seen it at Santana Row. Even though there are other opportunities in the marketplace for office, the office user sees those opportunities as irrelevant and obsolete. And so we think we have something that's particularly special that can drive a premium rent and that can drive premium bumps in those rental deals. And most importantly, it's so integral to the overall property that we're developing or building or community that we are building that it's really part and parcel of how the retail works, how the resi works, it provides the daytime traffic.\nAs I said before, that's critical. It is a immensely efficient in terms of the parking. And so office brokers bring the product to us. And so it's -- these are negotiated similar to any other office deals with the same criteria for capital, the same criteria for rent, et cetera. We just feel like we're in a stronger position to be able to be at the top of the range of those market conditions on all the economic aspects, because of what we've invested down on the ground floor.\nSo you won't see us doing separate office buildings across the country to broaden our -- what our basic core competency is. But we certainly will at the properties that we've created great places, exploit that. And to me, that office product where we are building whether it's Santana or Assembly or Pike & Rose, that office product is de-risked to a huge degree because of the significant investment that has been made in the place previous to that.\nShivani Sood -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks so much for that color. And then just given the more diverse pool of assets that FRT owns than peers, for example, power centers, grocery-anchored, mixed-use. Can you just give us an update in terms of retailer demand for the different property types and if that's shifted at all over the past year or so?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nNo. And I will tell you what because I know it's simpler to say power centers performed like this, and grocery-anchored performed like this, and mixed-use performed like that, et cetera. It's just not true. It's totally depends on physically where that property is in the supply and demand characteristics at that particular piece of real estate. So, I spent a bunch of time on that call talking about leases at a power center called East Bay Bridge in Emeryville, California. It's an incredible powerful supply demand environment for us, because there is no other supply of that. So, no, and I can make those same kind of comments for each one. You're really got to get into the individual real estate. It's not a compound. I know it sounds like one. But I really fight hard about the characterization of any particular type even though I understand these -- it's easier for you to categorize. Sorry.\nShivani Sood -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nThanks. That's it for us.\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nOkay.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nThanks. So already a lot of good questions have been asked by my peers. So just one last one from me. If you could wave a magic wand and get any piece of technology to help your business, what would that be?\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nI keep doing this the last question and it's the most cerebral here for crying out loud, good for you. There's an interesting thing going on right now and it's obviously all about data. And how much data is available and every two person consulting firm who is selling their idea of what data you need and what would really matter. The answer to that question in my mind and I don't think my peers agree with me necessarily on this, but the answer to that question has not -- is not clear. There is so much information out there. The one thing that I think we all have to be careful about is running out and investing and pulling in a whole bunch of data that it turns out really isn't impactful to the lease negotiation or to the deal negotiation in the form of an acquisition, et cetera.\nThe obvious pieces of data and information are clear. It's certainly sales per square foot, it's certainly profitability, it's certainly the supply effectively, certainly understanding where your customers are coming from. But when you say what one piece is there, it gets toe myopic in my view. I don't think there is one piece. And so we're dealing with all that now. We're talking with a lot of vendors. We are talking with the potential partners. We're talking with companies that are trying to marry retailers with landlords doing all the right things. But really trying to figure out where to invest in information that will make a difference, that's still gray.\nKi Bin Kim -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nYeah, I get what your saying. I've seen a few pictures and I know what my problem is, my problem is that everything sounds great. So, I get you. All right. Thank you.\nDonald C. Wood -- President & Chief Executive Officer\nAbsolutely. You bet.\nOperator\nThank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Leah Brady for any further remarks.\nLeah Andress Brady -- Investor Relations Manager\nThanks for joining us today.
