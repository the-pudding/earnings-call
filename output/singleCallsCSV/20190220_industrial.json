Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Industrial Logistics Properties Trust or ILPT. This is my first earnings call as President of ILPT. I'm enthusiastic about the outlook for this Company and our opportunities to create value for our shareholders.\nThis morning, we reported fourth quarter normalized FFO of $25.9 million or $0.40 per share. As of the end of the fourth quarter, ILPT's portfolio consisted of 270 primarily warehouse and distribution properties with 29.5 million square feet located in 26 states. Approximately 58% of ILPT's annualized revenues came from 16.8 million square feet of industrial land located on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Our Mainland portfolio consisted of 44 buildings, 12.7 million square feet, located in 25 states that were 100% leased with an average lease term of approximately eight years as of quarter-end.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continue to execute on our business plan with strong leasing activity and Mainland acquisitions. We entered new and renewal leases and completed rent resets for a total of approximately 1.9 million square feet at rents that were 23.7% higher than prior rents for the same space.\nThe average lease term for new and renewal leases was 14.4 years and leasing capital per square foot per lease year was $0.06. Including rent resets, leasing capital per square foot per lease year was approximately $0.01.\nPortfolio occupancy as of the end of the fourth quarter was 99.3%, unchanged from last quarter and down from 99.9% for the prior year. We have no near-term lease expirations on the mainland with only 0.3% of total annualized rents expiring this year and less than 2% expiring by the end of 2020.\nMoving to Hawaii, we have 478,000 square feet of leases for $1.9 million of total annualized rent scheduled to expire during 2019, in addition to 1.8 million square feet for $5.9 million of annualized rent that is scheduled to reset. Nearly 50% of our Hawaii leases mark-to-market is through rent resets or as leases roll-over over the next five years. We continue to be encouraged by our leasing results and our expectation is the rents will continue to increase in Hawaii due to the unique characteristics of these properties.\nMoving on to acquisitions, as previously discussed, during the fourth quarter, we acquired one property in Maple Grove, Minnesota and one land parcel in Ankeny, Iowa, both of which were discussed in detail on our third quarter earnings call.\nSince year-end, we have remained active and recently announced the 10-year $650 million mortgage financing on a portfolio of our Hawaii properties, which Rick will discuss in a few minutes, as well as two large portfolio acquisitions.\nLast week, we agreed to acquire a portfolio of eight properties with an aggregate of approximately 4.2 million square feet for a purchase price of $280 million and a GAAP cap rate of 6% and the current cash cap rate of 5.8%. We have closed on seven of the eight properties. One is still in due diligence, but expected to close in the next 60 days. This portfolio is located in the Indianapolis and Cincinnati market areas, is 100% leased to 10 tenants and has a weighted average remaining lease term of 4.4 years, a weighted average building age of 13 years and a weighted average clear height of 34 feet. Approximately 59% of our annualized rental revenue from this portfolio is paid by investment grade-rated tenants, including Amazon, Whirlpool, Cummins and Stanley Black & Decker.\nLast week, we also entered an agreement to acquire a portfolio of 18 properties with an aggregate of approximately 8.7 million square feet for a purchase price of $625.3 million, at a GAAP cap rate of 6.4% and the current cash cap rate of 5.9%. This portfolio is located in 12 states, is 100% leased to 13 tenants and has a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.4 years, a weighted average building age of nine years and a weighted average clear height of 33 feet. Approximately 74% of our annualized rental revenues from this portfolio is paid by investment grade-rated tenants, including Amazon, Procter & Gamble, UPS and FedEx. This acquisition is expected to close in the next 60 days.\nI think Rick will note this again in his comments, but over 70% of the purchase price of these two portfolio transactions was -- will be funded with proceeds of a $650 million loan that effectively unlocked some of the hidden value in our Hawaii industrial land. Including these two portfolios, we have acquired over $1 billion of high quality industrial properties since our IPO last January. We remain confident the demand for our properties will continue to be supported by the growth of e-commerce and logistics industries and the strength of the nationwide industrial market.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rick Seidel to provide details on this quarter's financial results.\nRichard W. Siedel -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Normalized FFO for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $25.9 million or $0.40 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $30.9 million. Our quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share continued to be well covered with a comfortable payout ratio of 82.5%. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased by $2.7 million to $42.1 million, representing a 6.8% increase over prior year results. This increase primarily reflects our acquisition activity as well as lease renewals and rent resets at our Hawaii properties. Same property cash NOI increased by 1.2% over the prior year, primarily as a result of contractual rent increases and leasing activity across the portfolio, partially offset by increased non-recoverable expenses, which included rent reserves for our Hawaii tenant in default along with real estate taxes, and security costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $2.9 million or just under 20 basis points of our total assets as of year-end, which was substantially lower than the year-ago quarter, which included costs related to preparing the Company to go public.\nOur recurring capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $3.4 million. The majority of these expenditures releasing capital, specifically tenant improvements that we will recover over the lease term and lease commissions related to a Mainland lease extension. We finished the year with $413 million outstanding on our revolver, resulting in debt to EBITDA of 3.7 times.\nAs John briefly mentioned earlier, on January 29, we announced a 10-year $650 million mortgage financing at 4.3% on our select portfolio of 186 of our Hawaii properties, containing an aggregate of approximately 9.6 million square feet or about 57% of our total square footage in Hawaii.\nThe properties are almost all situated between the Honolulu central business district, the airport and the seaport. The loan was financed at around 45% loan to value based on the appraised value of more than $1.4 billion. The net book value of these properties on our balance sheet was less than $500 million at year-end, signaling the tremendous growth in value of this portfolio since it was acquired in 2013. We believe this transaction highlights the under-appreciated value and quality of our Hawaiian assets and provides us with low cost fixed rate capital to fund the external growth John discussed.\nProceeds from the mortgage were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility as well as to partially fund the portfolio acquisitions John discussed earlier. In the few days since we announced the two recent acquisition agreements, we have heard investor concerns about our leverage level and fear about equity issuances or asset sales. We do not plan to run at this leverage level forever, but we are comfortable with at this level because we are stable, predictable and growing cash flows and a well covered dividend\nWe may, in the future, seek an investment-grade rating, but ILPT is still a new company and relatively small versus its peers. We don't plan to seek an investment-grade rating in 2019 and accordingly are comfortable with higher leverage levels, which will allow for greater accretion and more flexibility to increase our dividend once the transactions close.\nOne last thing to mention before Q&A, we wanted to remind everyone that shortly before year-end, Select Income REIT distributed all 45 million shares of ILPT that it owned to its shareholders. We are optimistic with the elimination of a 70% controlling shareholder and the related significant increase in our public float, ILPT may begin to trade at multiples more in line with our industrial REIT peers.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bryan Maher with B.Riley FBR. Please go ahead.\nBryan Maher -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. A couple of quick questions. On the back of the supplemental, you do have the list of all the properties that ILPT has. When might we get the list of the properties that are being acquired here in the first quarter?\nRichard W. Siedel -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nBryan, we would typically plan to file that with the next supplemental, but we will be filing 8-K with the purchase agreements. I'm trying to think if the list is included in the agreements, I believe it is, but we'll look at that information after.\nBryan Maher -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst\nThat would be great because that's one of the biggest questions I've been getting from investors is what exactly did you buy. The second question I have is how are those properties sourced, was it brokered or how did you come across that?\nJohn Murray -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThe eight-property $280 million transaction came through brokers. The CCIT II 18-property acquisition was privately sourced. It was an off-market transaction.\nBryan Maher -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst\nOkay. And then suffice it to say, given your comments on investor concerns that have been related to you, as it relates to leverage at this point in time, should we expect a material slowdown in acquisition activity for at least the next couple of quarters while you digest these transactions and leverage comes down a bit? How should we think about that for modeling purposes?\nJohn Murray -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I think we were opportunistic. We had raised a substantial amount of debt capital through the loan on the Hawaii properties. One of the transactions came to our attention in the early stages of that financing and so we didn't -- we weren't planning to do this volume of acquisitions as quickly as it turned out that we did. So I think it's reasonable to expect that we'll -- that you'll see very little in the way of acquisition -- additional acquisitions from us for the next couple of quarters. We'll be focused on getting these properties. Only seven of the eight in one portfolio have closed and the others are -- will close in the next month or two. So we're going to be focused on that and not as much on acquisition activity.\nBryan Maher -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst\nAnd then just lastly, when you think about the split with the Company between Hawaii and Mainland, whether you want to look at it as NOI or annual revenues, how are you guys looking at that split between pre these two acquisitions and post these two transactions, and should we continue to expect future transactions being predominantly, if not all, Mainland?\nRichard W. Siedel -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nBrian, I would say the easiest way to look at it before we've fully integrated the properties and filed the performance related to and everything else is probably revenue, and we're essentially expecting a bit of a flip. I think we'll got to -- just under 60% will be Mainland as compared to where we were previously with 60% in Hawaii. We would love to buy more properties in Hawaii, it's a market we know well, it is a strong market, but there's not a lot of ground that comes up for sale. So for that reason, we've expect -- we've always expected most of our acquisition opportunities to come on the Mainland, and we are just as excited about Mainland opportunities because, again, the long-term trends in e-commerce, we think are fantastic and are going to drive rents higher for industrial space.\nThe one other thing I would say just about the properties that we've added, we've always said that our Hawaii properties were incredibly secure because of the structure of the ground leases, and even though we've increased our exposure to Mainland, we've picked up a bunch of really great credit quality tenants. So our percentage of investment grade on the Mainland goes up after these acquisitions from around 49% around 59%, so we've upgraded the credit quality of our Mainland tenants. And overall, when you factor in the Hawaii leased land and all the investment grade-rated tenants and subs with investment grade-rated tenants, our overall portfolio only changes about 1% or so from 73.5 to 72 and change. So overall, we didn't really dilute the credit quality at all, which is tough when you factor in how strong our Hawaii properties are. So overall, we feel really good about portfolio and are excited to see it grow.\nBryan Maher -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst\nThank you. That's all from me.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYes, thanks. Can you guys talk a little bit about how you plan on de-levering the balance sheet? I know that you said you're comfortable with these levels here in the near future, but how long you'r willing to run at these levels and what's the plans to get leverage back down to your target of about 65 (ph)?\nJohn Murray -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. We really don't feel like there's any special pressure to de-lever quickly. We think that as the value of this -- these two portfolios is demonstrated and the additional cash flow becomes evident, that we're hopeful that our share price will appreciate, but we could wait until next year before thinking about de-levering. In the meantime, we're generating a lot of cash flow. I think probably the portfolio would naturally de-lever itself with no real capital raises in three or four years. So we think that there are opportunities. We think there is a -- there was a lot of unlock value in the Hawaii portfolio, which we unlocked in the secured financing that we did earlier. We think there may be opportunities if the share price doesn't react positively over time that there -- we have a lot of very high quality mainland properties, and we could access equity through potential joint venture opportunities or structures like that. So -- but we're not actively engaged with anybody to evaluate that because, right now, the focus is on getting these two transactions closed and focusing on the balance of the year with -- and where where our dividend goes.\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAnd are you willing to sit on the sidelines not deploying any additional capital on the acquisitions until you bring leverage a little bit lower. Is that kind of the plan right now and letting that cash flow to de-lever your balance sheet?\nJohn Murray -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI mean, we'll always keep an eye on the acquisitions market, and I think if we saw something that was too much to pass-up, that I'd never say never on completely shutting down, but I don't expect that you'll see acquisitions from us for the next couple of quarters at least. And so I'd say, yes, we are comfortable with that. I mean, we've -- I mean -- the initial reactions from some investors were that this is too much growth too fast. So it's a little bit surprising that you're wondering if we can hold back now. But I think that we need to focus on getting these two transactions closed and absorbed into our portfolio. So -- and we're comfortable doing that. It's been more than 50% growth of our asset base. So I think that that's pretty substantial amount of growth. So I don't think anyone would fault us if we don't have additional acquisitions this year.\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAnd then at what point do you pursue a joint venture? Is that a few quarters down the road if you don't see the stock price react the way you want? Do you start those discussions in the next few quarters or when does those happen?\nJohn Murray -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe don't have a specific plan yet, so it's probably too early to answer that question, but I think we wouldn't probably get going on that type of a possibility for a couple of quarters and my guess, it would be several quarters a year before something like that came to fruition. If it's an avenue, we actually go down.\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. And then can you provide some color on the Hawaiian lease renewal that occurred in the fourth quarter? I'm assuming that was an old renewal from the 2019 expiration. And if that's the case, when does that lease actually commence?\nRichard W. Siedel -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nThe leasing activity this quarter, it did include a fairly large parcel out in Campbell estate or the Western properties there. I think that was effective January 1st. So we'll see the roll-up immediately.\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. And then, Rick, can you provide an update on American Tire Distributors? I think that process has played out. I'm assuming all your leases have been affirmed. Is that correct?\nRichard W. Siedel -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nThat is correct. So they lease five properties from us. They were one of our larger tenants at about 3% of annualized rents. They again filed the prepack bankruptcy, they did a debt equity swap, and they've assumed all five of our leases. So we feel pretty good about it. They've remained current on rent, and again, it worked out kind of the way we hoped it would.\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. And then how much term do you have left on those leases?\nRichard W. Siedel -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nThere's a fair amount of term left, I believe. I don't have it in front of me. Last quarter, I was prepped on all of that stuff and had gone property by property, but now that it's much less of a focus, I don't recall off the top of my head, but there is still a good amount of term left in all and strong markets. I believe our team thought we could possibly roll-up rents if we needed to retenant them, so again, we feel really good about those properties.\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Murray for any closing remarks.\nJohn Murray -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you. We are very pleased with our financing in Hawaii that highlights and unlocks the value and quality of these unique assets, and we look forward to the meaningful earnings impact from our latest acquisitions in future quarters. Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call.\nOperator\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.
