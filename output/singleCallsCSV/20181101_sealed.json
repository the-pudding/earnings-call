Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ted Doheny, our President and CEO.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Lori. Welcome to Sealed Air's Third Quarter Conference Call. First, I'll recap our third quarter results. Second, I will share actions we are taking to improve our performance. And lastly, I'll provide an update on our profitable growth strategy and how our focus on operational excellence will drive a step change in our future results.\nIn the third quarter, net sales were $1.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $299 and adjusted EPS was $0.61. We increased sales on a constant dollar basis by 8%, yet EBITDA was only up 4%. This lack of operating leverage was disappointing. As soon as we were aware of the shortfall we wanted to be transparent, which is why we pre-announced on October 17. Given our global footprint, we recognize we are facing unfavorable currency higher input and freight costs in geographic challenges stemming from tariffs.\nFood Care manage through these headwinds in the quarter, while the impact on Product Care was more pronounced. Let me briefly unpack the quarter by division. We delivered a strong third quarter in Food Care despite currency headwinds and higher input and freight costs. Constant dollar sales were up 6% and adjusted EBITDA was up 10%. Operating leverage improved sequentially and it was encouraging to see some of the actions we took just last quarter had an impact on our results.\nThere is still more work to do on productivity and efficiency and Food Care and that work is currently under way. Product here on the other hand fell short of expectations, constant dollar sales growth was up 12%. Yet, adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat compared to last year and operating leverage was negative. We are not satisfied with this performance and we are addressing the issue head on. Global volumes were down 2% in the quarter with a 7% drop in our utility business, this business accounts for 30% of Product Care sales. Competition across our utility portfolio intensified in North America and the UK, and we experienced a slowdown in China due to tariff uncertainties. We're making process on upgrading many of our customers to more sustainable and automated solutions, but the shift is not happening fast enough. We're accelerating our actions in Product Care to take cost out of the business, while at the same time strengthening our sustainability and automated solutions portfolio.\nThe actions currently under way are being funded by our existing restructuring program. We expect our efforts to eliminate stranded costs from the Diversey sale to be largely complete by year-end which is six months to nine months ahead of plan. This accelerated effort will result in $40 million of annualized savings realized in 2018 as compared to our prior expectation of $30 million. In 2019, we expect to realize another $25 million of annualized savings from these efforts. The projects remaining are being prioritized to address Product Care as quickly as possible.\nTo achieve operational excellence across our entire organization we're redesigning our operating model. This encompasses how we innovate, buy, make and sell. We expect to announce in more detailed company wide plan before year end to enhance efficiency and productivity in four areas; SG&A, product cost, speed-to-market on innovation and channel optimization.\nTaking a step back. I'd like to spend a few minutes on our market opportunities. With respect to Food Care, we delivered 6% constant dollar growth while the protein markets we serve were essentially flat. We benefited from both an increase in our core products in continued market penetration of our new innovations. Sales of our case-ready platform had continued to increase in all regions. Within this platform, we're seeing incremental sales from our sustainable trays and lids that offer extended shelf life, higher consumer appeal, and already meet our 2025 sustainability in plastics pledge.\nThe pipeline for our flex prep solution for the fluids market continues to expand and we're investing in capacity to support future growth. This solution which integrates equipment, materials and dispensing technologies provide significant savings to the food processor as well as to the quick service restaurant industry. We are confident Food Care will continue to deliver above market growth rates on the top line while driving strong operating leverage.\nMoving now to Product Care. We're focusing on growth areas that are top of mind with our customers, sustainability and automation. As a result, we're seeing growth in our bubble wrap on demand platform, automated systems including I-Pack, Flow Wrap, Stealth Wrap, paper systems and core view all of which are designed to minimize waste, reduce damage and/or eliminate the need for a box. Today, these value added e-commerce and fulfillment solutions combined make up 20% our Product Care sales and year-to-date have grown 10%. The highest growth is coming from our bubble wrap on demand platform. We're driving more growth from automated packaging solutions. Another growth area we see in 2019 is within our B2B offerings or a specialty industrial applications which today accounts for approximately 40% of our sales and has been growing in the low single digits. Our B2B customers are increasing pressure to modify their packaging for the small parcel e-commerce fulfillment network, a trend you first talk about called ship in own container or SIOC.\nWith the integration of Fagerdala in AFP acquisitions, we now have an advanced end-to-end offering with integrated fabrication capabilities and our specialty foam in Instapak solutions. Focusing our efforts on our differentiated portfolio in streamlining our utility business will lead to improved EBITDA margins and Product Care. Let me now shift to an important topic embedded in our strategy, sustainability. I'm excited to share that we've announced a bold new sustainability and plastics pledge committing to delivering 100% recyclable and reusable offerings by 2025. In addition to accelerating our sustainability efforts within our organization, we will collaborate with partners around the world to increase recycling and reusable rates. This commitment aligns with our mission as a company to lead the industry to a more sustainable future. I will now pass the call to Bill to review the third quarter results and our outlook. Bill?\nWilliam Stiehl -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Ted. Let's start with the review of our net sales by region on slide six. In the third quarter, sales increased 5% as reported and 8% in constant dollars. We delivered constant dollar growth across all regions. North America was up 6% and 3% on an organic basis, or excluding currency and acquisitions. Food Care North America was up 4%, Product Care North America increased 9% including acquisitions and 2% on an organic basis.\nEMEA was up 2%, with positive trends in the UK, Italy, Germany and Russia. Asia Pacific increased 18% in constant dollars and 2% on an organic basis. Food Care Asia Pacific was up 4% driven by growth in Australia and in New Zealand. Latin America was up 1% as reported and 24% in constant dollars. Volume was up 7% due to increased demand in Brazil, Mexico, where we benefited from new business and a stronger export market within our Food Care customer base. On slide seven, we present our year-to-date performance. Sales were up 7% on an as reported basis and in constant dollars, with positive trends across all regions.\nSlide eight highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. In the third quarter, on a global basis, we delivered favorable price mix of 4%. Price mix was favorable in Food Care and Product Care due to previously announced price increases, formula pass-throughs and continued shift to value-added solutions. We were able to get positive price realization in Latin America to offset the currency devaluation. Volume was up 1% globally. Food Care volumes were up 3% with positive trends in all regions. Product Care volumes, excluding acquisitions, declined 2% globally due to a 3% decline in North America, primarily related to our utility business.\nOn slide nine, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the third quarter. I covered sales trends in the last two slides. So my comments now will focus on EBITDA performance. Adjusted EBITDA of $219 million increased 4% on a constant dollar basis. Margins were down 70 basis points to 18.5%. Favorable mix and price cost spread of $17 million, restructuring savings of $11 million and volume of $3 million were offset by higher operating costs.of $22 million. Higher operating costs were related to salary and wage inflation, rising non-material manufacturing cost and investments to support our growth programs. Unfavorable currency was $7 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.61 on average diluted shares outstanding of 158 million shares. Our adjusted tax rate was 28% in the third quarter. We now estimate that our full-year adjusted tax rate is going to be 27%, which is in line with our year-to-date adjusted rate.\nSlide 10 displays our year-to-date sales and EBITDA bridges. Focusing on our year-to-date EBITDA performance, higher volumes, favorable mix and price cost spread and restructuring savings were offset by higher operating costs. Turning to our results by division, on slide 11, we present Q3 and year-to-date results for our Food Care division.\nWe were pleased with Food Care's results in the third quarter, especially in light of the currency headwinds. Sales were up 6% in constant dollars to $727 million due to higher volumes and favorable price mix. As we anticipated, equipment sales returned to growth in the quarter and we expect this trend to continue into year-end. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% in constant dollars to $145 million or 20% of net sales.\nFood Care delivered strong operating leverage and you can see from this bridge that we continue to invest in our operations to support future growth and improved manufacturing efficiency. On slide 12, we highlight results from our Product Care division. In the third quarter, Product Care net sales increased 12% in constant dollars to $459 million. Excluding acquisitions, Product Care sales were up 1%. Adjusted EBITDA of $76 million was essentially flat compared to last year. As indicated in the EBITDA bridge, margin was under pressure as favorable mix and price cost spread was more than offset by lower sales volumes and higher operating costs.\nLet's now turn to our free cash flow for the nine months on slide 13. Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30 was a source of cash of $80 million, and that includes $42 million of the one-time payment we made in January of 2018 to an outside engineering firm, in lieu of certain future royalties.\nTo-date, capital expenditures were $115 million. Interest payments, net of interest income, were $125 million and cash tax payments were $137 million. Restructuring payments dedicated to our core operations were $7 million. Turning to our total company 2018 outlook on slide 14. I want to reiterate our 2018 guidance that we outlined on October 17. Full-year net sales are now expected to be $4.7 billion or 5% growth as reported and 6% growth in constant dollars.\nBy division, we continue to anticipate 4% constant dollar growth in Food Care. For Product Care, we now forecast 9% constant dollar growth as compared to our previous 11% expectation. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45, and I would like to highlight that this represents an increase of approximately 35% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year is expected to be approximately $870 million to $880 million, which is an increase of 6%. Currency is expected to have a negative impact on full-year 2018 net sales and adjusted EBITDA of $40 million and $10 million respectively. Unfavorable currency will impact our Food Care results due to its exposure to Europe, to Latin America and Australia .\nFor the full year, our outlook for free cash flow is $350 million. Cash tax payments are now expected to be $165 million. CapEx is on track to be $160 million and interest, net of interest income, is expected to be $175 million. Cash restructuring payments, dedicated to our core operations, are expected to be $15 million. Stranded costs restructuring payments, which are excluded from our $350 million free cash flow outlook, are expected to be $25 million. Our efforts to eliminate stranded costs will be largely complete by the end of 2018. Heading into 2019, we will incur the remaining $35 million in restructuring payments under our existing program, most of which will be directed toward our core operations. The cumulative restructuring payments incurred in 2018 and 2019 of $75 million are in line with our prior expectations. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Ted so he can conclude our prepared remarks.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Bill. In summary, we know we have a lot of work to do. We are redesigning our operating model with a focus on efficiency and productivity improvements, and look forward to sharing our plans before year-end. We clearly see the power of our iconic brand, differentiated technology, leading market position, and deep customer relationships with more value to be captured in existing and adjacent markets. We look forward to discussing our efforts to achieve higher and accelerating returns on our innovations and become a more efficient organization. Our focus is to drive profitable growth at Sealed Air and enhance value for our customers, our people and our shareholders. With that, I now open up the call for questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.\nMolly Baum -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi this is actually Molly sitting in for George, we had a few other calls overlapping today. But could you just give some more detail on where competition is gaining on you In the utility areas, protective packaging and kind of more detail on how you're comparing this with your automated system? Thank you.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. First of all on the Product Care, the issue that we had there with, we talked about our rising costs we had from currency etcetera, etcetera. But as far as the competition on the price on the volume where we don't have an automated solution, we would lose out. We think we do need to work continue to take our cost out of the product and also to drive more of our automated solutions.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please?\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. You may proceed.\nGhansham Panjabi -- Baird -- Analyst\nHey guys, good morning. I guess just following up on the last question on Product Care, looking back over time, Ted, I mean significant price increases have been instituted in the past for this segment, including the utility sub segment I would presume, what was different this particular time around, you still have the same number of competitors? It seems like, was there any sort of element of de-stocking of inventory at the end market and also on your comments on tariffs, can you just expand on that in terms of the impact? Thank you.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, and I apologize I didn't do a good job of first question, because I was moving my papers around. On the Product Care, what's moving in the market as we drive to the automated solution, we got to get our cost down on our products. And so that's what we're fighting with. The issue is raising price on rising costs is not sustainable. We have to take the cost out of those products. What we call as a commodity product is actually the materials that are going into the packaging solutions. We have to take that cost down and we have to take significant action on that. Our productivity has not gained and we needed to work on that.\nThe second piece where the market is going, for instance, in Product Care, where one person with loaded package, that's moving now to a semi-automated state where I shared with our Bubble Wrap on-demand system where instead of a person who can load four, five a minute with no Bubble Wrap on-demand, we can double that. But where the market is going, how do we go to a lights out warehouse, how do we go to fully automated into systems like our flow wrap or a stealth wrap. Those are actually taking our shrink film materials and driving to a much, much higher level of automation. So we need to do two things. We've got to take the cost out of our materials and we got to accelerate our equipment side of the business on the automation. So, we want to answer both questions the second time.\nThe issue on the tariffs, the tariffs are choppy for us around the world. We did see, we had more of an impact on that. On the Food Care, the market is moving. We saw the US with the tariffs going back and forth to Canada and then to China. We saw some leveling of that out, we think over time that will take place. The tariffs hit us harder on Product Care with the Brexit, but even with some of the announcements we saw this morning, we think overtime that tariffs will play out because we do have a global footprint. In the quarter though, it did have an impact of our business, but I think going forward, I think we'll be able to balance that out.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please?\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nBrian Maguire -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nHey, good morning everyone. Just a question on the portfolio in general, obviously really strong results from Food Care to not quite offset the really weak results in Product Care there. And they strike me as two very different businesses fundamentally, I know you guys at lead Food Technology in both, but in terms of like what each business is serving and market-wise, quite a bit different. Just wondering as you're going through the process of taking a hard look at the cost structure, taking a hard look at where restructuring savings can be found, would you consider a strategic review of that Product Care business, given private transaction multiples are pretty high for plastic packaging companies and some of the good growth in the e-commerce part of it. Just wondering if you, how you would think about potential to monetize that in the given environment and maybe free up the strong Food Care trends from what's been a little bit of a weaker Product Care story in the last couple of quarters?\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. We definitely see, we are always analyzing our portfolio, first of all, so we're looking at that. We're actually analyzing it all the way down to the SKU level on the entire business. We actually do see many synergies in the Food Care and Product Care, and I'm seeing that even clearly now is we pulled Diversey off the business. If you look at the process of Food Care and Product Care, we both have materials, the materials go through equipment, loading on a process and we see the channels actually coming in together as well. Our largest customer buying a food company, we see the bio-thermal markets coming together using products to load food. So we see the markets coming together really on the Product Care side, it's really a cost issue that we got to get ahead of. And again pulling Diversey out, looking at our SG&A, looking at our product cost together as a whole, we see opportunities on the SG&A, opportunities on the product or on the cost as well as how we go to market with our innovation in our channels. So we actually see those synergies across the company.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please?\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. You may proceed.\nScott Gaffner -- Barclays -- Analyst\nThanks, good morning Ted, good morning Bill.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nScott Gaffner -- Barclays -- Analyst\nJust Ted, going back to the four buckets you outlined, SG&A, product costs, speed to market and channel optimization, can you talk about or linked quarter those bucket,s which one do you think can drive the most step change in ROIC and why do you think now is different than maybe the last four years for those buckets of cost? Thanks.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, I'll go through each one. First, looking at the SG&A, we analyzed SG&A top down looking at us compared to our peers. We've also now looking at it bottoms up, but just to highlight, the SG&A, again pulling out Diversey, if you look at our SG&A as a percent of sales before Diversey, we actually had a gain of 100 basis points on that SG&A. Definitely, we think we have an opportunity with our layers and the complexity of our business on the whole company. I think the SG&A piece we can go after pretty hard and we think that's an opportunity to go after.\nThe second piece is going after the product cost or the product efficiency or productivity. Again, looking at our business, we've done a nice job of being the price leader, but if you look at the productivity of the business, we've been raising price on higher costs. We think we have a significant opportunity to go aggressive at our cost structure and drive our productivity to higher level and actually get year-over-year productivity.\nThe third area and speed to market the innovation, we are an innovative company. So how do we measure that? Well, we measure by our vitality index and we say 10% today of our new products that we're introducing have been developed in the last five years. We need to double that. We should be an innovative company, should have 20% of its portfolio from products that were developed in the last five years. We have a significant opportunity to improve our innovation.\nAnd the last one is the channel optimization. Again the Food Care business goes highly direct, the Product Care goes through distribution. We think we have an opportunity to do a much better job in our channel optimization. A 100% dedicated distribution team can do significantly more for our profitability and where we are today. All of this is what we're building to see -- we shared with you before that 20%, 25% productivity on the leverage that we need going forward. We have to focus on these four elements to go into take that well north of that 25% year-over-year leverage, and that's what we're designing into our new model going forward.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. You may proceed.\nBrian Bergmeyer -- Citi -- Analyst\nHi, this is actually Brian Bergmeyer sitting in for Anthony. Just thinking longer term, is there any reason why Product Care can get back to its legacy margins in the 20% range. And, but would you consider to be normalized volume growth with this business now?\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nFor the first question. Absolutely. The Product Care business, we think we can get there. And as I outlined those four buckets for going after on the productivity, on the cost, we want to get there faster. On this the second, the second piece on long-term we think that we have a great business here, because the markets we serve are basically GDP. What we have to do is beat the market through our innovations and so drive a higher level of growth in GDP.\nSo going forward, we think we have a business that we should be beating marginally above GDP.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. You may proceed.\nSalvator Tiano -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst\nHi, guys. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. My question is on Latin America. You noted things went well in Mexican and Brazil. Can you give us some more color in terms of volumes for these two countries and how are things expected to shape up there over the course of 2019 even what seems to be very good performance so far in 2018.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'm sorry Can you repeat that I think you're talking about Latin America, did you ask specifically about Brazil and Mexico? I just didn't hear your question.\nSalvator Tiano -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst\nSure. Yeah, Yeah, I'm sorry. So how are volumes shaping up in Mexico and Brazil that you know that things are looking well and how should we think above these regions as we go into 2019?\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, so definitely from a from a volume perspective, very happy with our results in Latin America. Excluding acquisitions from a total company perspective, we had a 7% increase in volume. We were very happy especially in our Food Care Latin America business, because in the face of very unfavorable FX environment we were able to pass those FX increases on to customers and have a very, very strong performance there in our Latin America business.\nSo we're highly pleased with our results in Brazil relative to the strength of the Food Care business. The expansion of sales to existing customers, of new customers and we're happy with Mexico as well. We're very optimistic for that Latin America business as we go looking through the balance of 2018. We've not at this point highlighted any guidance for 2019, but our optimism relative to our Latin American business continues.\nWilliam Stiehl -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nJust one other piece on that. Latin America and our global presence has helped with the tariffs in some of the trade issues, having a strong base in Brazil and in Mexico specifically on the fresh red meat market has opened us up where we've had some tariff issues going back and forth to Asia-Pacific and the U.S. Our presence in Brazil has helped on that growth and should help us going forward.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nDaniel Rizzo -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHi, you mentioned improvement in the vitality index over I think over the next five years. I'm sorry, over the next couple of years doubling. I was just wondering what segment or sub-segment do you see the most opportunity for that?\nWilliam Stiehl -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe see it actually involved. If we look at our pipeline of innovations, some pretty exciting things are going on. And both of them are focused on the automation on the Product Care side as we are moving our -- there are customers -- are struggling with labor, cost of labor, scarcity of labor. So how can they actually load more pieces into their packages. So some of our innovations such as our flow wrap our Stealth wrap, how do we bring some automated equipment automated solutions. We're pretty excited about that.\nOn the Food Care side. We see some exciting opportunities that are actually moving this year as we move our flexible packaging into the rigid container market. I mentioned in my prepared remarks . Our Flex prep that we're going after the condiments market we're seeing great traction there. We're investing in more capacity. So we just need to pull those innovations where we can really solve some significant problems in the market quicker and faster.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nAnojja Shah -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. I just wanted to ask about M&A and how you're thinking about it right now? Are you sort of putting a pause on that while you focus on taking costs out of Product Care and on share repurchases or are you parallel processing or just generally how you're thinking about M&A?\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOn the M&A side, we're part of our capital allocation. We're looking for that to be opportunistic obviously with our share price on the buyback, the M&A that we've done so far has been accretive, looking for in the Product Care, part of the Product Care is to fix part of our portfolio where we can grow faster. So we have been looking in the integrated solutions and in the automation space so we can go faster in that area.\nAlso, we're looking at the opportunities in our Food Care business, as we can drive an accelerated rate in bringing flexible packaging to the rigid container market, looking at liquids et cetera. So we are comparing those with our capital allocation structure to be opportunistic where we can.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. You may proceed.\nRosemarie Morbelli -- Gabelli & Company -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk about the (inaudible) in North America, Australia, and then Latin America and looking at your vitality index, target of 20% that is kind of low versus a lot of companies. So, is that the first step and then you can move forward to a higher level like 30%-35% .\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. The first question on the meat market looking around the world. We definitely see the -- it was actually flat in the quarter for us. We think still for the year it's going to be positive. Looking at the market being a little less than 2% we think will actually be ahead of that, we're seeing still some fairly strong in the U.S. and Brazil. I was actually in Russia, this quarter and I got to see our largest customer in Russia doing quite well. So Australia can continue to see growth. As far as the vitality index being low going to 20%, we're at 10% today. So doubling that is quite good. Now, our business though, if we look at the Food Care and Product Care, we just need to accelerate.\nWe have a very stable business, so we don't have that same vitality index of an Apple or a software company, but we also have the great the materials to go through all that. So moving from 10% to 20% I think is a pretty aggressive target and we're putting plans in place to make that happen .\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nTyler Langton -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nGood morning. Thank you. Just had a follow-up on Product Care volumes I guess you mentioned. Thank you. Utility volumes were down 7% and I guess that's I think around 30% of the business or is that just kind of saying, sort of the rest of the business is kind of I guess flat to maybe modestly up I just kind of any details on sort of volumes are the sort of outside the utility business.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, the, if we look at -- we break it up on the utility business be down. We actually as I think I put my prepared remarks. Our specialty business is up in low single digits and actually our value-added in the automated space. We're actually up in to double-digit. So we got hit by the, what we'd call the commodity in our utility business and the shrink is we actually had a year-over-year decline. So our value-added e-commerce business is actually on a year-to-date basis of 10% and that includes our automated systems, our inflatable Bubble Wrap, Korrvu, etcetera. So we're very excited about the year-to-date performance of that business. We do see our shrink business a little bit on the decline. We saw that in Q3, we saw that in Q2, we talked to you about the nature of those particular products relative to shrink that goes around magazines, CDs, DVDs. And so some of that is just the dynamics of the purchasing marketplace there, but we're definitely focusing on our value-added solutions.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nAnd that shrink business is still roughly 10% of Product Care and is outside of that utility piece, which is 30%. Hope that clarifies that. Operator, next question please?\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. You may proceed.\nEdlain Rodriguez -- UBS Securities LLC -- Analyst\nThank you, good morning guys. Maybe I missed it, but if I did, apologies for that. Clearly, there has been a shift in strategy in Product Care. Now, you are focusing more on mix price over volume. Like what's behind that shift? Is it a question of returns not high enough, not acceptable? Just wanted to get a sense of exactly you trying to achieve in there and why that major shift in strategy?\nWilliam Stiehl -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I wouldn't say it's a shift in strategy, raising price on rising cost. That is not the strategy, we need to get the value for what we deliver. And we have to work harder on the cost out. So we really want to separate those two and that's part of the operational excellence we need to do in the Product Care. We do think we have an issue with the portfolio where the SKUs that we have very large portfolio in the product line where we need to take more significant costs out, but we also think we have margin opportunities where we have some extremely, highly differentiated products. So really want to separate that, it's not a price volume strategy, it's get the maximum value we can for highly differentiated products, but we need to do a better job in taking the costs out of that business and we need to be more aggressive to make that happen.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt is very true that you've seen a high price cost spread and mix and a lower volume for several quarters. And I think a lot of that can be explained by the strong pricing discipline that we have in both our Product Care business and our Food Care business. And because we have had such a strong discipline, we have seen some weakness on the volume side.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please?\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Gabriel Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\nGabriel Hajde -- Wells Fargo Securities LLC -- Analyst\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I was intrigued by the comment about focusing on the channel in which your Product Care, I guess, sales are sold through kind of going direct to customer as opposed to using the distribution channel that's been there for a long time. Can you talk about sort of just what's speaking to there, Ted, in terms of whether it's cost or more opportunity to deeper penetrate customers or what have you?\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I think, I was talking about both businesses just for clarity. The Product Care business is 70-30 going to our distribution channel to direct. Food Care is the opposite, even higher, going fully direct. What I was focusing on when we go through our distribution network, we think we have an opportunity to drive that and really segment that very clearly. Where we have loyal dedicated distribution base, we should be able to get a higher penetration and higher value for our products. We think putting some discipline, more discipline into how we serve our distribution channel, we think we can add value and actually get better margin and provide better service for our customers. The direct side of the business, on the Product Care, that's where the solutions come through. As we're working with our customers, we're talking to different people that are driving the automation. If we are talking to the top level of the business where they want to transform their operations, reduce their labor costs, when they're looking for an automated solution, that's a capital-intensive decision, and that's the part that we need to get -- do a better job of to drive our automated solutions and Product Care. But the same thing works in Food Care where we're selling our highly automated solutions to the B2B and to the end user. It's focusing on the capital-intensive decision to put in one of our systems, but then still maintaining the account where the materials are coming through. So it's for both businesses, but for working on our discipline on the distribution is more of a product care situation.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, next question please?\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nArun Viswanathan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGood morning. Thanks. Yes, you guys I guess have had some headwinds in the form of input costs and FX and freight as well. I guess I just wanted to understand, in the utility area as well, why your competitors may not necessarily be seeing as much pressure in those areas, or if they are, what gives them a little bit more ability to be more competitive on price and if you see any changes there over the next year or two, or do you think that's still going to be a challenge for you? Thanks.\nWilliam Stiehl -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI think it's more than saying that it's the competitors, it's really focusing on the markets. If we look at our shrink film, which is the one that we've talked about, if you pull that in utility business, the primary markets for shrink film have been markets that have actually been contracting. Selling shrink film to the DVD, CD, magazine, wrapping markets have been declining.\nSo it's not necessarily losing it to the competition. We got to direct that to a growing market. For instance, anybody who has a box, we can wrap it and use our shrink film to do that significantly at a lower cost. Also, the shrink film is what goes into our flow wrap. As we drive our automated solution, we need to go faster with our automated packaging that actually pull through that shrink film. So it's not necessarily that we're losing it to competition. We've got to be pointing at the growing markets for those products.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd on the FX, I mean we have definitely seen some headwinds there. When we rolled out our guidance for the full year of '18 from a total company basis, we saw that we were going to have tailwinds in FX at the adjusted EBITDA level of $20 million. Now, it's headwinds of $10 million. So that's basically a $30 million swing from a total company perspective that we've seen on FX alone. We've basically seen the market applying some increases in resin prices as well, and one significant cost for us has been our freight costs. And even though we did go out with a price increase in April of 2018 in our Product Care business, freight costs have continued to increase for both Food Care and Product Care and we've had a much more pronounced impact as far the increase on freight costs within our Product Care business than we have in our Food Care.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nOperator, please move to next question please.\nOperator\nAnd we have a follow-up question from George Staphos of Bank America-Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.\nLori Chaitman -- Vice president, Investor Relations\nMolly, George? Operator, I think we have one more question in queue.\nOperator\nAnd we have another follow-up question from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. You may proceed.\nScott Gaffner -- Barclays -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my follow-up. Just two quick things. One, Ted, if I look back at 2011, new product vitality for the company was something closer to 17%. You're saying today, it's now 10%. So can you sort of bridge what's happened? I know you weren't there the whole time, but what led us to 17% -- from 17% down to 10%? And then within Product Care, it seems like there has been significant consolidation on that commodity utility side of the business. How has the overall competitive landscape really changed within Product Care? Thanks.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. So we probably need to go offline on the -- when I went back to 2010, I took it out of Diversey. So we got to be careful what's in there for Diversey and what's in there for the rest of the company. The 2010 is where I was taking some of the analytics for, but the current state of where we are right or wrong is in that 10% what we have for the vitality index. So I can't comment to what was in the previous years you had. This is what we're dealing with right now and what we got to go fix. And the second part of your question, Scott?\nScott Gaffner -- Barclay -- Analyst\nSure, it is really on Product Care and the level of consolidation that we've seen away from Sealed Air. I think there's been a lot of consolidation and some of the more commodity utility players within the industry that significantly change the competitive landscape and then Product Care.\nTed Doheny -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think so. Yes. And that's again why we got to get our cost right. So we can compete, if we can't get the differentiated value for our products. We got to take the cost out to go get that in that part of the space, but also we need to work with. We have a pretty strong channel with our distributors, we need to work to make sure the find out what we need to do to get that business. If it is a cost base business, we're going to take our cost and be competitive there, but also I truly believe it's part of that automation side that we have some opportunities to fix.\nScott Gaffner -- Barclay -- Analyst\nThanks, Ted.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentleman.
