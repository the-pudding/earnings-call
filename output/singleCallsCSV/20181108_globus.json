My name is Nicole, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Globus Medical Quarterly Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Brian Kearns. The floor is yours, sir.\nBrian Kearns -- Vice President, Business Development & Investor Relations\nThank you, Nicole, and thank you everyone for being with us today. Joining today's call from Globus Medical will be Dave Demski, CEO; Dan Scavilla, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and CFO; Anthony Williams, President; and David Paul, Executive Chairman. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Globus Medical website at www.globusmedical.com.\nBefore we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-Q for the 2018 third quarter and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission identify certain factors that could cause our actual to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. Our SEC filings, including the 10-Q, are available on our website. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.\nOur discussion today will also include certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information pertinent to our business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for, and should be read together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Globus Medical website.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave Demski, our CEO.\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the third quarter was $169 million, an increase of 11.5% over Q3 2017, and our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.39 per share, an increase of 29% over last year. Year-to-date, revenue stand at $517 million and non-GAAP EPS at $1.24 per share, up 12% and 33% respectively.\nOur US Spine business accelerated significantly in the quarter, growing by 7.5% over last year, the highest growth we have achieved since 2015, reflecting both implant pull through from ExcelsiusGPS placements and strong recruiting, which is on pace for back to back record years. These two factors combined with a robust product release schedule for the first half of next year, point to continued strong growth through 2019.\nOur International Spine business grew by 6.9% in Q3 or 8.6% on a constant currency basis. The Japan business grew significantly in Q3 as we began increasing the flow of Globus technology into the country.\nWe have seen impressive growth in several key markets this year including Australia, Germany and Italy, while the UK continues to lag. We are encouraged by the future prospects in that market as we are taking steps to address operational issues and the NHS elective surgery backlog has begun to turn around.\nOur spinal implant launches in the first half of this year slowed from historical norms as much of the company's energy and resources were focused on growing the Excelsius platform, getting the trauma business off the ground, and producing products to fully integrate the distribution channel acquired from Alphatec. That began to change in the third quarter as we saw solid sales contributions from COALITION MIS titanium and the launch of the CREO side loading system.\nCOALITION MIS titanium is an integrated cervical interbody fusion device that combines SintrOS surface treatment technology with an advanced anchoring mechanism and a streamlined insertion technique. SintrOS is a proprietary surface treatment that provides a bone-friendly interface between the implant and the retrieval body.\nCREO side loading is the latest addition to our comprehensive CREO stabilization system. The CREO side loading technology is ideal for segmental correction techniques and is easier to use than competing systems in the treatment of severe spinal deformities and complex patient anatomies.\nEmerging Technology revenue for the third quarter was $6.3 million, driven primarily by our sales of ExcelsiusGPS system including our first ever international system placement in Greece. The third quarter is traditionally a slow quarter for capital sales, and this year it may have been somewhat exacerbated by the timing of NASS. Several competitors have targeted the event to unveil their future product plans.\nFeedback from the meeting indicated that these offerings were not particularly compelling. This was confirmed by our strong booth traffic and a noticable uptick in our business post NASS, as we close more deals in the October in the US than in the entire third quarter. Consequently, we are raising revenue and EPS guidance for the third consecutive quarter.\nGiven the potential of this transformative technology, we expect all major spinal implant manufacturers to launch robotic systems in the coming years. We continue to be highly encouraged by our early lead in the technology as we are winning the battle in a vast majority of head to head evaluations. Our pipeline of potential deals is robust, and we are seeing growing interest among spine surgeons. More importantly, we are seeing ExcelsiusGPS adopted enthusiastically with great clinical results and customer feedback.\nAs we alluded to in prior calls, the early success of ExcelsiusGPS has led us to make a number of investments in this strategically important area. To that end, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Surgimap, the leading surgical planning software for spine. Surgimap's intuitive patient specific surgical planning and cloud-based infrastructure with predictive algorithms and visual guide enable surgeons to plan and simulate potential surgical outcomes in the course of treating complex deformities. The addition of Surgimap will further strengthen the ExcelsiusGPS platform by streamlining workflow and enabling superior data analytics. These existing platform features, in addition to the deep software expertise of the Surgimap team, are also expected to accelerate the launch of new products in Imaging, Navigation, and Robotics.\nWe made steady progress in our trauma business during the quarter, with our focus continuing to be the production of inventory to support the national rollout of our core systems. As discussed last quarter, the magnitude of the logistical effort to launch the number of systems and SKUs we have targeted has proven to be a short-term challenge, taxing our manufacturing and supply chain, and resulting in some delays to our full on schedule. We have expanded internal and external capacity and expect to achieve full launches of all core systems by the end of the year.\nOur product lines has been well received by the surgeon community. There was palpable enthusiasm and interest from many surgeons at the recent Orthopaedic Trauma Association meeting in Orlando. We have recruited some of the top talent in the industry to our sales team and we expect to see a growing contribution to both the top and bottom lines in 2019 from the trauma business.\nIn summary, as we head into the last quarter of 2018, we are on track to produce more organic revenue growth and more earnings growth in any year since we've been a public company. The investments we have made across our business lines, INR, trauma, spine and international distribution are all poised to deliver exceptional growth in 2019 and beyond. Finally, we have achieved this while maintaining industry-leading operating margins, profitability and cash flow.\nI will now turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel Scavilla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer & Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased by the strong financials in Q3 with continued above market gains in the US business, improving growth in the international markets and the entry of the ExcelsiusGPS robot into the international market.\nQ3 sales were $169.2 million, growing 11.5% as reported or 11.8% in constant currency, with the same selling days in the quarter as prior year. GAAP net income was $35.2 million and non-GAAP net income was $39.4 million, delivering $0.39 fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA of 34.1% and $36.4 million of free cash flow.\nFocusing on sales, US sales for the quarter were $139.1 million, 10.5% higher than Q3 2017. The growth was derived from strong performance in implant sales driven by competitive rep onboarding, increased implant pull through from accounts with our robot, and continued placements of the ExcelsiusGPS system. International sales for the quarter were $30.1 million, growing 16% as reported or 18.5% in constant currency, delivering continued sequential growth acceleration for the year. Gains are achieved through ExcelsiusGPS sales coupled with continued market penetration in Japan and other key markets.\nTurning to the rest of the P&L, Q3 gross profit was 77.6% compared to 75.7% in Q3 2017. The gain is primarily due to the change in depreciable lives for cases and instruments implemented in Q4 2017. Full year gross profit is projected to remain in the mid-70%s reflecting full year effective pricing pressure, biologic mix and increased investments in cases and instruments.\nResearch and development expenses for the third quarter were $15.5 million or 9.2% of sales compared to $10.9 million or 7.2% in Q3 2017, resulting from increased investments in robotic and spine. Included in this quarter, a $2.5 million of one-time expenses, primarily related to technology and licensing fees.\nSG&A expenses for the third quarter were $75.1 million or 44.4% compared to $63.4 million or 41.8% in Q3 2017 reflecting our planned reinvestment of the US tax reform savings to drive future growth. Expanding the US spine sales force building out the robotic and trauma commercial teams, growing the Japanese sales force and increasing surgeon education are the primary investment areas.\nThe GAAP net income tax rate for Q3 was 17.3% compared to 31.5% in Q3 2017, driven by the US tax reform and higher deductions for stock compensation due to increased option exercises in the quarter. The stock option favorable impact was 3.3% reduction in our base tax rate for the quarter. We project an effective full year tax rate for 2018 of approximately 17%.\nGAAP third quarter net income was $35.2 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.35. Non-GAAP net income was $39.4 million, growing 34.5% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.39 growing 29.2%, including continued investments in Emerging Technologies that impacted Q3 2018 EPS by $0.07 compared to $0.05 in Q3 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Q3 2018 was 34.1%, which includes 1.9 percentage point drag from the increased investments in Emerging Technologies. The company continues to deliver best-in-class margins while investing for the future, as we focus on investing for growth while maintaining our profitability. Our full year 2018 EBITDA margin is projected to be in the mid-30s.\nWe ended the quarter with $541.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Net cash provided by operating activities in Q3 was $51.8 million and free cash flow was $36.4 million. The company remains debt free. The company is increasing guidance for full year 2018 sales by $5 million to $705 million and increasing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.07 to $1.62, reflecting our ability to deliver strong margins and financial results, while continuing to invest in sustained growth for the long-term health of the business.\nIn closing, I want to provide you with an update on our CFO search. There is a great (inaudible) opportunity, and we continue to interact with numerous potential candidates. Given the significance of the role and helping shape the next chapters of Globus' growth, we're taking time and being selective in the screening process. We're pleased with the candidates we've interacted with to date, and we feel we should be finished the search by year's end.\nWe will now open the call for questions.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nGlobus Medical Inc (GMED) Q1 2019 Earnings Call Transcript\n\n\nGlobus Medical Inc (GMED) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript\n\n\nWhy Globus Medical Is Soaring Today\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.\nJaime Morgan -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\nHey, guys. This is Jaime on for Rich. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a nice quarter.\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Jaime.\nJaime Morgan -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\nFirst question I have, I guess, is on the international business, performed very well this quarter. So, if there's any sort of color you can share around the strength that you saw in the quarter? And kind of what's the new run rate there that we should be expecting for the full year and potentially heading into 2019? Or ask another way, was some of the things you saw more one-time in nature? I know you said that you placed your first robot there kind of make a stand up on that a little bit if you can? Thanks.\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Jaime. So, yes, we're certainly pleased with the results for international. As you know, we have been investing and structuring that for some time. This year in particular was a focus investment year. And when you look at this, again, you see a lift that is driven somewhat by the Excelsius placement as Dave said in Greece.\nBut more importantly, you look at the continued growth and expansion and penetration within Japan and several other markets as well that we see just sequential growth and lift. We still feel that we're under index there, I think market share, we're going to remain investing in driving international growth. I would tell you that exiting this year at the high-single low-double digit is the goal, and then looking to accelerate that throughout 2019 until we start taking sizable share is really our intent.\nJaime Morgan -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks. That's helpful. And then I guess just on the guidance, you guys obviously raised it by $5 million. Is it fair to assume that most of that rate is coming from the robot or kind of what are the puts and takes to the $5 million increase? Thanks.\nDaniel Scavilla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer & Chief Financial Officer\nI think it's across the board, so we don't tend to break out the actual moves within this, but we're pleased with that US strength as we just said. We feel very bullish about the robots against the going there. So I would tell you without really pointing to one area, we just have a good feeling and some confidence that we can go beyond our existing guidance, and that's really why we raised it in general.\nJaime Morgan -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question.\nOperator\nNext question comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nGreat. Can you hear me alright?\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes.\nDaniel Scavilla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer & Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Kyle.\nKyle Rose -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nGreat. Congrats on a strong quarter. Just wanted to see, you talked about the sources of US strength in the quarter. I wondered if maybe you could give us just a little more color there, maybe frame how much of the strength you saw was from some of the sales conversions, and then the rest particularly on the implant pull-through on Excelsius? I mean, it's great to see that come in. I think some of the previous calls you talked like maybe it would take a little bit longer, you need more robots to really see that top line growth, but may be what are you seeing in the Q3 that gives you more confidence that that you're starting to see that pull through?\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Kyle. I think in terms of recruiting, as I alluded to, in the comments, last year was a record recruiting year. We look like we're going to match that this year. We're doing a great job of on-boarding the new reps and seeing some conversions earlier in the process with some of the recruits this year. In terms of the robot, I mean, as the installed base expands, I think that you'll see a growing impact to our overall implant strength. So while we've been selling a lot of robots, it's really building up the number that are in the field that's going to drive the implant pull through.\nKyle Rose -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nAnd then on the OUS, Japan, great to see that as a source of strength. Maybe just kind of remind us on where you are as far as you know getting products approved, Globus legacy products approved in Japan? And then I'll hop off. Thanks for taking the questions.\nAnthony Williams -- President\nHey, Kyle, this is Anthony. We have continued -- a pretty quick cases are getting Globus products approved there. We have maybe 10 or 11 of our systems approved in Japan and are pretty actively converting surgeons off of the Alphatec product and on to ours. 2019 is going to be a big year for that as we get some of our additional advanced technologies into the country.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien.\nWilliam Inglis -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nHi guys, this is Will on for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess starting off with US Spine, the growth was a little bit stronger than we were expecting. Just wondering if you could tease apart maybe any impact from the hurricanes? And if there is any benefits from reps that came off non-competes from last year?\nDaniel Scavilla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer & Chief Financial Officer\nThanks for the question. So, I would tell you we saw minimal, if any, Will, negative impact for the hurricane. We thought that that had some delays, but it was covered within the quarter. So, not enough for us to call out any sizable number or look at that. We're more importantly for you to think of a roll through into Q4 related to that. I would say that's just not really material enough to consider. But what Dave was saying and what I was calling out as well as when we talk about the recruiting that is reps who were coming off, who are being active and who are driving sales. And so the lift that we're seeing in the US is primarily related to the strong recruiting that has occurred over 2017 and into early 2018, it's now bearing fruit.\nWilliam Inglis -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nGreat, thanks. And then as far as the robotic competitive landscape, have you seen anything, any changes, regarding your competitors robotic acquisition? And then any changes with the sales cycle? It sounds like NASS was quite successful. But any updates there would be helpful? Thanks.\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nNot in particularly, Will, the integration of the navigation of the robotics from our main competitor. They've been showing at -- they actually showed at NASS last year. So it's not really news to the market. So anybody who is going to make that decision, I think is probably -- made that decision as they were going to go in another direction. So, there has been a lot of noise around what people are going to do, but I think what's really out there right now, I think we are clearly seen as the leader, when we go head to head in evaluations, we are winning the vast majority of time.\nWilliam Inglis -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jonathan Demchick with Morgan Stanley.\nJonathan Demchick -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHello. Thanks for taking the questions. One of -- I guess follow up a bit on that robotics question. Obviously, the Emerging Tech contribution seems a little later, and you explained it pretty well with NASS. But I was curious if it was I guess related to potentially capacity to close the deals just that there was a lot going on with NASS coming up, or was it more I guess competitive positioning? And then what's kind of the update that you gave on the fourth quarter? I was curious if you had any thoughts on what's a reasonable expectation on the seasonably probably stronger fourth quarter relative to -- obviously will be a seasonally weaker 3Q in the robotics field?\nDaniel Scavilla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer & Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Jon, thanks for the question.\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nI'm sorry, Jon. We're going to both answer your question. I was going to address your first question, your first comment about NASS. I didn't mean to -- I hope I didn't speak, I think it's more of a third quarter phenomenon that it was NASS. We think NASS may have had a little extra effect this year because of a lot of noise from the competition about what they were going to come out with. But traditionally, the third quarter is light in terms of capital and we saw that as well. I think we counter to that as the fourth quarter was strong, which we started out strong, and every indication is this will be a good quarter for us. And Dan, do you want to --\nDaniel Scavilla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer & Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, build on that to Jon. So, same thing, as you know, we've said through the year, we need to go through a cycle, make sure we understand that we recognize capital have seasonality. Coming into Q3 this way, it looks like it followed the seasonal trend. You know you had asked a question about Q4, and we've always said, Q4 is a heavier capital year. My estimate, and some of our experience before with other capital products is somewhere around 30% of sales occurred in the Q4. I don't know why we would be off track from that. Again, we still need to run through that lab. But it would be consistent with really what we've been saying all year.\nJonathan Demchick -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nDan, it makes sense. Just two quick follow-ups. So the first on just the US business as a whole. Obviously, there was a pretty big uptick in sales. It sounded like a lot of that was on pull through. Anything particularly on the spine market as a whole? And then I'll just ask my second follow-up now, which is on gross margin guidance looked like the guidance implied a pretty substantial step down into the fourth quarter. Was just wondering if there was anything particular going on there?\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. And so I'll take the first part of that on the US market, Jon. As a smaller player, it's hard for us to really see the entire market. I think, if you look at the factors that we traditionally look at in terms of procedures and pricing, those really haven't changed materially. We are already starting to see kind of that seasonality that we've seen in recent years, where there's a lot of the high deductible payments occurring. So we're starting to see a spike in our business. But other than that, I think it's a solid market, it's not spectacular, but it's not -- it's not shrinking in any way either.\nDaniel Scavilla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer & Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Jon, on the second part of your question, I don't feel like we're coming off track from anything previously communicated. So you're sitting a year-to-date at 70% to 75% margin. We said that as we get into Q4 and especially activate sets not only for the increased spine growth but for trauma, you're going to have a rise in depreciation. And so you kind of look at a slight step down that was anticipated, given the fact that you're going to become active and start depreciating instruments and sets. So I'm not concerned about it fits right into the plan from what we've said every other quarter.\nJonathan Demchick -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThank you. Very helpful.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nSam Brodovsky -- BTIG -- Analyst\nHi. This is Sam on for Ryan. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to quickly touch on the adjusted EBITDA margin, it's been bit of a trend down for a few quarters here, and you said Emerging Tech is being a bit of a drag there. When are you thinking about that turning around and where do you think that could be going over the longer term? Thank you.\nDaniel Scavilla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer & Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I think we'll always say we're a mid-30s EBITDA company. This fall is within the mid-30s range and have declared to folks between 33% and 37%. The reason is trending down follows historical norms, but more importantly, it's really driven by the fact that we tend to ramp up our trauma investments. So think about us carrying the commercial side of trauma pre-revenue. And so as we add more folks to that bench getting ready to launch, we're going to see a slight step down. As that revenue comes in, that will neutralize over some period of time.\nSo, I would tell you again no concerns. It's right about where we think it ought to be in the mid-30s range. It makes sense for us because we said that we would spend and redeploy. Especially with the US tax savings, we decide to really drive some of that in for this year and take advantage of that. And this fits in where we want to be.\nSam Brodovsky -- BTIG -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham & Company.\nDavid Saxon -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nHi, good afternoon. This is David on for Mike. Just one on robotics. Just wondering if you can integrate some sort of nerve monitoring capability into the robot? And then also can you just talk about the timing of new indications for Excelsius?\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Thanks, David. Currently the technology does not integrate nerve monitoring into it. And then in terms of the new indications that we're expecting that's going to be early next year before we will have, we expect clearance on that.\nDavid Saxon -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And then for the trauma sales force, are you planning on additional hiring in the fourth quarter? And then maybe when you're planning on the full launch? Any color on what portion of the sales force will have rolled off their non-competes?\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nHiring in the fourth quarter is not going to be substantial. We still have a few candidates in the pipeline that we're going to pull, and we're going to take a pause on hiring as we launch all the systems. And then I do anticipate later next year to go through another hiring phase as we get some traction in the sales cycle.\nAnd to the second half of your question, in terms of non-competes, I haven't really looked at exactly, but I would say, on average, we're probably halfway through their non-compete cycle. But as we hire competitive reps in both spine and trauma, we are -- we expect the remainder of our sales force to really address the market that they have left, and left a vacuum in there, so that we are in there, trying to get business even before they come off their non-compete.\nDavid Saxon -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nGreat. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Larry Biegleson with Wells Fargo.\nShagun Singh -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nHey, guys. This is Shagun in for Larry. Can you hear me OK?\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nWe can.\nShagun Singh -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nGreat. So, it looks like adjusted for one extra selling day. Your guidance implies about 5% growth in the fourth quarter versus 12% year-to-date. And I do understand that there are some tough comps, but Q4 is also a heavy capital placement quarter. You've previously indicated that 40% of the year's placements are in Q4. And I believe you did make some comments about closing more deals in October than the entire Q3. So why the deceleration and how should we think about 2019? Are you comfortable with where consensus is currently, looking for sales and EPS growth of 9% and 10% respectively?\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo, couple of things with this. We give guidance for the full year. We don't look quarter by quarter. You're doing the math, and I respect that. What we're doing is putting a number out that we feel we can achieve, and based on several different variables we will be anniversarying our robotic launch from last year in the quarter and that itself will have a natural effect as you crossover all the previous quarters, this year you not have that, so we factor that in.\nAnd again with the marketing change, we just want to make sure that we've got the ability to achieve this number. So that's probably the first answer. For 2019, we're not in a position to offer guidance. We tend to do that in the beginning of January, so we could have that conversation once we get out there and release those numbers.\nShagun Singh -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nOkay, that's helpful. And then I was just wondering if you expect to see disruption from competitors like Stryker, K2 and NuVasive, and how much you think you can benefit especially in 2019 and perhaps you've already started seeing some of the benefit. If you can comment on that, that will be great? Thank you.\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I would tell you again with the 7 or 8 share in the US, we're still share takers, and regardless of the activity out there, we're going to look to drive and penetrate by doing competitive recruits and capturing that, if we look at acquisitions that may be disruptive for them. We will look and see where that makes sense and take advantage of it. But other than that, you know, we are monitoring this and we still go out with the fact that we've got a lot of ground to go through penetration and that's how we'll look to grow.\nShagun Singh -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nGreat, thanks.\nOperator\nAnd at this time, we're showing no further questions. We thank everyone for their participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.\nDuration: 29 minutes\nCall participants:\nBrian Kearns -- Vice President, Business Development & Investor Relations\nDavid Demski -- Chief Executive Officer\nDaniel Scavilla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer & Chief Financial Officer\nJaime Morgan -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\nKyle Rose -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nAnthony Williams -- President\nWilliam Inglis -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nJonathan Demchick -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nSam Brodovsky -- BTIG -- Analyst\nDavid Saxon -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nShagun Singh -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nMore GMED analysis\nTranscript powered by AlphaStreet\nThis article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.
