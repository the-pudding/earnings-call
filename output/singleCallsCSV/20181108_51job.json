This conference call is being recorded and broadcasted on the Internet and a replay will be available through our website at ir.51job.com.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Yan -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Linda and welcome to today's call. I will begin with a review of the third quarter, followed by Kathleen with a detail discussion of our financial results and our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018. Finally, we'll open the call to your questions. We are pleased to report solid financial results as we continue to deploy our high quality growth strategy with diligence and success.\nTotal revenues exceeded our forecast and grew 31% to RMB955 million and we achieved high profitability with non-GAAP EPS of RMB5.09. Our online business maintain a strong trend, as revenues increased 33% in the third quarter. In-line with our expectations, the growth came from significant ARPU improvement of 39% which was partially offset by a decline in online employers in the quarter.\nAn important strategic part in 2018 has been to reevaluate and optimize the allocation of sales resources to increase productivity. While this initiative has required us to impose a stricter criteria with regards to the employers we direct our surfaces too, it has also enabled us to meaningfully further deepen relations with employers, drive up selling and deliver greater value to our customers. These efforts again elevated online ARPU, which increased by nearly 39% to another record quarterly level.\nAs we have been focused on reconfiguring account less amount of our sales people to yield higher returns, we have purposely limited new customer additions in 2018. And have also chosen to reduce or eliminate coverage of certain employers. Closing the year, we believe that ARPU will continue to be the primary growth driver and there will be more adjustments to the customer count.\nWe remain confident that as we built long-term, high quality HR connections, with an audience of more professional and established enterprise customers, we can better identify emerging needs, improved product adoption and realize better monetization of the entire employer base in the future. In the other HR services segment, revenues grew 27% in the third quarter on the back of robust customer demand and usage of our BPO, training, assessment and placement services.\nAs the need and competition for good talent has intensified in China, employers are expanding their HR strategies, beyond just identifying and recruiting talent, but increasingly more about how to retain, promote and nurture such talent. This year we have increased investments and product development in the fields of individual job seeker training, advanced assessment methods and new BPO service modules such as attendance tracking. Through our strengthened sales team that is more a depth than ever at up-selling and cross-selling to employers, we look forward to commercializing more product and services in the other HR services area over time.\nTurning now to our -- to our per market assessment as most employers have communicated that they are committed to completing their HR budgets as originally planned early in the year, we have reflected a solid close to 2018 in RF and in your forecast for the fourth quarter. While we expect recruitment demand for white-collar workers will wrap up on a positive note, they have seen obviously -- there has obviously been a lot of discussion and speculation recently about the outlook of the Chinese economy. Needless to say, increased uncertainty in the needs among enterprises can affect their hiring activity.\nAlthough, our current conversations with employers do not indicate mark pessimism, many decided about their plans for 2019 at this time. Also as December and January are seasonally soft periods for January (inaudible) we will be patient as we may not likely have a true gauge of demand until after Chinese New Year 2019.\nIn 20 years, 51job has experienced many business cycles and capital market swings. We are fully prepared and we work with whatever hand we had doubt rather than using our energies hypothesizing above matters not within our scope of influence. We are 100% convinced off and continue to tackle the challenges that are fundamental to human capital management regardless of economic or external factors.\nProblems on how the fine workers keep them motivated and elevate their capabilities are above for employers as they grow and adapt in China's rapid -- rapidly changing and dynamic market. We stay focused on product development for the long-term and not to assist our customers in cultivating a talented generation of future worker under the mantra of innovated in China.\nUndistracted, undeterred and armed with a broad portfolio of products and services, robust business fundamentals a strong balance sheet and a long-proven track record of healthy profitable operations, 51job remains highly confident in our market position and extremely excited about HR opportunity in China.\nI will now pass the call over to Kathleen.\nKathleen Chien -- Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nThank you, Rick. In my following presentation, please be aware that all financial numbers are in our reporting currency of the Chinese Renminbi unless otherwise stated. Also please note that all growth rates are on a year-over-year basis, as compared with the corresponding period in 2017 unless otherwise indicated.\nOur result for 2018 include the consolidation of Lagou to our financial statement. But as Lagou's contribution to 51jobs overall results was not significant, we will not be discussing or providing separate details for Lagou. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB955 million representing a 31% increase. Our online revenues for the third quarter grew more than 33% to RMB649 million, which was due to a significant increase in the average revenue per employer, but a modest decrease in unique employers. Through primarily upselling, as well as some higher prices for certain online product, instituted earlier this yea, our overall online ARPU rose 39% in the third quarter.\nIn line with our current initiative to prioritize higher potential employers and recalibrate our customer base, we were selected in acquiring new corporate customers and terminated coverage of certain accounts. This resulted in a 4% reduction in the estimated number of unique employers to 365,000 companies, compared with 381,000 in the year ago period.\nFor the full-year 2018, while we do expect to see a modest decrease in the employer count compared to the previous year, we are on track to realize our key strategic goals of significantly raising ARPU, improving sales productivity and strengthening the calibre of our employer interactions.\nRevenues for other HR services increased 27% to RMB305 million in the third quarter, which was driven by greater customer demand and usage of BPO, training, assessment and placement services. The pace of growth has remained healthy, the lesson from the first half levels due to easier comps in early 2017. Our sales teams continue to deliver and make solid progress in their cross promotion effort and to include these value-added services in their discussions and proposals with sophisticated employers.\nAs has been the case for the past several years, we expect a busy campus recruitment season to bring important contribution to our other HR services in the fourth quarter. Gross profit grew 31% to RMB685 million and gross margin was 72.5%, slightly lower than last year's level due to increased employer compensation expenses and some additional costs related to the roll out of new services. Included in cost of services in the third quarter was higher share-based compensation expense of RMB4.7 million.\nSales and marketing expenses increased 32% to RMB323 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation expenses, headcount additions, as well as greater advertising expenditures and more branding activities surrounding 51jobs 20th anniversary. Included in sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter was higher share-based compensation expense of RMB4 million.\nWhile we will continue to invest in the salesforce and to support and promote the expanding portfolio of brands, platforms and services under the 51job umbrella, we will also stay equally active and disciplined in monitoring the return of these investments.\nOur G&A expenses increased 16% to RMB91 million in the third quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher employee compensation, rent and office expenses. Share-based compensation expense included in G&A was RMB20.5 million in the third quarter. Income from operations increased 35% to RMB271 million in the third quarter and operating margin was 28.7% compared with 27.9% in the year ago quarter. Excluding share-based compensation expense, operating margin would have been 31.7%, compared with 31.1% in the year ago quarter.\nIn the third quarter, under mark-to-market accounting, we recognized a large non-cash gain of RMB549 million associated with the change in the fair value of the convertible notes. The decrease of the trading price of our ADSs on the NASDAQ resulted in a corresponding decline in the value of the convertible notes during the period. As the notes are our liability on the company's balance sheet, the decrease in the fair value was recorded as a gain on our P&L, although it has no impact on the company's cash flow or cash position.\nIn the third quarter due to the material change in the value of the RMB against the US dollar and the resulting foreign currency impact on our US dollar cash deposits and US dollar denominated convertible notes, we've recognized a non-cash foreign exchange loss of RMB67 million. During the third quarter, we also recognized a gain of -- on the sale of long-term investments in the amount of RMB61 million. We modestly reduced our holding in Shanghai Golden Education and Training Company or Golden finance, which is the provider of online and offline finance and accounting training programs. However, we are obviously still an avid supporter and continue to have many collaborations with Golden Finance.\nDue to the significant impact of the change in the fair value of the convertible notes, we recorded net income attributable to 51job of RMB785 million in the third quarter. Fully diluted earnings per share was RMB5.16 or USD0.75 per share. Excluding share-based compensation expense, the loss from foreign currency translation, the change in the fair value of the convertible note, as well as the tax effect related to these items. Our non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to 51job increased 59% to RMB333 million in the third quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted EPS was RMB5.09 or USD0.74 per share.\nTurning now to our guidance and based on current market conditions, our total revenues target for the fourth quarter of 2018 is in the estimated range of RMB1.09 billion to RMB1.12 billion. For the non-GAAP fully diluted EPS target, our estimated range is between RMB4.45 and RMB4.75 per share under the if-converted method. Please note that this non-GAAP EPS target range does not include share-based compensation expense, the impact of foreign currency translation. Any change in the fair value of the convertible notes nor the related tax effect of these items.\nOur total share-based compensation expense is expected to be between RMB30 million and RMB31 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Guidance for earnings per share is provided on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the future impact of certain items, such as the gains and losses from currency translation and the change in the fair value of the convertible notes.\nWe are not able to provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP items to expected reported GAAP earnings per share without unreasonable efforts, due to the unknown effect and potential significance of such future impact and changes. This guidance reflects our current forecast, which is subject to change.\nThis concludes our presentation. We will be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator, please go ahead.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Wendy Huang with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nFrank Chen -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nHi, management. This is Frank Chan with Macquarie on behalf of Wendy Huang. Congratulation on the very strong set of results and very solid guidance. This year the company did quite a impressive job of increasing ARPU by upselling and price hike. And how should we think of the ARPU trend into next year, are we still going to have -- increase our ARPU by 20% to 30% year-over-year into next year? And on the other hand way, our customer base is -- we lost 4% year-over-year in terms of customer base. Can you just share us more about what kind of customer leave us or what kind of customer which use to serve them less, are you including wage industry are they onto the size of those customers. And looking ahead, how should we think of the customer trend into 4Q 2019?\nAnd my last question is about macro, do we see any of our customer are cutting their HR budget this year. And into next year if they are cutting their budget significantly or freezing their hiring process due to the macro uncertainty, how should we cope with this situation. Thank you management for taking my question again, thank you.\nKathleen Chien -- Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nThank you, Frank. I will try to address the three questions I guess in the order that you raise them. First question relates to ARPU and trend, I mean I think what we expect and what you have seen already this year is that ARPU is going to be the primary driver of the cost -- of our revenue growth at this point in time. And we do expect to see this trend going forward in 2019 as well. So that is a reflection of the strategic focus that we've had in terms of trying to do a much better job in terms of cross-selling and up-selling the product and services in our portfolio and that is something that we do expect to continue in 2019.\nThe second question relates to then the customer coverage and maybe the customer account trend, and yes you did notice and we've actually spoken to this as well is we are actually we're calibrating the type of accounts and the number of accounts that each of our customer, our sales rep can serve effectively and productively if you will. And we actually, purposely terminated coverage on smaller accounts, where we felt that there was very limited potential. And so because we define them as if you will, limited potential, they're actually going to be very small customers, who have spent very little in terms of dollars with us, which is actually in effect a way for us to also be able to manage up ARPU then of the total average once we actually stop coverage of some of these small accounts as well.\nSo I think that we do expect that there will be some trimming of the customer base in the fourth quarter, as well as we continue on this trend of making some recalibration, but I think this is something that just a transitional period that we must go through and that we expect that that will probably still continue for a couple of more quarters, as we move ahead.\nAnd then the last question on macro in general, I think it's too early for us to make any commentary on 2019, because I think that most companies don't have actually budget fixed for 2019 at this time. I think that we expect that you know 2018 has been a year that I think people have been very active in the marketplace and that we will have a solid close to the year as we expect. But I think we will have to wait for the actual 2018 post CNY period to come around before we can actually say what our people's real plans are. I mean, obviously we're having discussions with employers at this time, but I don't believe that discussions now is going to be necessary something that we could for sure count on for post CNY 2019.\nBut I think regardless of what happens in terms of the demand levels, now we see from employers, I think what we have been doing and what we've gone through in the past as well is that we continue to be very, very focused on just trying to maximize our share wallet within customer accounts. And if someone decides to spend more or less, it is not something that we can control, but we believe that we have the biggest portfolio of product and services and that we have been there through stick and stand with our customers and that we believe that we should be able to weather any of these so-called fluctuations in the environment going forward. So that I hope answers your three questions.\nFrank Chen -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nYeah, that's very helpful. Thank you, Kathleen.\nKathleen Chien -- Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Alicia Yap with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAlicia Yap -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nHi, good morning, Rick, Kathleen and Linda, thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions, sorry to ask the macro questions again. Understand, we wouldn't have visibility at this point in terms of how much the hiring sentiment or the overall broader market could look like into next year, but given Jobs have been true, a feel of the down cycle right including the global financial crisis in 2008 and worries and all these like China slowdown back in 2013, but just wondering compared to the past fuel cycle have you seen anything difference that you would caught out this time either it is more positively or more negatively in terms of what's the message from the conversation that you had with some of the employer. And then in terms of what 51job would be able to do differently this time versus the past couple of times in the downturn, if you could share some of that will be great. And then just second on -- follow-up on the sales and marketing initiative, could you share with us in terms of the sales force coverage per account like how many accounts the typical sales team now cover and then our plan for future sales team hiring. Thank you.\nKathleen Chien -- Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nAlicia, thank you for the questions. First on the macro question I guess, I think you know for 51job as a company, I do believe we're better positioned than we were in previous cycles simply because of the fact that we actually have a much broader product portfolio, if you will, and our reliance on recruitment product in itself is actually smaller versus the previous cycles that we had gone through. As you know that other HR services as a group actually now account for probably over 30%, 35% of our total sales levels and that was not the situation if we were to roll back the clock to the last sort of significant downturn that we experience. So I think that in terms of the Company overall, I think that having the broader set of product services does help us probably in terms of having more diversification if you will.\nSo, and then in terms of just in general, I mean in the case, if there is going to be a significant downturn of some kind or I really don't think that there's been anything new and alarming that I would point out at this point, I think that there's a lot of uncertainties which is sometimes not so good. But in a way, I mean typically at the end of the year, people are not as active anyway. So I think that it's time for everyone to kind of sit down and revisit with their situation, but think about what they want to do for next year and that your conversation that every single company has to go through and we evaluate how they're going to allocate their resources.\nBut on the other side of the equation is that, at the end the day China's economy in general will continue, I'm sure go through ups and downs, but in terms of the supply of labor, if you will, that number is not increasing overall. So that I think most companies are finding that recruitment in general is the bigger challenge. So I think that people are valuing their human resources more, so that I think that hopefully people won't be doing sort of you know sharp turns if you're trying to cut too thin and then have to make back the -- try to recover once things to kind of turnaround. So we'll see, but I do feel that the company is in better circumstances versus the previous cycles and I don't think that there's anything too alarming in terms of new signs of deterioration that we're seeing at this time. So I guess that's where I will leave it at.\nAnd then in terms of just sales coverage in general, yeah, I mean we are going through different levels of sales reps have different numbers of customers that we expect them to cover and it really depends on the size of the customers and their portfolio. But I would say that in general I would say that we're probably cutting away on average I would say at least 15%, 20% in terms of the number of customers that we expect covered versus our previous of standard if you will. So overall, that is something that we need to kind of work through and that's been something that we've been working on consistently throughout this year as well. So that's kind of the magnitude in terms of the recalibration that we expect to go through and of course like I said the difference in your levels will have different numbers. And so, but that is something that we're going to.\nAlicia Yap -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you, Kathleen.\nKathleen Chien -- Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nThank you, Alicia.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from David Li with Lizard Investors. Please go ahead.\nDavid Li -- Lizard Investors -- Analyst\nHey, thanks guys for taking my question. I have a couple of questions. First, can you just quantify -- maybe give us a little bit more anecdotes on just opportunity in cross selling, upselling in online business, I mean things like number of products are customer taking now or is there a percentage of products -- percentage customers saying, weigh more products versus the other end, so we can get a frame of reference, just how big the opportunity really is longer-term.\nKathleen Chien -- Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYeah, I guess so for us, I mean we have -- I'd say probably, you know, we could probably have 15, 20 product lines that people can -- our sales guidance. And so, and I think that in terms of where we are overall in terms of the cross selling, I mean we are still at a pretty low percentage because we would expect that in this last quarter when we -- where we transacted over 365,000 customers, their take rate across the board is still less than 10% in terms of the other HR services. So that's a low number at this point in time even though that's significantly improved versus where we were last year. So I think that we feel like there's a lot more room for us to continue our penetration and that is something that we'll be working very hard on.\nDavid Li -- Lizard Investors -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And second also, can you talk about the pricing increase you guys have, how should we think about the price increases, is this going to be ongoing or at a certain point in time in a few years from now you guys will stop and then go through another phase of stable pricing again, maybe comment a little bit about that?\nKathleen Chien -- Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nWell, we didn't change any pricing in the third quarter and we had actually done the price change for some of our basic products and services in the first quarter. So it is not something that we expect and we put in on a annual basis. So I don't think that philosophy or that approach or change in the near-term, but you know the upselling doesn't come from necessary the price changes for the like-for-like product, but it's really sort of the ability for us to sell more of the different services into customer account within the online space, so that people are maybe not just utilizing the most basic services or posting, but taking up resume search, priority listing and other options that are available within the online recruitment services portfolio. So I don't think that the price change in itself is something that will be the primary driver of our growth.\nDavid Li -- Lizard Investors -- Analyst\nOkay. And also can you comment little about -- so I'm reading, I'm trying to understand the guidance. So your Q4, the revenue growth guidance implies close to 30% year-on-year revenue growth, but earnings is going to be slightly up, so there is a big margin contraction, I just want to understand maybe I misread the financial statements, the disclosure, is that fair so? And if that's the case, what kind of drove this margin compression in Q4?\nKathleen Chien -- Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nI'm not sure what you're alluding too, but I think in terms of our guidance, I think the top line suggest 25% to 28% on RMB basis. And I don't think that we're suggesting necessary huge money, I don't know if you're looking at year-over-year or quarter-on-quarter, but I think it's pretty much in line with -- this is pretty much in line with our trajectory for this year so far.\nDavid Li -- Lizard Investors -- Analyst\nOkay, because I was looking year-on-year, earnings per share year-on-year, what's that -- what is that on a Q4 basis? Q4 year-on-year based on the guidance growth?\nKathleen Chien -- Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYou can look at that number, but this is on a non-GAAP basis. So I don't know which number you're alluding to, but we can have that discussion, maybe offline in, if this is a kind of specific question, yeah.\nDavid Li -- Lizard Investors -- Analyst\nOkay.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session.
