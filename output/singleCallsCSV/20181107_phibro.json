At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time (Operator Instructions).\nI would now like to turn the call over to Richard Johnson, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.\nRichard Johnson -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Phibro Animal Health earnings call for our first quarter ended September 30th. On the call today is, myself, I'm the Chief Financial Officer. Jack Bendheim is traveling internationally and most likely will not be able to join us. On the call today, we will provide an overview of our quarterly results and also some updated guidance for our fiscal year ending next June. And then, we'll open the lines for your questions.\nBefore we begin, some of the standard things I'd like to remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Section of our Website at pahc.com. We're also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. Today's presentation slides and a replay and transcript of the call will also be available on the website later today. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements section in our earnings press release.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or US GAAP. I refer you to the Non-GAAP financial information section in our earnings press release for a discussion of these measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures, are included in the financial tables that accompany the earnings press release.\nBefore we get into the numbers, let me remind you and remind everyone, that we present our results on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted basis. We present adjusted results that exclude acquisition-related items, that exclude unusual non-operational or non-recurring items, certain other income and expense items as separately reported in our P&L and the income tax effects related to any of those pre-tax adjustments, and also we exclude any -- we exclude any unusual or non-recurring income tax items.\nSo now turning to Page 5. Let's, start by reviewing the highlights for our September quarter. Consolidated sales were $200 million for the quarter, that was a 3% increase versus the same quarter last year. The revenue increase was driven by growth across all of our businesses, including volume growth in the Animal Health business. In addition, our mineral attrition revenues increased due to higher average selling prices, resulting from underlying commodity costs. Reported net income of $16.3 million and diluted EPS of $0.40 per share for the current quarter increased 3% over the prior year and were driven by an increase in gross profit due to the sales growth, offset in part by increased selling, general and administrative expenses as we invested in product and organizational development.\nWe saw a favorable foreign exchange gains, that's a separate line in our P&L. These are primarily related to inter-company balances and we do exclude these items from our adjusted results. And finally, income tax expense increased both due to the higher pre-tax income, but notably due to the one-time effects of exercise of employee stock options, where we had a much larger favorable benefit last year. Our adjusted EBITDA was $30.1 million for the quarter, that was even with the prior year. We saw adjusted EBITDA increase due to improved operating results in the Animal Health and Performance Products businesses. But reduced profitability in the Minerals business and by higher corporate -- higher spending in our corporate cost for development activities in corporate basically offset the favorables.\nSo looking at some selected line items from the P&L. Adjusted gross profit increased $2.3 million or 3% over last year, that was in line with the sales increase. Favorable trends in the Animal Health business were offset by reduced margins in the minerals business. We'll talk more about segment performance on the next few pages. And in total, adjusted SG&A increased $2.3 million, 1.2 million of that increase was in the corporate departments and 1.1 million of the increase was in the Animal Health segment. We have increased spending on product development and organization capabilities to position ourselves for future growth.\nAdjusted net interest expense was slightly favorable. We saw improved earnings from short-term investments, and the adjusted effective income tax rate was 28% for the current quarter. The rate was favorable to last year due to reduced federal statutory income tax rate that came about from the tax reform legislation in December of last year. We do now expect to be subject to another aspect of the new tax legislation, something called an acronym called GILTI, which is the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provisions of the new legislation. Those provisions will add between 1 and 1.5 percentage points to our effective tax rate for the year.\nTurning and looking more closely at the Animal Health business. We had sales of $131.2 million in the quarter. Those sales grew $2.3 million or 2% over last year. The growth was driven by volume and increases in the MSA's another other product category. Our sales of MSAs and other were $87 million in the quarter, a $7.4 million or 9% increase over last year. International sales were the primary growth driver and notably in the cattle sector. We saw good international growth despite unfavorable currency effects in certain countries. Our nutritional specialty product sales of $27 million declined $3.8 million or 12% from last year on weak dairy industry conditions and our poultry business that was roughly equal with last year.\nThe vaccines products -- sales of vaccines were $17.2 million in the quarter, that was a decline of $1.2 million or 7% from last year. And certain of our international markets were affected by turbulent economic conditions and the timing of some distributor orders also had a negative effect. In the Animal Health segment, gross profit increased $3 million on the volume growth on favorable product mix and on continued improved operating efficiencies. We increased our segment SG&A spending by $1.1 million, including investments in increased product and organizational development. That left our adjusted of EBITDA $35.7 million, that was an increase of $2 million or 6% as the sales growth and favorable gross profit results were only partially offset by the increased SG&A spending.\nAnd now, looking at our other segments. The minerals business, mineral nutrition net sales were $54.8 million in the quarter, that was an increase of $2.8 million or 5% over last year. The increase was due to higher commodity pricing. Our selling prices in the minerals business generally move in direct correlation with the underlying commodity costs. At the adjusted EBITDA line, the segment adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 million that was a decrease of $1.2 million from last year, that was due to both unfavorable product mix within the business, as well as a competitive pricing environment. Performance Products segment reported net sales of $14.1 million, our sales were ahead of last year and that resulted in improved adjusted EBITDA. And our corporate expenses were $8.9 million in the quarter, they increased up $1.3 million over last year due to investments in increased development costs.\nNow looking at our capitalization and capital allocation. Our gross leverage ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.5 times at the end of September, and we had $76 million of cash in short-term investments on the books at the quarter end. For the quarter, we used $15 million of cash for operating and investing activities, including $10 million used for business acquisitions, and we also had some seasonal working capital needs that used cash. Notably, we have increased the quarterly dividend by 20%. The increased dividend of $0.12 per share will be paid in December 2018. The increase reflects Phibro's gross positive cash flows and balance sheet strength.\nAnd looking at our updated guidance. We have updated our guidance -- our annual guidance based on our expectations for the effective tax rate for the full-year. Because of the GILTI tax aspects of the recent legislation, we now expect the effective income tax rate to be between 28 and 28.5% for the year. The higher taxes as a result of the higher effective rate resulted in an adjusted EPS of $1.68 to $1.72 per share. That's a reduction of $0.04 to $0.05 per share compared with our initial guidance. We are reaffirming our guidance for sales and profits, but we now consider it more likely to be at the lower end of the ranges provided.\nAnimal Health sales growth in the current year will be more weighted to the MSAs and other product category. We continue to expect nutritional specialty's and vaccines will grow at double-digit rates as our business develops. However, current year growth will be more subdued. Our operating visibility for the year has been reduced by a number of negative or difficult factors, including volatile currencies, economic turbulence in some international countries, unfavorable short-term challenges in the minerals business, continued difficult dairy conditions, ongoing trade disputes and various other factors.\nSo, operator, that's the end of our prepared remarks. If you would please open the line for questions. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nKatie Tryhane -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nHi. This is Katie Tryhane on for Erin. We are just wondering, will this acquisition that you mentioned in the press release, and can just elaborate or quantify that contribution? Thanks.\nRichard Johnson -- Chief Financial Officer\nI didn't hear the word Katie. What was the -- what that we mentioned on the press release?\nKatie Tryhane -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nAbout the acquisition.\nRichard Johnson -- Chief Financial Officer\nThe acquisition. We had -- it's a -- well we did two things in the quarter. One that we talked about as part of our year-end release, we finalized the full purchase of the, it's called MJB swine vaccine's in the United States and that was the bulk of the spending in the quarter, the business acquisition cash flow in the quarter, that was a swine vaccine. We also bought a small vaccine manufacturer and sort of developer of which we haven't released more information about them, but they do have some and we did acquire some interesting technology and potential products for the aquaculture industry.\nKatie Tryhane -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. Got it. That's helpful. And then, can you just speak a little bit more to when you could get back to double-digit growth in vaccines and nutritional specialty's? Thanks.\nRichard Johnson -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. It's hard to say precisely when. I think we'll -- and as we said, we're seeing this year, our visibility is probably more cloudy than it's been in a while. As far as that as what our customers are thinking how their businesses are progressing. So I'm hesitant to say precisely when I think it will be. It's hard to say when. So, can't really put a date on it. But I think we still have a lot of confidence and belief in the portfolio and we see our customers more and more broadly accepting the fact that these are that these are kind of the best products for them to use. But there's a lot of other factors affecting our customers right now.\nKatie Tryhane -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. Got it. Thanks.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael Ryskin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nHey, guys. It's Michael Ryskin on for Derik. Thanks for taking the call. A couple of questions. I want to start with sort of your closing remarks there. You talked about all the challenging conditions. I think the biggest one sort of in my mind and correct me if I'm wrong is the challenges in the dairy markets and how that's affecting the -- some of the nutritional specialty's, that's been ongoing for some time. But it seems like it's really on the broader markets, it gotten worse in recent months. Do you have any sense of visibility into when that will improve? Because in my understanding, it's mostly tied to just go out in the market in terms of oversupply. But if you could just talk about the dairy markets in a little bit more detail.\nRichard Johnson -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Most -- this is a global problem Mike, but most of our business today is in the United States. And so what we're seeing is, dairy producers, the farmer are just getting squeezed unmercifully by the supply demand imbalance. And so, this is only going to sort itself out when the industry probably sorts itself out in terms of only the strong survive and some of the weaker players fall away and supply comes back into more of a balance. There's also global factors of how much of dairy products. And you think of dairy, everyone things of liquid milk, but really we're talking about skimmed milk powder, whole milk powder components of dairy really that go into many foods around the world. So, I think this has been lower longer than then many people have expected. And it will come out of it, the industry will come out of it at some point, but hard to put a timeline on when that might happen.\nMichael Ryskin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nAll right. Thanks. And I was -- especially in vaccines and some of the other segments, you talked about the international impact and some of the timing. I was curious if there is -- if you could breakout a currency straight FX (ph) impact as well?\nRichard Johnson -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Actually, so the currency is not so much -- the currency is effected in many markets, we price in US dollars. But if the local currency devalues by 20% or 30% or more percent all of a sudden that customers price in his market has gone up 20% or 30%. So it's a complicated equation. We don't have a precise number I can give you, but I can tell you it was a negative to our business in several markets. And then and some markets, we do price in local currency and there we've seen currencies devalue that's hurt our top line and hurt our profitability too.\nMichael Ryskin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks. And then one last one if I could squeeze it in. You've talked a lot about investment in SG&A, investment in the portfolio. If you could give a little bit of color on whether the investment is going into the commercial sales force or the R&D, the product pipeline. And specifically on that, if you could talk a little bit more about any products that are coming up that we should keep an eye on or if you have any progress on some their companion animal investments going on there?\nRichard Johnson -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I've said our investment is more in -- so first of all, our investment is focused on the nutritional specialty and vaccine categories. And so, it's really pipeline development. In the case of vaccines, we're looking at some new products, we're also building out and developing the idle vaccine facility that we purchased six months ago or so. And we are spending money on that as we ramp up that facility. Products, I can't give you any specific products, but those are the categories that we're working on. I would say in the companion animal space, we are -- we continue to make progress both in the product that we talked about previously, and another one or two products. And so, we could be out there, at least doing some test marketing in perhaps the next six months. But it's too early to really say where that might go.\nMichael Ryskin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nGreat. And I appreciate all that. Thank you.\nRichard Johnson -- Chief Financial Officer\nAll right.\nOperator\nThank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Richard Johnson for any closing remarks.\nRichard Johnson -- Chief Financial Officer\nAll right, everyone. So that's a wrap for today. We'll talk to you again on our next quarterly call. So until then, take care. Bye now.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.
