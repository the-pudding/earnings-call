At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press * then 0 on your touchstone telephone. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would like now like to introduce your hosts for today's call, Miss Katie Turner. Miss Turner, you may begin.\nKatie Turner -- Head of Investor Relations \nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us on Tilray's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. On today's call are Brendan Kennedy, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Castaneda, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please remember during this call, management may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

While the company believes adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information for investors, the presentation for this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's release for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Brendan.\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us today. On today's call, I will review the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives as we further extend our operations in Canada and internationally to capture the robust opportunities for long-term growth in the global medical and adult use cannabis industries. Mark will then review our third quarter financial results in more detail and discuss our long-term financial targets. After that, we will open the call for your questions.\nAt Tilray, we remain in the early stages of achieving our growth potential. Since our last earnings call at the end of August, our team has been intently focused on making disciplined operational actions, making key strategic investments and generating additional capital to support the sustainable growth we expect to achieve over the next several years.\nFocusing on our third quarter for a moment, we are pleased with all our overall business momentum. Revenue increased 86% from the third quarter last year to $10 million US and total kilogram equivalents sold increased both sequentially and on a year over year basis. Our medical cannabis business continues to perform strongly and we expect the adult use market to become a meaningful part of our business as supply ramps up. Mark will discuss this in more detail, along with where we see our margins heading as we increase sales.\nTaken together, what you will hear is how results reflect the beginning of a global transformation of a $150 billion industry, from a state of prohibition to a state of legalization. As we have discussed with you in the past, this continues to accelerate and become a reality.\nTilray medical cannabis products are now available to patients in 12 countries on five continents, reflecting our position as a leader in global medical cannabis distribution. The foundation we have built in medical cannabis has helped us as we position our business to also benefit the opportunities in adult use cannabis. We believe and our progress to date reflects that companies such as Tilray with trusted brands and multinational supply chains will be the ones that win not only with consumers but regulators as well.\nBuilding our brand and supply chain has become our core focus since we founded Tilray and we have made significant investments to develop the right assortment of products and brands to scale our operations and to recruit the right team. We have built a premium vertically integrated business to pioneer the development of multi-markets around the globe.\nWhile this approach will continue to require initial investments in the short-term, we believe it creates a strong foundation and unique barriers to entry that can be leveraged and scaled in the medium to long-term.\nTo reiterate -- our global growth strategy is focused on six topline performance drivers, all of which we pursue with a focus on discipline, efficiency, and potential to generate strong returns as the business continues to grow. First, increasing our production capacity and inventory to serve the rapidly growing global medical market and adult use market in Canada. Second, maintaining a rigorous focus on quality as we scale. Third, partnering with established distributors and retailers to scale distribution of our products further and faster.\nFourth, developing a differentiated portfolio of brands and products that appeal to a diverse set of patients and consumers. Fifth, expanding the addressable medical market by fostering mainstream acceptance and sixth, continuing to pioneer the future industry by investing in innovation, R&D, and clinical research.\nFrom a production perspective, we are aggressively increasing capacity. Our GMP certified facility in Nanaimo, British Columbia continues to operate at full capacity based on our robust medical cannabis demand. Furthermore, we have both our Tilray Canada and Tilray Portugal entities focused on cultivating, producing, and distributing medical cannabis.\nTilray cannabis serves as a production hub for patients in North America and globally. Once complete, Tilray Portugal will focus on supplying the global medical market, primarily in the EU. Tilray Germany and Tilray Australia and New Zealand are similar in that they focus on importing products and on sales and marketing.\nDuring the third quarter, we received regulatory permits in Canada and Germany to export medical cannabis flower to Germany, making Tilray the first and only company to import both flower and oil medical cannabis products to the Germany market. Our team is committed to maintaining a rigorous focus on quality as we expand for both our medical and adult use cannabis products.\nAs many of you know, [inaudible] in Canada began on October 17th. We were pleased to launch our products in eight provinces. Based on strong initial consumer demand and constrained inventory across the inventory across the industry, we are aggressively scaling capacity. Additionally, we recently signed an agreement with Prince Edward Island to supply cannabis to adult use consumers. We are ramping up capacity at two High Park facilities to support the adult use market, including High Park Farms in Enniskillen, Ontario, and a High Park processing facility in London, Ontario.\nHigh Park Farms recently received a cannabis sales license from Health Canada to supply and sell finished cannabis products within the access to cannabis for medical purposes regulations as well as sales for the adult use market. Last week, we received additional licenses for cultivation areas that had not yet received their licenses, which previously limited the output of this facility in the short-term.\nIn the third quarter, we completed our first outdoor crop harvest in Portugal. This is an exciting corporate milestone. Tilray was the first licensed producer in Canada to ever harvest outdoor crops outside of Canada. We are continuing to build out the facility in terms of our Dutch-style glass house, will we expect to be complete by the first quarter of 2019. Our EU campus located in Portugal has several benefits, including an ideal climate, skilled labor, reduced regulatory costs, and tariff-free access to all EU markets.\nWhen fully operational, our four production facilities located on two continents will allow us to significantly increase our global production output while reducing cost and hedging against regulatory risk. By the end of 2018, we expect to increase our production space to 912,000 square feet, a more than 15-fold increase compared to 2017. With more than a half a billion dollars on our balance sheet, we have the capital needed to build out this capacity.\nOn our existing properties, we have the ability to expand our total production space to 3.8 million square feet. As we scale our capacity in parallel, we continue to develop a differentiated portfolio of brands and products that appeal to a diverse set of patients and consumers by investing in innovation, R&D, and clinical research.\nIn the coming year, we intend to announce our support of additional clinical trials in multiple countries. We have already exported 2:100 CBD oil to the United Kingdom for a pediatric epilepsy clinical trial, received approval from the US government to import a medical cannabis study drug in capsule form for a clinical trial at the University of California, San Diego Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research to examine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of cannabis for essential tremor.\nExported CBD 100 medical cannabis, an oral solution of cannabinoid extract from Canada to Australia to distribute to critically ill children in Australia suffering from intractable epilepsy through a compassionate access scheme.\nIn pursuit of our long-term growth strategies, we believe an important competitive differentiator for Tilray from other companies operating in this industry is our commitment to clinical research and the halo that gives the brand and international medical cannabis markets. Tilray will continue to be a pioneer in both the medical and adult use cannabis industries.\nAs we move forward, we believe we have the financial flexibility to fuel both our near and long-term strategic objectives. We are pleased with the demand and support Tilray received in the completion of our $475 million US convertible senior notes private placement offering on October 10th, subsequent to the end of our third quarter. We intend to use the proceeds to support our strategic growth initiatives as we build a leading world class medical cannabis and adult use production and distribution infrastructure.\nWe will continue to pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Our recent acquisition of Alef Biotechnology for $3.9 million is a great first strategic transaction for us and builds on our previous partnership that started with Alef in February of 2017 to import and distribute Tilray products in Chile and Brazil.\nWe now have the ability to produce, import, and distribute Tilray-branded medical cannabis products throughout Latin America. The Chilean government has been a pioneer, legitimizing and regulating medical cannabis in Latin America. We are excited to be investing in one of the regions most exciting markets for biopharmaceutical development.\nGoing forward, we will continue to pursue strategic M&A transactions that open new territories, increase our capacity, increase our brand offerings through innovative form factors, improve R&D technologies, facilitate retail distribution. We are proud of our operational and strategic achievements thus far and we expect our pace to accelerate in the near-term.\nAs laid out in our prior earnings call, we anticipate the following milestones in the next 6 to 12 months, finding additional adult use supply agreements in Canada, shipping Tilray products to pharmacy chains in Canada, exporting Tilray medical products to new countries, expanding Tilray's medical cannabis product offerings in the international markets we currently serve, extending our existing pharmaceutical partnerships to additional countries and regions, completing the buildout of our facility in Portugal.\nObtaining a manufacturing licenses and GMP certification in Portugal, obtaining production and sales licenses for high parts processing facility in London, Ontario, additional clinical trials, recruiting additional executives from outside the industry to further strengthen our management team, and finally adding strategic partnerships.\nIn summary, we are excited about our opportunities for growth over the next several years. We have consistently taken strategic actions to position Tilray for success in the global medical and adult use cannabis industries. We look forward to continuing to take actions that will drive near and long-term value creation for our shareholders as well as all of those we work with and serve in the medical and adult use markets as well as our employees around the world.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Castaneda -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Brendan. Good afternoon to those of you joining us on today's call and webcast. It is a pleasure to be speaking with you today. We are pleased with our third quarter financial results and significant growth and opportunities that lie ahead. Focusing on our Q3 results in more detail, please note all of the financial information we discuss today is prepared in accordance with US GAAP and is in US dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nQ3 revenue was $10 million representing an increase of 86% compared to the third quarter last year. Revenue growth was driven by increased patient demand, bulk sales and export sales. Extract products represented a greater mix and approximately 46% of revenue for the third quarter of 2018 compared to 18% of revenue for the same period in the last year.\nWe are pleased with our medical cannabis revenue, though we do expect to see an inflection in our growth trajectory throughout 2019, when adult use revenue from additional form factors would be included in our results since it went into effect in mid-October.\nMoving on to operational metrics -- total kilogram equivalents increased over twofold to 1,612 kilograms from 684 kilograms in the same quarter of 2017. The overall average net selling price per gram was $7.53 in the prior year and $6.24 in the third quarter of 2018. The reduction was primarily due to an increase in bulk sales of the percentage of total revenue compared to the prior year's quarter.\nExcluding bulk sales and looking at Canadian direct to patient sales, our average net selling price per gram increased 9.2% to $8.22 compared to $7.33 per gram. On the production side, we expect significant increase throughout 2019 as we expand our capacity to 90 metric tons as we bring our Ontario Greenhouses and Portugal facilities fully online.\nGross margin for the third quarter decreased to 31% from 55% in the same period last year. As a result, a procurement of third-party supply and a larger portion of our revenue being attributed to the bulk sale channels. As we indicated on last quarter's call, we continue to balance our product supply as we were long THC extracts and short CBD products. We expect continued balancing through the end of the year while we ramp up our production. Additionally, margins were impacted as we incurred start-up costs in ramping our cultivation.\nLonger-term, we continue to expect 50%+ gross margins as we lower our costs of greenhouse and outdoor cultivation and as we ramp those facilities past their start-up phase. We also expect to reduce revenue per unit as we begin selling wholesale in the adult use markets, whereas today we are selling direct to patient.\nTotal operating expense increased to $23.1 million, which includes $11.2 million in non-cash stock compensation expense. Excluding the non-cash stock compensation costs, operating expenses increase to $11.9 million from $5.1 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to $4.6 million increase in general administrative expenses associated with higher professional fees and increased resources to support our growth and expansion for the start-up operations for adult use.\nNet loss for the quarter was $18.7 million or $0.20 per share compared to $1.8 million or $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Net loss included non-cash stock compensation charge of $11.2 million compared to $35,000.00 charged in the prior year. About $6.8 million of non-cash compensation charge over performance triggered upon IPO. Excluding the non-cash compensation charge, net loss was $7.5 million or $0.08 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $7.4 million compared to a loss of $1.7 million in the third quarter of last year. The increase in net loss and adjusted EBITDA was probably due to increase in operating expenses related to continued growth, expansive international teams, and costs related to the IPO.\nTurning to the balance sheet, we entered the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $119 million. In October, we announced the pricing of a $475 million convertible senior notes due 2023 and a private placement resulting in proceeds before expenses of about $460 million. We intend to use the proceeds for working capital, feature acquisitions, general corporate purposes, and repay existing mortgage.\nAs we look ahead, we do not provide guidance. However, we are aware that guidance does exist for our performance. The slow start and rollout of adult use across the country has been impacted by many factors, including the timing of licenses, distribution of retail infrastructure. We are not immune to these factors and they will impact our results. However, we have witnessed in all markets that have transitioned from an elicit to legal market have had bumpy beginnings, then thrive once the infrastructure and start-up periods have passed.\nOn a longer-term basis, we intend to further build our early relationship in the global cannabis industry to achieve strong growth for years to come. We see an opportunity to capture a sizable portion of this market with an estimate gross margin of 50%+, adjusted EBITDA margins of 25% to 30%. The EBITDA margins are based on the legal markets that exist today. As new markets are added, we will invest and develop those markets, which would have a short-term impact on those margins, but also provide for greater revenue upside.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Brendan and I are now available to take your questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press the * then 1 key on your touchstone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the # key. To prevent any background noise, we ask you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated.\nOur first question comes from Mike Grondahl with Northland Securities.\nMike Grondahl -- Northland Securities -- Analyst\nThank you, guys. In the adult use market in Canada, what would you call out as the one or two sort of biggest challenges or hurdles that exist in the market today and how long do you think until those go away?\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think the biggest hurdle that we weren't expecting was the change in retail operations in Ontario. Obviously, initially, we were expecting four physical retail stores to open up in Ontario and with the change in government in Ontario, they decided to initially have online only and not to license and open physical stores in the largest province by population until next April.\nOver the short-term, it definitely negatively impacted the industry and in some ways negatively impacted the consumer experience because if you look at Washington or California or Oregon, Nevada, day one, October 17th, you would have seen a lot of people in physical stores. I think over the long-term, starting next April, you're going to see private companies and entrepreneurs open physical stores much faster, much more quickly than the crime corporations would have, than the OCS would have.\nWhile it is a negative impact over the short-term, starting next April, it will have a very positive impact. That change in regulation will have a positive impact, not only on Tilray but on the entire Canadian industry.\nMike Grondahl -- Northland Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. Then with the Tilray brand out in the marketplace the last month, any early feedback or read? What are you seeing so far?\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt's really too early to tell. We thought it was really interesting the product mix that people chose that people chose province by province as all these different retail locations were being set up. It was really the buyers who were picking the initial brands and initial products and were looking forward to those choices being made really by consumers, consumers picking brands and products they love. That's really going to be what determines long-term success in this industry in Canada.\nMark Castaneda -- Chief Financial Officer\nMike, with the imbalance we have today with more demand than supply, everything is selling out, so it's really hard to tell what consumers are going to prefer longer-term. Also, consumers are limited on their form factors. So, as vape cartridges and edibles and beverages hit the market within the next year, we'll really see what consumers want. This is really kind of short-term high-demand for every product the consumer can get their hand on.\nMike Grondahl -- Northland Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Graeme Kreindler with Eight Capital.\nGraeme Kreindler -- Eight Capital -- Analyst\nYeah, hi, gentlemen. I was wondering could you elaborate a bit on the company strategy in terms of balancing inventory needs for medical international markets as well as adult use, what the strategy is going ahead?\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, in terms of the international markets, our strategy is really on getting Portugal fully up and running, licensed. Two weeks ago, three weeks ago, I was in Portugal for our first outdoor harvest there. That was exciting. As far as I know, that makes us the only LP in Canada that's ever grown a product outdoors, ever harvested a product outdoors, which is an exciting development for us and we're looking forward to processing that product and distribution it inside the EU and potentially in other international markets.\nOur greenhouse in Portugal will be completed at the end of this month, have plants in it. Next month, our GMP processing facility will be complete in Q1. So, that will really -- what we'll do is that will replace the product we currently export from Canada. We'll begin to supply products inside of the EU from the EU and that's part of our international part of your question.\nWhat has been a little bit surprising in Canada really leading up to October 17th, one of the things that was surprising is that most people in the industry were expecting some decrease in demand from patients and clearly, for us, as part of our long-term strategy, patients come first and we didn't expect a run up in demand within the patient population pre-legalization. We actually thought the opposite. Most of our peers thought the opposite. What happened was we saw a significant increase in demand from patients in the days and weeks prior to legalization. That was pretty counterintuitive to what we were expecting.\nGraeme Kreindler -- Eight Capital -- Analyst\nCan you elaborate a bit maybe how you see those patient figures developing now that we're about a month in from adult use? How sticky do you think that is considering what we talked about on the infrastructure, the adult use market? How do you see that developing over the next couple of months?\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt's really hard to predict based on a number of different things. In some markets such as Colorado, you see different tax rates between the adult use consumers and the medical patients. You don't really see that in Canada, which is very surprising. Medical cannabis is really the only product prescribed by a physician that is taxed in Canada. So, depending on taxes, depending on form factor, if they're different form factors between adult use and medical and different tax rates, we would expect continued growth in the medical patient base.\nI think the other significant development that we expect in Canada really in the next few months is that Canada is the only country in the world where Tilray products are available where they're not available in pharmacies. That's going to change. Everywhere else, Tilray products are available in pharmacies.\nIn Canada, they're not, but with companies such as Shoppers Drug Mart and Pharmasave, we do expect these products to be available in pharmacies fairly soon. That will be interesting to see in a place like Ontario, where there aren't retail stores open, but you may see Tilray products available in physical pharmacies. It will be really interesting to see how that impacts the patient base.\nGraeme Kreindler -- Eight Capital -- Analyst\nMy last question here quickly -- for the revenue figure, the bulk sales to other licensed producers -- can you disclose what that was at the total topline there?\nMark Castaneda -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt was about 50%.\nGraeme Kreindler -- Eight Capital -- Analyst\nThank you very much, gentlemen.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fortune with Roth Capital Partners.\nScott Fortune -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst\nThank you. Can you update the progress on High Park and to eliminate the supply issues for you guys going forward with fourth quarter and going forward for the rec side of things?\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. There are two High Park facilities. One is High Park Farms and it's still in Ontario. Obviously, by the name, it's a cultivation facility. I'll walk through that one first. The High Park Farms facility is now fully licensed. We had been waiting on two zones about 50% of the new facility that we had upgraded, we had been waiting on that to be licensed for lots of, I guess, four months, five months, something like that.\nIt was finally licensed last Friday. That took longer than we expected. But we are excited to get that portion of the facility up and running. So, we've been taking clones to put plants in those two zones and that will significantly increase our capacity at High Park Farms. The entire facility is now fully licensed.\nWe are currently processing at High Park Farms. Processing and packaging finished products for the adult use market -- we have submitted our full licensing application and all the documentation for the High Park processing facility in London, Ontario and anticipate having that facility licensed within our expected timeframe.\nScott Fortune -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst\nOkay. Are you looking at all the supply issues to potential bridge by buying wholesale at all?\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe have been looking at lots of different supply agreements and looking at all of the different farmers, different suppliers, cultivators in Canada. The challenge is really twofold. One is that over the last year, we kept hearing about all of this capacity that people were building out and when we went to buy some of that supply, it's just not available. People tended to exaggerate their capacity and tended to exaggerate the metric tons they were going to be producing, so there's far less supply than frankly we expected.\nThe second thing that we're seeing is that there's far less quality supply than we expected when we've gone out to do our own inspections for quality and look at the product that is available, it's a much lower quality than our standards would allow us to purchase. Both of those things have been very surprising. We've often said that five years from now, ten years from now, we would hope to buy all of our supply from farmers, not only in Canada but in other countries around the world, but it seems like a lot of companies are having trouble scaling.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company.\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nHey, Brendan, Mark, congrats on your quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple -- I'm curious your view, I guess, on the shifting political landscape in the United States here post-midterm elections. Both sessions are out. It would appear the potential for medical cannabis legalization is more promising, but I wanted to hear your view.\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So, obviously, there were a lot of big developments over the last few weeks, not only in the United States but in places like Mexico. In the US, we saw one state, Michigan, legalize cannabis for adult use, which brings us to ten states. Then two states legalized for medical purposes, Utah and Missouri, two very conservative states. You saw a very conservative senator, Orrin Hatch, come out in favor of legalizing medical cannabis in Utah.\nObviously one House race was really important to us in the Texas 32nd, Colin Allred beat Pete Sessions. I think he was an 11-time incumbent. Pete Sessions, as Chairman of the House Rules Committee, had prevented numerous medical cannabis and cannabis bills from coming to the floor of the House for a vote. So, we are optimistic that without Pete Sessions, we will start to see more bills come out in the next Congress.\nI think that all of those things along with obviously Jeff Sessions, drug war dinosaur, no longer being Attorney General, are all positive signs for this industry. If I were going to point to two more characteristics, indicators, we're now at a point where 93% of Americans believe that medical cannabis should be legal, 9 out of 10. You can't get 9 out of 10 Americans to agree on anything, but they agree on that.\nThen 65% of Americans believe that cannabis should be legal for adult use. Looking at that number and a subset of that number, 51% of republicans believe that cannabis should be legal for adult use. So, for the first time, a majority of republicans believe that this should happen. So, all of those things point to the fact that a majority of Congress now comes from a district that have legalized cannabis or medical cannabis in some form.\nThis is a bipartisan issue at a time where there aren't a whole lot of bipartisan issues. I think you'll see Mitch McConnell include hemp cultivation in the next farm bill. Senator McConnell will do that. That will allow for CBD products to be more widely available in the US. So, we're optimistic about the long-term prospects in the United States.\nI guess finally, we talked about Mexico, but we're also really optimistic about other countries around the world that are legalizing medical cannabis. We're now at a point where 35 countries have legalized medical cannabis and it's really clear to me how we get from 35 to 40 to 50 to 60 countries that have legalized medical cannabis in a relatively short amount of time, two or three years, I think that's where we'll be.\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you. The second question from me is back in the US, your view on multi-state operators -- obviously, they continue to scale, you saw a big deal announced just today. Do you feel like you're losing your first mover advantage or being eroded without the federal or legal path for you to do business in the United States?\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think that we have lots of different advantages. One, we have over $500 million in cash to invest today. We have a public company stock as currency to conduct M&A transactions around the world. We are able to be listed on NASDAQ rather than other exchanges that some of the multi state operators are listed on outside of the United States. We're able to distribute our products around the world and comply with not only import and export laws in the countries in which we operate, but also international treaties.\nI think that in September, we announced an export from Canada to the US for a clinical trial at the University of California, San Diego. I think that gives us advantages to very quickly deploy capital in the US if -- I should say when the farm bill passes and when we see something like the States Act pass. So, all those things would lead us to deploy capital swiftly into the US.\nI think besides the exchanges where you see the multi-state operators list and the lack of liquidity that those stocks have, I think another disadvantage you see among the state operators is that all of the products they produce and all the products they sell within an individual state are cultivated and processed and packaged and distributed solely within that state.\nI think that puts them at a distinct disadvantage when federal law changes in the US because they're going to have all these cultivation facilities licensed in all these different states. Companies such as ours would deploy massive amounts of capital in one single location or two single locations in one or two states and quickly move that product from state to state, assuming federal legalization.\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nThank you very much. Best of luck.\nOperator\nThank you. Our final question comes from Tamy Chen with BMO Capital Markets.\nTamy Chen -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks. The first question is I just wanted to clarify -- this quarter, the Q3, you did not shift any product to the adult use market, is that correct?\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThat is correct, Tamy.\nTamy Chen -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nCould you speak to how your adult use shipments starting in October, how you performed versus what your commitment was to the provinces and also for this initial October shipment, was it all out of an enamel facility or did you have products shipping out from the High Park Greenhouse as well.\nMark Castaneda -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. We finally received our license from the greenhouse in Ontario and we did ship product from that greenhouses as well. So, we do have a good start and I think if you look around the industry, no one can keep up with the demand and we're in the same boat as everybody else. We can't produce product fast enough as the demand is coming.\nBrendan Kennedy -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThere was a bit of a dance at the end of the quarter where we had product packaged and palletized and ready to ship, but several of the destinations, the distributors, the corporations didn't have licenses to receive the products. So, that's sort of a dance that took place across many of our peers in Canada.\nTamy Chen -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nRight. At the High Park Greenhouse, do you know what your current run rate production is at this point?\nMark Castaneda -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo, as we said, our total production is around 66 metric tons. We had only half of our facility licensed. That license just came in this past week. So, effectively, theoretically about 33 would be the theoretical capacity. Now that we have the rest of the licenses in place, we'll be able to start planning those. So, we'll get closer to that 60.\nTamy Chen -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nRight. Okay. Again, on the wholesale, can you speak to the pricing that you're getting so far in the adult use market?\nMark Castaneda -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo, because of our relationships with our retailers, we don't disclose our pricing. You will see that in the queue, the overall averages, but we were informed not to disclose the pricing with our customers.\nTamy Chen -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nMy last question is I'm just wondering in terms of your mix, you mentioned your long, I believe it's THC but not enough CBD. I'm just wondering why that is. I would have thought in the medical market, you have more CBD products. I'm just wondering why there's this mix difference right now.\nMark Castaneda -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo, we are not planning enough CBD initial. The CBD demand outstripped our supply and we had some extra THC oils and that's what we sold wholesale and we've made commitments to sell that about a year ago. So, we felt we would have plenty of THC oil, but on the CBD side, we just couldn't keep up. It's also a very popular international product.
