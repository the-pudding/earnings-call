Good afternoon everybody. Welcome to trivago N.V.'s financial results conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Rolf Schromgens, trivago's CEO and Managing Director; and Axel Hefer, our CFO and Managing Director. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, May 1, 2019, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.\nAs always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the Company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nYou will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the Company's IR website at ir.trivago.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Rolf.\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nWelcome everybody. Many thanks for joining our first quarterly earnings call in 2019. Let me start with thanking the team for a very good quarter, not only in terms of financial results, but especially for how they showed progress on important operational topics.\nWe are very pleased with the start into the new year. We repeatedly said that the key improvement we want to see for the first two quarters is on profitability of our business and profits turned out stronger than we expected. This will now give us more confidence and more flexibility to invest into growth opportunities in the second half of the year.\nBefore we go into the numbers, let me point out some operational highlights that we have made -- that have made a significant step forward. On brand marketing, testing and iterating new spots concepts, these are focusing on clearly messaging our competency in aggregating prices and inventory. We're already seeing promising results in various countries.\nOn back-end infrastructure, we have successfully rolled (Technical Difficulty) infrastructure (ph) to 100% of our traffic, which is also now running in the cloud. That allowed us to switch off the core of the old application, which has grown over 15 years. Notably, our cloud shift was done with very little impact on our P&L (ph).\nOn alternative accommodations, we continued to make progress to broaden our offering and increase visibility on vacation rentals and private apartments within one single integrated search. On registrations (Technical Difficulty) to ramp up our bookings (Technical Difficulty) that will give us in the future the chance to continuously learn and improve performance of individual users.\nOn our mobile app. We are continuing to shift branded users to our app. It is an ongoing continuous process over the last years, but we see that our latest changes positively improved performance on most metrics.\nOn advertiser relations, we used Q1 to hold executive summit with our core advertisers here in Dusseldorf. We brought the teams together to align perspective and to drive joint projects. We are very happy with the progress and are working together to maximize user experience throughout the funnel.\nWe are very pleased with the start into the new year, which you find summarized on Slide 5. Following our optimization measures in advertising spend, in Q1, we managed to turn our business from our largest loss in trivago history to our most profitable first quarter. We reached a net income of EUR7.8 million (Technical Difficulty) EUR29.6 million from a net loss of EUR21.8 million in the first quarter 2018. As well adjusted EBITDA was EUR20.9 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of EUR21.9 million, so up EUR42.8 million year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin reached a Q1 record of 10%.\nWe reduced our advertising spend by 36% compared to Q1 2018, and in line with our expectations, our total revenue decreased to EUR208.8 million or by 20%. Also thanks to a broadly stable commercialization in Q1, our return on advertising spend or ROAS improved significantly to 137% compared to 108% in Q1 2018.\nI would like to take a bit of time to explain the story behind the development of two of our key metrics that we explain on Slide 6. From a marketing standpoint, the optimization of our advertising spend resulted in a reduction of qualified referrals (Technical Difficulty) the likelihood of residing in a booking.\nFrom the product side, we continued innovation in order to increase user engagement. Higher engagement on trivago is ultimately resulting in higher retention, higher quality of leads we send to our advertisers, but also a lower number of qualified referrals. As a result, the two underlying drivers of referral revenue, QR and RPQR has been impacted by these optimizations and as such the development has diverged. As we lap these effects in the third quarter this year, we expect to see more stability in these drivers going forward.\nIn summary, we continue to see the positive results of the measures we have undertaken at the end of Q2 2018 resulting in improved profitability. This is highlighted clearly on Slide 7, where you see the two different stories pre and post Q3 2018. We believe we are now on a stable profitability base as we have optimized ad spend and continue to do so.\nWhile we showed a negative contribution development for the first two quarters in 2018, contribution improved very consistently for the last three quarters. The current quarter showed a EUR37 million higher contribution than the first quarter 2018. A very similar development is seen in our adjusted EBITDA margin, which we improved by 18% quarter-over-quarter. We are aiming on delivering long-term profitable growth and believe that we are on the right path to do so.\nAnother continuing topic we have been updating you on is on -- is our ongoing effort to onboard alternative accommodation providers. We are proud to say we have now crossed 1.8 million properties and we will continue on our path of gradually increasing our alternative accommodation inventory. We believe that alternative accommodation will improve our offering significantly by making it more comprehensive and cover long tail destinations more effectively. Making it all available on one integrated search is a key focus for us. Given the long tail nature of a inventory, we believe we are already approaching relevant scale from an inventory perspective and are testing ways to leverage our inventory to better serve our users given the context of their search.\nAs always, we want to give you an update on our advertiser segmentation. Q1 2019 is again broadly in line with the historic distribution. Our two largest advertisers have slightly lowered share in the order of 1% to 2% as other advertisers on our platform have picked up share compared to Q1 2018. Overall, our marketplace and auction dynamics remain stable. As we said, we continued to invest into the relationship work with our advertisers and are very happy about their commitment to work together on important projects.\nTo conclude, this quarter is in continuation of measures we have put in place last year and we see our profit improvement as a clear positive sign that we are reaching a solid base. Our marketplace remains stable with no significant change in our commercialization and we improved the dialogue with our advertisers. Our next focus will be on delivering profitable growth. We consequently optimize our product toward higher engagement to improve perceived value and ultimately retention.\nLet me now hand over to Axel to take a more detailed look at the numbers.\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Rolf. Looking at our KPIs, our advertising spend optimization is working. We reduced our advertising spend Q1 2019 over 2018 by 37%, which resulted in a reduction of referral revenue of only 20% Q1 2019 over Q1 2018. We have started our optimization late in the second quarter 2018, which means that our year-over-year comparisons will start to ease end of the second quarter.\nAs Rolf has already mentioned, the product and marketing optimizations also had a significant impact on our key KPIs. As you can see on Slide 12, our qualified referrals dropped by 32% to 129.3 million, while our global revenue per quantified referral increased by 18% to EUR1.59.\nLooking at our segments, Developed Europe on page 13, benefited from our strong loyal user base increasing revenue per qualified referral by 26%, while advertising spend and qualified referrals dropped 28% and 32%. In Americas on page 14, our revenue per qualified referral improved by 13%, while our advertising spend and qualified referrals decreased by 40% and 35%. The Rest of the World segment on page 15, showed an increase in revenue per qualified referral of 13%. Advertising spend and qualified referrals decreased by 43% and 29%.\nComing to our guidance on page 17, we're on the path we set ourselves in 2018 and are pleased with our performance to-date. Given our performance in the first quarter and the momentum we see in the second quarter, we expect to reach the higher end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance of EUR50 million to EUR75 million.\nThe strong start in 2019 is giving us the flexibility to invest into opportunities that might arise in the course of the year. We expect both advertising expense and referral revenue to decline in the second quarter and to grow in the third and the fourth quarter.\nElie Matta -- Head of Corporate Development\nI think with that we can move over to questions. So operator, can we open the floor for Q&A please?\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nWe can indeed. Thank you very much indeed, sir. (Operator Instructions) Now from Deutsche Bank, your first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley, and your line is now open.\nChris Kuntarich -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nThis is Chris on for Lloyd. Just a question on loyalty rates, are you guys making any progress on getting them integrated? We've seen the headlines in some recent hotel deals with some of the OTAs, I'm just curious how this has changed how hotels are able to syndicate their loyalty pricing in metasearch? Thanks.\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nYes, you might have seen that we currently have already implementation of the first loyalty rates on trivago and we are currently working on integrating more advertisers to that. Still this is -- we are still in an early stage and we are continuously like trying to engage more advertisers into showing loyalty rates. Currently, we're focusing more on hotel chains because this seems to be the most attractive start to us, but we're also interested in getting OTAs onboard.\nChris Kuntarich -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you very much indeed sir. Your next question from Cowen and Company comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman, and your line is now open, sir.\nKevin Kopelman -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks a lot. So I had a question on Q2 trends given the bumpy comps as you start to anniversary the beginnings of your profit optimization. Can you give us more color on how you're expecting the second quarter revenue growth and ad spend growth to look year-over-year as compared to the first quarter? Thanks.\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sir. So as I said, we started to our -- we started our marketing optimization in the second quarter end of -- in the end of the second quarter 2018. So we expect the second quarter to have a slower reduction in advertising expense than the first quarter 2019 compared year-over-year and an improved revenue trajectory. However, revenue and advertising expense, we expect to be down year-over-year.\nKevin Kopelman -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nOkay. Got it. And then you alluded to the Q1 -- the stronger start to profitability to the year allowing you to invest more later in the year. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude that you're contemplating on advertising spend growth for the second half of the year?\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nWe only guide adjusted EBITDA overall, but we expect to ramp up where we see opportunity in the third and the fourth quarter. So we're expecting in both quarters an increase.\nKevin Kopelman -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks. And then just one last one on free cash flow, you had a strong free cash flow conversion in the first quarter. Is there anything to call out there and how do you see that playing out relative to EBITDA this year?\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nThere are no fundamental changes in our cash conversion. Quarter-over-quarter, you can have some volatility, particularly on the working capital side. But overall, there is no fundamental change in our cash conversion coming out of adjusted EBITDA.\nKevin Kopelman -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nThanks, Axel.\nOperator\nThank you very much indeed sir. Now from SunTrust, your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan, and your line is open, sir.\nNaved Khan -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nThanks a lot. Just a couple. So in your prepared commentary, I think you guys called out some muted performance in the U.K. and weakness in Australia. Wonder what was driving that. And was there any Easter impact to the quarter as well? And then just on the RPQR front, Europe seems to be doing better versus the other markets. Is that something that's structural just because that's your core market or the earliest market? What should I go to think about it?\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nYes, absolutely. So in terms of regional performance, we indeed see some softness in the U.K. in the first quarter. To what extent that has been impacted by the Brexit situation, is very difficult for us to say. But the U.K. underperformed the overall Developed Europe segment in the first quarter. That is correct.\nIn Australia, the first quarter was also weaker than you would normally expect the first quarter to be, so a different seasonal trend. And it might have been impacted by the ongoing investigations in Australia and the publicity around that. But again, it is very difficult to say for sure.\nOn your third question, the development in Europe. Indeed, we see a stronger development in Developed Europe, which is the region where we've been active for the longest time, where our brand is strongest and where our loyal user base is strongest. And we believe that that foundation that we've built over the last years has led to the better performance compared to our newer and more recent markets.\nNaved Khan -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks. And then maybe on Easter, were there any shift in revenue possibly from Q1 into second quarter?\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nSo looking at the previous years, we have not seen a lot of Easter seasonality overall in our business, so we also would not see a big shift into Q2.\nNaved Khan -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you, sir. Now from Mizuho Securities, you have a question from the line of James Lee, and your line is now open, sir.\nJames Lee -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nYeah, thanks for taking my question here. A couple of questions here. First one, just curious what you guys think, what is the implication, the new renew agreement between Marriott and Expedia? It seems like the agreement is more favorable toward the hotel at this point in time and how you are adjusting your strategy accordingly here?\nAnd secondly, on your landing page assessment, anything new that you learned from the consumer perspective? Obviously, the reason you're doing this, you want to be able to drive better conversion. You've been doing that for more than a year. Just wanted to see if there's a meaningful lift to conversion that makes this exercise worthwhile. Thanks.\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nI think in general, it's really difficult for us to comment on like Expedia's contracts they arrange with their hotel chains. You know, in total, you have to say like what is currently the total part of the Marriott inventory on trivago, like what is going -- coming into Expedia. So I would not assume that a change in that contract would have a significant impact on the trivago business.\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nOn your second question, we -- on the relevant assessment, we continuously optimize our algorithms and continue to test what the impact is and what the results are and calibrate the algorithm. Other than that, there is not much to say. We believe that it is in the interest of our users and of trivago overall. But yeah, we are continuously optimizing and measuring the impact.\nJames Lee -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nAnd if I could ask a follow up question. Obviously you guys made some product change last quarter and one thing you did is showing the total price for stay in sort of per night, and that's kind of reducing clickout. I'm just curious what is the benefit of doing that from your perspective since like you are giving -- is the reason doing that is you want to give advertiser a better ROI, you're willing to sacrifice revenue in near term to make your advertiser happy? Is that the right reason why you're doing it? And also secondly on advertising plan for 2019, anything different that you're doing this year versus last year? And maybe can you give us maybe update or break out your channel or your traffic mix by channel? Thanks.\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, thanks a lot. I think that's a very good observation. It was -- though it was one of the changes we did, I think there were several changes that all went into that direction that you described. And it's correct to say that we are sacrificing short-term revenue for like creating higher lead quality on one hand, but on the other hand also a higher engagement, higher interaction on the trivago site. So if you keep in mind that in the long run, it will be very vital for us to focus on retention. Retention can be only built up if you connect a strong brand with a strong product experience. Product experience is depending on like how you engage, how much you engage with the website. So we are very interested in delivering as much information as possible. So if we can get clarity to telling our users, give users more information like providing next to the weekly rate -- sorry, the daily rate, providing the rate for the full stay, this is more information. And more information will also lead, of course, to less clickouts to check on the advertiser side, will lead to a higher interaction on trivago and ultimately we hope that it also leads them to a higher retention in the future. And that is -- that's a basic strategy that is shown in several product improvement that we did over the last year and the last quarter.\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nOn your question regarding the marketing strategy for the year and the mix, we continue to believe that a mix of roughly 50/50 between branded and performance is a healthy mix. Branded advertisement explains our value proposition whereas performance advertisement does show the benefit of our product life, and our experience so far has been that the combination of those two marketing channels in balance is very effective and works very well for our product.\nIf you now look into the specific sub-channels in brand, online video is obviously becoming over time more and more important where the younger generations not consuming as much linear TV as the older generations, so that needs to be substituted by other means of brand advertisement. On the performance marketing side, Google Hotel Ads is becoming more and more important for us: a) because it gets more and more visibility overall in the market; and b) because we have scaled up significantly now being live in more than 50 markets. But we haven't fully scaled up our inventory in all of these markets, so we don't fully leverage the breadth of our offering and the breadth of the rates that are available on trivago. That should lead to an increase in Google Hotel Ads as in our performance marketing mix.\nJames Lee -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nGreat. And sorry for being so nosy, do you have an updated mix by channel -- traffic mix by channel?\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nNo, we don't.\nJames Lee -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. All right. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you very much indeed, sir. Now from Goldman Sachs, your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry, and your line is now open sir.\nHeath Terry -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe help us just aggregate the improvement in ROAS this quarter. How much of that is coming from just simple reduction and the lower performing spend on the platform versus actually seeing any sort of improvement in efficiency either from the prices of the ad units that you're buying coming down or your conversion rates going up? And if there was a way to look at this spend -- the spend that you had this quarter on a like-for-like or sort of same-store sales basis, would we be seeing an improvement in ROAS on a year-over-year basis just looking at the remaining spend versus the comparable spend last year?\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nIt is a combination of both. That is true for sure. So we have various initiatives where we are optimizing our marketing spend, improving our efficiency on the bidding in performance marketing, our bidding algorithms, bidding efficiency, the targeting of our bidding, but also on the branded marketing side, on our messaging, we have as Rolf said earlier, we are now running more variety of creatives in parallel, testing them against each other and getting positive impacts out of that. In the selection of the ad breaks that we're using for creatives, we are making progress. To disassemble the overall spend optimization from the improved efficiency is very difficult. And yes, I mean, I can only say that that we have -- we are benefiting from both trends definitely and that has led to the significant improvement.\nOn the product driven improvements, improved conversion, you can see part of that in the revenue per qualified referral. However, you can't take the full effect because there is also a mix effect in there. So the revenue per qualified referral is also benefiting from the more targeted and more optimized marketing spend, which is increasing the average quality of the traffic as well. So it's not all coming from product, it's also impacted by our marketing strategy.\nHeath Terry -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat, thanks. And then to follow up on one of the questions before or really one of your comments about looking to bring more hotels onto the platform. As we increasingly see hotels focusing on their direct booking options, what are the reasons that you get from hotels as to why they're not leveraging trivago to drive bookings directly to their hotels? It would seem like the metasearch model, particularly the way that you guys have built your metasearch model would be an appealing option for them in terms of driving additional direct traffic?\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I think it's very true. I think intuitively you would assume that it's very appealing and there's really no rational reason not to be present on trivago. Still like managing a small hotel has also a large complexity, like I mean, you have to do a lot of stuff at the same time and like focusing on your online marketing is just one of the many things that you have to do as a hotel owner. So we should not underestimate that hotel owners are confronted with a high complexity. So for them, I think we have to make it as easy as possible and that what we're working on that when we talk to individual hoteliers that we show like how easy it is to integrate on the trivago platform, to running campaigns on the trivago platform. We are successful with that, but it's also like a process. It's a process. It's a process to talk to every individual hotelier, and you see when you're looking at the different OTAs of the market, you see also a difference in like how strong their inventory is, so they also have to put effort into that, although it's probably also a no-brainer to put your inventory on several OTAs. But still you have to convince every single individual hotelier one by one and that's just a continuing effort and that takes time.\nHeath Terry -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you very much sir. Now your next question from Morgan Stanley comes from the line of Brian Nowak, and your line is now open, sir.\nAlaxandar Wang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi, it's Alax Wang sitting on for Brian. Just two questions. One you talked about, I think, your branded marketing new spots concept. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about that and how maybe that messaging differs? And understanding that you still believe 50/50 mix between brand and performance is still the right long-term mix, but are you perhaps leaning into branded marketing more heavily in the second half of 2019? And the second question around, I think Rolf mentioned, the advertisers summit you guys held in 1Q, maybe if you could just talk to us about some broad themes that came out of that and how that might differ for your larger advertisers versus some of the other advertisers?\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So on the creatives that we are currently running globally, you obviously have the Mr. trivago concept, the studio or limbo world concept that is still working very well. In addition to that, we are running real world Mr. trivago concept, where you have a real world non-studio situation that people can relate to very easily that have some anchoring with our very known spokesperson. And a third category that we are testing is basically with a passive narrator with a real life situation, which has the benefit that it can be translated into other markets much more quickly and much cheaper, which means that you can produce a lot more of these spots for the same budget. And we see positive results of all three and overall more -- not hedged, sounds a bit negative, but have more variety and more things to choose from for every individual market. So I think we've made a significant progress there and we'll continue to test various different concepts against each other.\nIn terms of spend that doesn't necessarily mean that we will increase the share of branded spend in the overall mix. As I said before, we believe roughly in the 50/50 traffic usage mix, and I don't see a reason why we should deviate from that. In terms of messaging, the messaging focus is clearly on our main value proposition, which is breadth of inventory and attractiveness of rates. And the secondary messaging that we have launched recently, and so far is performing very well, is the alternative accommodation apartment value proposition that Rolf talked about and that we are again seeing more and more traction on the platform and we believe our offering is getting better and better as we speak.\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nOn the advertiser summit, of course, with a couple of hundred advertisers, you can't do like the same format with all of them, right? So they are like -- it's different formats for depending on like how intensively we work together with the different advertisers. But with our key advertisers, we have invited them over to Dusseldorf with the executive teams, so not only with the account managers, but with the high level marketing teams involved, sitting here on campus for two days. On one hand, we give them a glimpse of a lot of things that we do here at trivago to go into learning sessions and give them an idea of our culture, our processes and so on and so on. And on the other side, we work together on strategic projects because we truly believe that at the end, the maximum value is created. If we create a perfect handover between our side and the advertiser side in the moment where we improve and where we optimize the funnel as a whole and not only one or the other side, that was always our philosophy and nowadays we invest even more into go -- to go into conversations with them and to create at a local optimum on each side, but a global optimum together.\nAlaxandar Wang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. And just one more quick follow up. I know in your prepared remarks, you talked about expecting to see more stability in QR and RPQR drivers going forward. You know, we've had to, obviously, given a variety of developments, deal with a lot of comps over the last couple of years. But as you start to invest in advertising in the second half of this year, maybe if you can just talk about conceptually how we should kind of frame the development of QR versus RPQR for revenue drivers going forward.\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. So in Q3, you will still see some comp effect because there are some product optimizations that started to kick in end of Q3, in Q4. But as of Q4, I would expect the QR, RPQR trend to be more in line with the historic trends, with a slight shift structurally toward RPQR coming out of continuous product optimizations. So when we said in the past, base assumption per region is RPQR to be flat. We would now expect RPQR to be slightly up, so low-single digits year-over-year once we've lapped the comp effects.\nAlaxandar Wang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThanks, Axel.\nOperator\nThank you very much indeed. Now from Susquehanna, your next question comes from the line of Shyam Patil, and your line is now open sir.\nRyan -- Susquehanna -- Analyst\nHey guys. It's Ryan on for Shyam. Just two quick ones if I could. So first, how should we be thinking about the cadence of ad spend and return on ad spend throughout 2019? And then secondly, could you just give us a quick update on your strategy with regards to Google Hotel Finder? Thanks.\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nSo on the advertising spend cadence, as I said, we expect the advertising spend to be down year-over-year in the second quarter and start to increase in the third quarter and also be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We don't give any specific guidance on the return on advertisement spend, but we also expect the revenue to be down in Q2 and up in Q3 and Q4.\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nCould you just repeat the second part of your question because I couldn't hear it correctly?\nRyan -- Susquehanna -- Analyst\nYeah. Just -- I was just asking for a quick update on your strategy with regards to Google Hotel Finder.\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So as Axel said before, we are now live on most of our markets, so we ramped up significantly the number of markets beginning of the year. And -- but still we have not leveraged all of our inventory, all of our price inventory right now. So we think that we are currently under invested in the Google Hotel Ads channel and we think that we will be able to have a catch up over this year to reach a level, which is in relation to the overall market share of CHA compared to non-branded FAM.\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nI think we can move to the next question.\nOperator\nThank you very much indeed. And from J.P. Morgan, you now have a question from the line of Doug Anmuth, and your line is open sir.\nDouglas Anmuth -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask, you talked about for EBITDA being toward the high-end for the year and there were some growth opportunities that you could invest in more. Can you give us a sense of what you're thinking about there, what those opportunities are and where you could be focused?\nAnd then secondly, just given kind of revenue declining less in 2Q than 1Q, you talked about some of the improvements as you lap in the back half of the year, was there any commentary around full year revenue growth? Thank you.\nAxel Hefer -- Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer\nYes, so let me start with your second question. We don't guide revenue for the full year. On your first question, opportunities to invest. We are running marketing across various channels in 155 platforms covering roughly 70 markets and we continuously obviously assess whether there are additional investment opportunities where we got -- get good marginal return for investment. And with the comment that we made, I want to say that, with a good start into the year, we believe that we have the financial flexibility to invest into opportunities when they might arise, predominantly marketing driven and that will support our revenue trajectory, particularly in the second half of the year.\nDouglas Anmuth -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nThank you, Axel.\nOperator\nThank you very much indeed. Thank you. And there appear to be no further questions at this time.\nElie Matta -- Head of Corporate Development\nSo at this time, I would like to hand it over back to Rolf for some closing remarks.\nRolf Schromgens -- Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So thanks a lot for participating in our Q1 2019 earnings call. As I mentioned before, we are very pleased with the start of the year. We were able to turn around profitability from a record adjusted EBITDA loss of EUR21.9 million to a record profit of EUR20.9 million. We made significant progress in many areas in continuing our path to optimize our product for retention and improving cooperation with our advertisers.
