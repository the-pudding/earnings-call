Thank you, everyone, for participating in today's earnings call. I'm pleased to deliver today's opening remarks on behalf of Mr. Chen.\n2018 was an exciting year for Bilibili, as we made great strides across our business. In March, we successfully completed our IPO and throughout the year, we continue to build on that success and grow each of our core divisions. We added massive amounts of new diverse content through our robust Professional User Generated Video or PUGV ecosystem, as well as entered a number of new co-operation agreement.\nOur ever-growing content supports our expanding community. By the end of the year, our MAUs grows to record level of 92.8 million. Importantly, we deepened the level of connectivity within our community and enhanced our monetization capabilities.\nBy the end of 2018, we had increased our revenue by 67% to RMB4.1 billion and the number of paying users contribute from 1.1 million to 4.4 million in the last 12 months. The fourth quarter was an extension of this momentum and the total net revenue increased 57% year-over-year to RMB1.2 billion, once again surpassing our expectations and beating the high-end of our guidance. During the fourth quarter, we further grow our robust compilation of high-quality content through our PUGVs. As we announced during the quarter, we entered the strategic agreement with market giants Tencent and Alibaba, which considerably strengthened our capacity in anime, mobile games and commercialization.\nOur extensive and growing library of content continues to attract young people to our community, generating substantial user growth. In the fourth quarter, the number of monthly active users grow by 29% year-over-year, reaching 92.8 million. Our mobile monthly active users grow even faster by 37% year-over-year to 79.5 million in the fourth quarter.\nOur platform's exceptional user growth and increase engagement levels are the testament to our unparalleled community. In the fourth quarter, our users spend a daily average of 78 minutes on our platform, excluding time spent playing our mobile games. This is up five minutes compared to the same period last year, while increasingly large number of new users also joined our platform. In 2018, the most popular content verticals were entertainment, lifestyle, games, anime and technology.\nWithin our massive user base, we have a unit core user group or official member, they pry themselves on passing our community entrance exam and exhibit much more loyal and engaged user behavior compared to non-official members. They are also considerably more inclined to pay for Bilibili premium content and their 12 months retention rate is over 80%. By the end of 2018, our official members once again outpace our MAU growth, increasing by 44% year-over-year to 45 million.\nThrough our entertainment ecosystem, our video content creations continue to be dominated by PUGV. Looking at the fourth quarter, specifically, approximately 89% of our viewed videos came from PUGVs. Finding ways to support this important constituency was one of our primary goals in 2018. Today, our submission progress has been more streamlined with technical updates, our mobile content submission and streaming.\nOur cash incentive program has over 100,000 enrollment, further activating and encouraging continued content creation. In the fourth quarter, we had on average of 570,000 active content creators uploading 1.7 million videos monthly, up 143% and 148%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. In addition, we hosted Bilibili Top 100 Content Creators Award Ceremony in January 2019, where we celebrated outstanding achievement of leading content creators in various categories. We will continue to improve our platform design competencies and expand our commercialization capabilities to help our content creators shine even brighter.\nIn addition to our diverse PUGVs, our premium-licensed content anime, variety shows and documentaries continue to thrill our community. As we further our leadership in overseas anime offerings, we are also expanding our footprint in domestic anime. In December, we hosted a Made by Bilibili press conference, where we released over 20 Bilibili produced domestic animation shows. Furthermore, our self-produced variety show, Storyman 2, and annual Bilibili New Year Gala granted (ph) instant success among the youngster generations following their releases.\nBuilding partnerships with market leaders was also one of the important ways we extended our content offerings and improved our commercialization capabilities. In early October, we announced Tencent's equity investment of $370 million, and our subsequent partnership. And our agreement, both Bilibili and Tencent will exchange co-produced and jointly invest in anime content, as well as expand our partnership in mobile games operations. As of the end of February 2019, we have already exchanged a number of domestic animation copyrights and more are planned for the rest of the year. We are also jointly working on certain new anime-related projects aiming to deliver more high-quality content to anime lovers.\nFurthermore, in December 2018, we entered into a partnership with Taobao, China's largest mobile commerce destination and Alibaba for content-driven e-commerce and commercialization of Bilibili's IP assets. Leveraging Taobao's gigantic platform and expertise in e-commerce, we expected to further help our content creators to realize and improve their commercial values, while building a more virtual content community and commercialization focused ecosystem. We are working closely with Taobao and in the coming months, we expect to introduce the first branch of top content creators to promote merchandise on both platforms.\nOur figure (ph) remains on the first of the online entertainment industry, particularly through our core Generation Z demographic and their continued enthusiasm for ACG content. In November, we considerably strengthened our fundamental competence in ACG with the launch of our new Bilibili Comic app, rounding out our offerings and fortifying our position as a leader in ACG. We are rapidly accumulating exciting comic content. In December, we also acquired assets from NetEase Comics division to further build our complementary suite for premium-licensed content. We will continue to invest in ACG content to satisfy the growing demand for our eager community.\nAs we discussed in the past, technology is the cornerstone of our business, we continue to improve our product design and AI power to connect users and grow our community. Over 70% of our video views are now generated by our smart recommendation system and over one-third of MAUs visited Bilibili Moments, a social interactive function that allows users to interact and engage with content creators and like-minded friends in the community. Based on these functionalities and improved recommendation powers, our users are building deeper connections and engaging more with the platform and each other than ever before.\nIn the fourth quarter, we saw exciting participation levels with 476 million daily view and 1 billion monthly interactions through bullet-chats, comments, likes, and the Bilibili Moments posts, up 107% and 298% year-over-year, respectively. These unique inductions are central to our success and the one of the ways that we continue to build our loyal offerings.\nWith that overview on content community, I'd like to take a few moments to review our commercialization progress. Revenues from mobile games grow 50% year-over-year to RMB713 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, or $104 million led primarily by Fate/Grand Order or FGO. The game pervasive popularity continues throughout the fourth quarter. And the users responded quite favorably to the release of the major content update FGO Chapter 2.0 around 2019 Chinese New Year. Additionally, we released new titles, including Son of the Time (ph) in November, an exciting ACG-themed RPG based on well-known IP, which has been gaining popularity among core users.\nFor our jointly operating games, in the fourth quarter, we published several titles, including Naruto Online from Tencent and Knives Post Survival from NetEase, both of which were well received by our users. Looking at our pipeline, besides those titles we had previously announced, we have added a number of new games to our release lineup. On exclusive licensed game front, we have Final Gear, a highly anticipated astral RPG set against a doomsday backdrop. We were also jointly operating two (inaudible) ACG-themed mobile games, RWBY and Ark games. These three games have already obtained regulatory approvals and scheduled for launch on Bilibili's platform in the second quarter.\nTurning to our advertising business. Revenue from advertising increased by over 300% to RMB160 million, or $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our two growth engines, brand advertising and performance-based advertising gained considerable momentum throughout the year. We are actively improving our advertising efficiencies, while expanding the number of advertisers in different industry verticals. The top three industry verticals for brand advertising in the fourth quarter were games, e-commerce and Internet services. And the top three verticals for performance-based advertising were e-commerce, education and games.\nOur live broadcasting and the VAS revenues increased by 276% year-over-year to RMB202 million, or $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, with contribution from both our live broadcasting business and the premium memberships. In 2018, we started a number of initiatives to expand our live broadcasting content, including growing the number of high-quality e-sports matches to catch our highly concentrated base of game lovers. These include top matches in League of Legends and Overwatch League Championships, the result was encouraging. We recorded peak live streaming page views during the LPL S8 final game, which reached the top industry levels. We have also improved product design and the user experience, attracting more live streaming viewers and improving our monetization efficiency. In the fourth quarter, live broadcasting paying users grow over 200%, compared to the same period last year.\nIn January 2018, we launched a premium membership program allowing paying members to enjoy exclusive or advanced license content. The program was an immediate hit in the community and attract millions of subscriptions. By the end of December, we have recorded 3.6 million valid premium members, demonstrating our user high willingness to pay for premium content and Bilibili's heightened monetization potential.\nLast but not least, we are delighted to share our e-commerce and other revenue segment, reaching RMB81 million or $11.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 254% from the same period of last year. Largely, thanks to the increase in sales of products through our e-commerce platform. We are optimistic about the potential of this business, with the growing demand for ACG-related products for our users.\nAs we move through 2019, we will continue to strategically grow our business by adding best-in-class content to our industry-leading platform and further increase the bond within our dynamic community, driven by the inquisitive mind of the Generation Z population.\nThis concludes Mr. Chen's remarks. I will now provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter 2018 and the full year financial results.\nDuring the fourth quarter, each our premium business lines continued to grow. Our total net revenue increased by 57% year-over-year to RMB1.2 billion, or $168 million. We further improved our revenue structure with increased gains from advertising and live broadcasting segments, as well as our value-added services business. Our non-game revenues accounted for 38% of total revenues in the fourth quarter, up from 31% in the third quarter and 16% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAs we execute our commercialization strategy, the number of paying users nearly quadrupled in 2018 versus 2017, reaching 4.4 million in the fourth quarter, demonstrating our heightened monetization potential.

The increase was primarily due to increased general and administrative personnel-related expenses and increased other miscellaneous expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were RMB153 million, or $22 million, representing a 76% increase year-over-year.

The increase was primarily due to the gain arising from the revaluation of our previously held equity interest in one of our investees when we obtaining control over it over -- during the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by the impairment loss charge for other investees.\nNet loss totaled RMB191 million, or $28 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with RMB51 million in the same period of 2017.\nAdjusted net loss, which mainly exclude share-based compensation expenses and amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, was RMB152 million, or $22 million from RMB25 million in the prior year.\nBasic and diluted loss per share were RMB0.59.

We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, please go ahead.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you so much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Thomas Chong from Credit Suisse. Thomas, your line is now open.\nThomas Chong -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\n(Foreign Language) Thanks management for taking my questions and congratulations on a strong set of result. I have two questions. My first question is about our e-commerce strategy, we have -- our co-operation with Taobao. Can management talk about more details about how we should think about this business line in 2019? And any financial implications to the top line and the bottom line?\nAnd my second question is about our user growth. Given our strong user growth for this quarter, can management share our thoughts in 2019 and 2020? Thank you.\nRui Chen -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n(Foreign Language) Thank you, Thomas, for your question. I will translate Mr. Chen's answer. The co-operation with Taobao we announced in December last year. The co-operation mainly include content-driven e-commerce business and commercialization of Bilibili's intellectual IP assets.\n(Foreign Language) For example, two Bilibili content creators will register and operate a number of accounts on Taobao and promote merchandise by producing content, creative and interactive format on both platforms in a way to increase their commercial values.\n(Foreign Language) As for the Bilibili's IP assets, we'll connect both the front and the back-end of the database and to improve our commercialization of our IP assets.\n(Foreign Language) And Taobao will provide Bilibili with e-commerce technical support to ensure a smooth and more efficient user experience.\n(Foreign Language) Currently our collaboration with Taobao, with regarding the content creators are progressing very smoothly.\n(Foreign Language) We are actually in a process of introducing our first batch of content creator, who has over 1 million followers to set up -- to be set up in Taobao.\n(Foreign Language) The collaboration between Bilibili and Taobao is more of a union of two ecosystem, the Bilibili's content ecosystem, as well as Taobao's commercial system. As the two ecosystem united, we see a lot of synergy and commercialization opportunities.\n(Foreign Language) In the future, there will be multiple ways for us to work together, that includes advertising opportunity related to e-commerce and for our content creators to better monetize their traffic.\n(Foreign Language)\nJuliet Yang -- Senior Director of Investor Relations\n(Foreign Language)\nRui Chen -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n(Foreign Language) So, Thomas, with regarding the user expansion plan, Mr. Chen has discussed in the past, in 2019, our user goal is to reach a peak MAU around 110 million to 120 million and to reach 140 million to 150 million in 2020. Currently, we are well on track to deliver that goal.\nThomas Chong -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you so much.\nJuliet Yang -- Senior Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, Thomas.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from J.P. Morgan. Alex, you may now ask your question.\nAlex Yao -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\n(Foreign Language) So my first question is to follow-up Thomas question on the partnership with Alibaba. Given the Alibaba partnership, how should we think about your revenue mix change over the next two years to three years?\nThen the second question is on the user acquisition cost to achieve our target of 2019 MAU. To be able to achieve that target, what's your user acquisition strategy and how should we think about your sales and marketing budget over the coming quarters? Thank you.\nRui Chen -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n(Foreign Language) In the past we have made revenue structure forecasts, from a three-year horizon, we projected by then we'll have about a 50-50 revenue split, 50% games and 50% non-games. Based on our current business plans, this goal is still on track.\n(Foreign Language) Okay. Mr. Chen added, as he mentioned earlier, that the collaboration with Taobao is beyond just on the revenue lines. It's more of a union of two ecosystem. This will definitely help on our commercial advertising business, which will help us to grow faster and more healthier. More importantly, they will also help us to build a stronger ecosystem with our content creators to better connect the user, the content and the merchandise in a way it's form a fundamental baseline to reinforce our powers to generate revenue more healthily.\n(Foreign Language) Okay. So the core competency in our commercial ability, one is to grow in a healthy way. Second is more sustainable way. It probably won't immediately show on the P&L, but will help us, not only not hurting our user experience, but finding and providing more right content and right consumption products to our users and to help us to grow in a longer run.\n(Foreign Language) As for the sustainability, we think our revenue growth will be very healthy, a longer-term sustainable growth.\n(Foreign Language)\nJuliet Yang -- Senior Director of Investor Relations\nOkay.\nNi Li -- Vice Chairman of the Board and Chief Operating Officer\n(Foreign Language) So the fourth quarter user growth, as well as the full year user growth is in line with our initial projections.\n(Foreign Language) The key driving force of that user growth is mainly driven by our content, specifically in PUGV and our OGV content, as well as the stickiness and engagement level of our community.\n(Foreign Language) At the same time, based on our experience and advantage of our content offering, we'll also actively try to attract users from outside of our community to come to Bilibili.\n(Foreign Language) In 2018, our user acquisition strategy has gained a very deep experience in terms of evaluate the quality of the new user in terms of level of engagement and level of retention.\n(Foreign Language) So based on our internal analysis, we see the new user who come in, in 2018, their conversion to registered user and their conversion to paying user, the level is much higher compared to the same period last -- in 2017.\n(Foreign Language) That results prove -- is a proven -- is a proof -- strong improvement of our 2018 user acquisition strategy. Looking into 2019, we'll continue to focus on the quality of new user and focus on the key metrics, such as their engagement level, their conversion to paying users and to improve our user acquisition policy.\n(Foreign Language) So, all in all, in 2018, we'll considerably add some budget in apps -- in terms of absolute dollar amount in user acquisition.\nXin Fan -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Let me have some input for that. Actually, there was three cost component being outside marketing expenses, that's the promotion expenses for our online game and the cost of -- to acquire the new users, as well as the personnel cost related to our commercial sales person -- sales team person. So, as we mentioned that, there will be more games to be releasing this year, and we will enlarge our investment in the user acquisition. We forecast that overall the selling expenses will come in around 50% of the total revenues. But that number will be -- the percentage will vary through different kind of quarters, like in Q1 and Q3 there will be higher percentage, in Q2 and Q4 there will be a little bit lower.\nOperator\nThank you so much. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Alex, your line is now open.\nAlex Poon -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n(Foreign Language) I'll translate my questions. My first question is regarding MAU growth. Could you give us some more color on where these new users will come from, whether they are students or non-students or comes from higher-tier city, lower-tier cities, age demographics, whether they are game streaming users or they are -- they watch (inaudible) and they don't watch (inaudible) anymore or they come from Taobao because of that new partnership?\nMy second question is regarding gross margin improvement in the next few years. Assuming fourth quarter -- assuming the revenue mix is already 50-50 between games and non-games, what the gross margin would be today? And for most of the business segments you have a quite high revenue share for games, advertising and live streaming. And in the next two years, three years, what are the plans to increase the gross margin of each of these businesses? Thank you very much.\nRui Chen -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n(Foreign Language) So the driving force of our user growth is through content. We use content to attract users and use our community to retain users. We do not solely rely on pure traffic acquisition.\n(Foreign Language) So we have been relying on this model for the past years and we'll be relying on this model in the futures that the key reason behind our user growth is, we are a content-driven business model. As we expand our content categories and improve our content qualities, we will be attracting more and more users who are interested in those categories. And because our strong community features that our all users are -- has much higher retention level compared to other platforms. That's why we are able to continue to grow in the future.\n(Foreign Language) So, I think for the young generations in China, their demand for content will only grow stronger and their demand for the quality of content is another way of consumption upgrade.\n(Foreign Language) So that's why more and more young people will become our users.\n(Foreign Language) So, based on the second half of 2018 new user profile analysis, we see both first and second tier city, as well as third and fourth tier, fifth tier city, they are both growing.\n(Foreign Language) The user who are coming from third tier and below are growing faster than the first and second tier city.\n(Foreign Language) We think this trend will continue in the next few years.\nXin Fan -- Chief Financial Officer\nOkay. Let me take the question about the gross profit margin. Actually, if you look at the revenue-sharing cost that we already disclosed, in Q4, that number is around 78% of the revenues. So that means that we don't pay too much to those kind of users for their individual business segment like games. Actually, for exclusive games, the gross profit margin is quite stable, like 55% for exclusive game license. Therefore, the whole operation model, the -- we don't share any of it to third parties, so that means the GP margin will be around 100%.\nAnd for the live broadcasting, currently the gross profit is not that high, but actually if you count the -- our subscription membership revenues, the overall margin is still reasonable. So, we will not like to calculate gross profit margin in like just look at one quarter or two quarters numbers. We will keep invest in our Comic business, so that will -- well will incur more content cost for our Comics and we will also invest in different areas like virtual idol, Luo Tianyi, that will help us to grow our communities.\nSo in the short-term like one or two quarters, the gross profit margin may be have that fluctuations, you already saw that in Q3 and Q4. Also, there might be some pressure in Q1, but in the long run, I think the investment for today is to have their value to help us to achieve more stabilized sales mix. At that time, we foresee that when normalized our gross profit margin, where we have 50% revenue from games and 30% from advertising, and 20% from VAS, that means the gross profit margin will be around 40%. That's our projection.\nOperator\nThank you so much. And our last question comes from the line of Hillman Chan from Citi. Hillman, your line is now open.\nHillman Chan -- Citigroup -- Analyst\n(Foreign Language) So my first question is about our content strategy. As we are getting more and more diverse in terms of the content offering, could management share more on our focuses and plans for particular content show in 2019 to attract more new users? And related to that, how should we think about the impact to Bilibili brand and the potential impact to the core ACG user loyalty? And related to the content investment budget, could management share more on that for 2019? How should we think about the timeline of turning around the business?\nAnd then my second question is on the game. Could management share more on the pipeline, the timelines, as well as the game approval process update? Thank you.\nRui Chen -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n(Foreign Language) I will divide our content, our platform into two brackets. One is the core ACG-related content, including anime, comics and games. And the second part is more general entertainment-related content that includes lifestyle and entertainment, pop culture, celebrity-related.\n(Foreign Language) Okay. So first of all, in the core ACG content, target users, they themselves are growing bigger and bigger. That includes, for example, for the domestic animations, we have more and more viewers, who will -- who are interested in domestic animations and more and more users are starting to accept and grow fond of VTubers. And e-sports, nevertheless to say has become countrywide sensation.\n(Foreign Language) We have a core competency in terms of ACG content, and in the near future we'll continue to invest and keep our leadership position in this content category.\n(Foreign Language) So, as for the more general entertainment content, we are -- we actually offer a very wide array category of content, that can also be seen from the data as we show to our investors, the number of video views -- in terms of video views, entertainment content ranked number one.\n(Foreign Language) For example, there are a lot of traditional Chinese type of music are getting more and more popularity, a lot of digital product review sessions are now available and gaining popularity as well. And we are also seeing a vlog as a important content category that's attracting more and more users.\n(Foreign Language) So, from all those content mentioned above, they have one thing in common that is all of those fans, they follow those content based on their own interests and habits, and they love those high-quality content produced by our content creators. They also have established strong emotional bond and connection with those content creators.\n(Foreign Language) So in terms of different content categories within our community, we have one practice, which is we put the content quality at top priority.
