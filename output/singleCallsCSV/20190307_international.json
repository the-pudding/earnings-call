At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jim Hurley, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nJames Hurley -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nThank you. Thank you for joining us on IGT's fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call, which is hosted by Marco Sala, our Chief Executive Officer, and Alberto Fornaro, our Chief Financial Officer. After we make some introductory remarks, we'll open the call for your comments.\nDuring today's call, we'll be making some forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.\nAnd now, I'll turn the call over to Marco Sala.\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Jim, and good day, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting fourth quarter and full year results that are in line with the improved outlook we provided last October. On a currency-adjusted basis, we reached the top end of our initial full year EBITDA guidance. We delivered mid-single-digit EBITDA growth on stable revenue in 2018, at constant currency and scope. Our profits also benefited from overall operating expenses discipline, particularly the optimization of R&D.\nGlobal Lottery performance was strong and Italy was resilient, despite increased pressure on the sector. In addition, we achieved a nice recovery in our North American Gaming segment. The International segment did not meet our expectation for the year based on its fourth quarter results.\nThanks to the recurring nature of most of our revenue base and the diversity of products and geographies, we met our financial objectives, despite some incremental headwinds during the year. These included the foreign exchange, higher taxes on Italy gaming machines and shifts in timing of certain product sales. Of course, we also had some unexpected benefits from elevated North American jackpot activity.\nAs I mentioned, our global lottery results were impressive in 2018. Total lottery same-store revenues, outside of Italy, rose nearly 8%, reflecting 5% growth in instant and draw-based games and nearly 30% increase in Multistate Jackpot games. North America Lottery performance was especially robust, with same-store revenues up 9% in the year, supported by October's $1.5 billion Mega Million jackpot.\nDraw-based and instant ticket games also performed well, with same-store revenues up 5%. Many of the jurisdictions with the highest annual per capita lottery spending, including Florida, Michigan and New Jersey, generated strong increases confirming the long-term vitality of the business. With the current revenue weighted average contract duration of eight years, including extension in North America, we have significant visibility and a stable base to grow from.\nInternational lottery same-store revenues rose 3% in 2018, led by the EMEA region. A recovery in the UK lottery wagers was an important contributor to growth, thanks to the new scratch cards and instant win games. We also had good results in the Czech Republic and benefited from the continued success of the EuroMillions game.\nItaly lottery results were very good in 2018, a true testament to innovation driving growth. Lotto wagers were up 7%, led by 11% growth for 10eLotto and the incremental contribution from the new MillionDAY game. We also achieved a 2% increase in Scratch & Win wagers, the second consecutive year of growth on the successful relaunch of the Miliardario and the Multipliers games. Innovation is the most important driver of lottery growth. We are constantly developing ways to drive industry expansion and reach a new generation of players. These efforts have earned IGT, the International Gaming Awards Lottery Product of the Year for two years in a row.\nIn Gaming, full year results were mixed. Total Gaming revenues were stable with the prior year on an underlining (ph) basis. Encouraging progress in North America and stability in Italy were offset by lower International revenue. Global shipments of gaming machines rose slightly in 2018. In North America, total replacement units were up more than 6% as we are completing a full refresh of our hardware and bringing these cabinets to market with better-performing games.\nScarab, Solar Disc, Mistress of Egypt, and Ocean Magic Grand were among the most popular titles that we sold and are currently recognized as some of the best-performing games in the market. As a result, we have successfully upgraded our standing in the core video market. This is evident in the record number of replacement unit shipment in North America in the fourth quarter, including a more than 20% increase to casino customers. Demand for our Crystal series cabinet and new game content also drove higher ASPs for the fourth quarter and full year periods.\nBy contrast, International Gaming machine shipments were down for the fourth quarter and full year. This is largely due to market dynamics in Argentina and Peru, and to lower replacement demand in certain European markets against robust unit sales in 2017. This being said, it is worth mentioning that we are making headway in some important strategic markets like Australia and in Eastern Europe. In Australia, for example, our gaming machine unit sales were up more than 25% in the year. The CrystalCurve and Crystal 27 cabinets are driving this growth, particularly with successful new games Star Stax and Fortune Gong. We'll build on Star Stax's success in Australia by introducing it to additional international markets.\nThe recovery in the North America installed base during 2018 was achieved by executing on our main strategies. We reinforced the Wheel of Fortune franchise with new hardware and games. We increased our commitment to multi-level progressive games. Going forward, we intend to leverage more of our achievements in core video reel games by integrating the most impactful test banking sites and game mechanics into the premium portfolio.\nThe International installed base declined in 2018, due a -- due to a larger South Africa conversion sales in the first quarter, partially offset by higher Greece VLTs. We are seeing good improvement in productivity in Greece related to the successful introduction of new fruit games in the second half of 2018. We expect to add more than 1,000 Greece VLTs in 2019.\nIn Italy, the installed base of gaming machines was significantly lower on the government-mandated reduction in AWPs that was largely completed in the first half of 2018. Despite the unit reduction and the impact of higher taxes, total gaming machines' wagers were modestly above the prior year. We managed these by improving productivity of the remaining AWP fleet and the VLTs.\nFor many of you, new government restrictions imposed on the Italian gaming sector have been frustrating. I think it is important to stay grounded in the fact that player demand across all gaming verticals remains quite solid, confirming the resilience of the market. The Italy team has done a great a job, managing through these challenges over the past few years and delivered higher profit in 2018.\nWe won several high profile central casino management system contracts in 2018 around the world. While the industry pipeline of new casino openings is not as strong as in 2019, we do have important new advantage installations planned for the year. There is also considerable opportunity for us to leverage innovative add-on system products such as Cardless Connect, Resort Wallet and intelligent offer with our existing customers.\nIt was a year of important progress for the North American Sports Betting business. To date IGT's Sports Betting platform is operational in all jurisdictions that are live, 24 land-based locations across five states and mobile in three states. We also established important strategic partnership with FanDuel and William Hill. The QuickBet kiosks and the Crystal betting terminals, we launched at G2E, are in the regulatory certification process. We recently received approval for the QuickBet kiosk in New Jersey and have just begun rolling them out.\nIGT is well positioned to continue to provide technology and services for commercial casinos, Tribal Casino or lotteries plus betting operators across retail, digital and mobile channels. As we look to 2019, we expect to see continued underlining growth in our core lottery and gaming business. There are some specific items to consider when comparing the P&L to 2018, but the underlining business is expected to grow.\nOver the last four years, we have established a solid foundation to build from securing large, long-term lottery contracts, stabilizing the North American Gaming business and investing in new growth opportunities like Sports Betting. All of that should result in a meaningful improvement in free cash flow starting in 2019.\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Alberto.\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Marco, and hello to all of you on the call today. On Slide 8, we summarize the full year results.\nRevenue was stable with the prior year at constant currency and scope, which reflects the sale of Double Down. This was achieved despite the reclassification of $73 million of jackpot expense as a contra-revenue item under ASC 606. Underlying core business improvement in North America for both Gaming and Lottery, and strength in Italy, offset the lower International revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1.74 billion, and 4% higher than the prior year and within the updated October outlook after normalizing for foreign exchange. Adjusted operating income was below the prior year due to the higher depreciation associated with the long-term Lottery contract wins and extension, as well as increased investment in the Gaming installed base.\nOur fourth quarter financial results are summarized on Slide 9. Consolidated revenue increased (ph) 4% at constant currency. Gaming and Lottery revenue was stable, with the decline coming from certain Sports Betting dynamics in the prior year, including an exceptional low payout in Italy and large International product sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA was down 6% at constant currency, primarily due to lower revenues. Additionally, higher SG&A in the fourth quarter was partly a result of some timing difference in various expense accruals between the two years and partly higher bad debt, legal and other personnel costs for 2018. The higher SG&A is not reflective of a structural increase in operating costs and partly reflects a higher seasonal increase. Once again, adjusted operating income includes higher depreciation from recent lottery wins as well as the upgrading of our global gaming machine installed base.\nLet's turn now to our operating segments. North American Gaming and Interactive is shown on Slide 10. Adjusted for jackpot expense reclass, revenue rose 3%. Product sales were up double digits, thanks to 27% increase in gaming machine unit shipments, coupled with higher ASPs. In fact, ASPs in the fourth quarter were the highest since 2015. Customer demand for our field tested products such as Scarab, Temple of Fire, Ocean Magic, Solar Disc and Mistress of Egypt is driving these results.\nNet of the jackpot expense reclass, service revenue was relatively stable. The year-over-year increase in the installed base was offset by lower yields to -- due to a shift in the overall mix of jurisdictions and machines. The decline in operating income is entirely due to depreciation. This includes depreciation of new cabinets we are installing as well as accelerated depreciation on older units. Additionally in the prior year, we had a significant contribution from high-margin IP revenues.\nSlide 11 shows the results of North American Lottery segment. The fundamental of this business are very sound. Same-store revenue was up over 20% in the quarter, driven by October, $1.5 billion Mega Millions jackpot, the second largest Multistate Jackpots ever. Same-store revenues from instant ticket and draw games was also good, up 5% in the quarter primarily on the success of high price point instant ticket at larger customers like Texas and Michigan.\nThe decline in product sales is related to higher lottery terminal sales and a large Canadian VLT central system in the prior year. Product sales in the North America Lottery business are highly variable and represent as more percentage of annual revenues for this segment. The 21% increase in operating income reflects the stronger profit flow through, more robust same-store revenues that was partially offset by higher depreciation associated with recent contract wins and extensions.\nNow let's turn to the International segment on Slide 12. While the results of this segment were below our expectation, it is worth noting that the quarterly cadence of revenue and profit differ greatly in '18 versus 2017. We delivered much stronger international results in the first nine months of 2018, assisted by the shift in timing of the Finland contract from Q4 to Q3. As previously said, we also saw a timing shift from Q4 to 2019 of a very large VLT project in Sweden.\n2017 was very back-end loaded with the concentration of both product sales and contract milestone-driven service revenue as well as operating expense benefit in the fourth quarter. Altogether, these dynamics contributed to a very significant change in the year-to-year comparison for the fourth quarter. In Lottery same-store revenue grew by over 4%, driven by contribution from instant ticket, draw-based games and jackpot games. These underlying core growth in the business was overshadowed by the prior year benefits associated with the contract milestone-driven service revenue, I just mentioned.\nGaming service revenue was down for the same reason. The decline in the store base reflects a nearly 1,500 units conversion sale in South Africa, partially offset by growth in Greece VLT units.\nTurning to product sales, we shipped fewer units to Europe and Latin America where challenging foreign exchange rates as well as gaming taxes in Argentina and Peru impacted customer spending. This was partly mitigated by the South Africa conversion sales where the units reached the end of their -- almost the end of their contract. Excluding this sale, ASP was up sharply in the period.\nOperating income reflects decreased revenue and the high-margin mix of items in the prior year, as well as the differential timing of certain operating expenses across periods. The $119 million impairment charges we recorded in the quarter was primarily a reduction of the carrying amount of goodwill in our International segment. Our underlying outlook for International has not changed and our expectation for growth remain about the same as before, but we are starting from a lower base with the 2018 results and these coupled with other factor, including higher weighted average cost of capital impacted the goodwill calculation.\nItaly is here on the Slide 13. Results continue to be strong in Italy with fundamentals continue to improve across all our -- all core businesses. In Lottery, we continue to see strength in 10eLotto wagers, which rose by 8%, Scratch & Win wagers were up 2% primarily driven by a relaunch of the Multiplier family. In Machine Gaming overall wager increased once again due to strong productivity gains from both AWP and VLT machines. This helped to mitigate the impact of mandatory reduction in the number of (ph) AWP higher gaming machine taxes and certain regional restrictions. The decline in Sports Betting revenue is exclusively due to the comparison with the unusually low payout in 2017. Wager for their part were stable and the payout realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 is indicative of a more normalized level. Operating income reflects broad-based wager growth, with high profile flow through, partially offset by the differential Sports Betting payout and increased taxes on gaming machines.\nOur debt and leverage profile is included on Slide 14. Leverage include -- increased to 4.47 times. This was primarily due to the net $559 million in upfront payments for the Italy Scratch & Win license that were paid during the year. Cash flow for the full year is shown here on Slide 15. Cash from operation totaled $30 million, including $878 million in gross upfront payment related to the Italian Scratch & Win license. The final installment of the upfront payment related to this license was made in October 2018. As a reminder, we have secured Scratch & Win to September -- through September 2028, and there are no significant capital demands for this license until the next tender.\nCapEx was $533 million, coming in lower-than-expected range, $575 million to $625 million. Gross dividend and return of capital payments to minority partners, totaling $212 million were offset by $322 million in partner contribution to fund the Scratch & Win upfront payments.\nOur initial outlook for 2019 is included here on Slide 16. We currently expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.70 billion to 1.76 billion for the full year period at the euro/dollar rate to 1.15. Our outlook assumes underlying growth for the core Lottery and Gaming business. As you are aware, there are several dynamics that impact comparison with our 2018 results. This represents over $100 million in headwinds that are included in our 2019 outlook.\nFX is worth about $25 million. The impact of the new Italy gaming taxes is approximately $40 million. The large Mega Million jackpot in the fourth quarter of 2018 provided $20 million in incremental EBITDA that we do not plan to recur.\nThe balance is the loss of the Illinois supply contract. At constant currency, EBITDA will likely be slightly below the prior year in the first half and up in the second half. Along those lines, EBITDA should be a little bit more concentrated in the second half of the year. This reflected the timing of certain product sales, including the 4,000 Sweden VLT, which are now planned for the second half. We will work to change this profile as we did in 2018, but this is our best estimate at this time.\nCapital expenditure is expected to be $450 -- between $450 million and $550 million, with maintenance CapEx of $400 million to $500 million and growth CapEx of approximately $50 million. In terms of timing, we expect approximately 60% of the CapEx to occur in the first half of the year. The RFP for the Brazilian instant ticket and Italy SuperEnalotto tenders are active. Our current outlook does not include the additional investment that would be required, if we secure either or both of these opportunities.\nSo to summarize, 2018 was a year of continued global strengths in lottery, resilience in Italy and stabilization in the North American business. We achieved our objective despite (inaudible) that we have not anticipated when we set them. With no major upfront payments ahead of us, we expect to return to significant free cash flow generation in 2019.\nAt this point, we'd like to open the call for questions.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nInternational Game Technology PLC (IGT) Q1 2019 Earnings Call Transcript\n\n\nWhy International Game Technology's Shares Plunged 14% Today\n\n\nThese Two Gaming Stocks Have Plunged At Least 44% in 2018\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nHey, guys. Good morning. If I could start, maybe Alberto, if you could maybe think about like we go back to the end of October, you guys obviously took your guidance range up to the $1.74 billion to $1.80 billion range and it obviously provided an implication for the fourth quarter, which you came in slightly below the low end of. I know you talked about it a little bit, but if you could just kind of highlight the one to two things that may be really deferred from what your expectations were at that time, I think it would be helpful?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nCarlo, I would say that there are two main reasons. The most important one is, as I mentioned, the performance in International, we were expecting higher product sales, and particularly in Latin America and the EMEA region. They are a little bit short of our expectation. The added -- compared to what we said in the prior call, the SG&A abnormally higher in Q4, but this time, we're a little bit higher for a series of circumstances that are related to some accrual that we did it at the end of -- right at the end of the quarter, and we didn't factor, because we're -- they were not forecasted simply at that time.\nThey were related to some accrual that we did in the last part of the quarter, but that was slightly higher than that. And then, in general, we achieved in terms of net debt a better results than what we expected that increase the management variable compensation, as well as we had a one-off at year-end in the overall personnel cost. So these are the two major items that were unforeseen and that are reflected in the current outlook compared to our conversation we had in November.\nCarlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then just, obviously with the new guidance that you guys have put forth for 2019, you talked a little bit about some of your CapEx. I just wanted to kind of confirm that the Analyst Day targets that you guys laid out with respect to your annual free cash flow, net of minority distributions of $450 million to $550 million are still something you're able to standby right now given kind of your outlook from here?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nCarlo, at the Investor Day in August, we -- as you remember, we presented an overall framework of assumption regarding the main driver of our business. We are still comfortable with that set of assumption and the resulting improvement in the cash flow generation that we mentioned for 2019 with one exception, which is related to the impact of the -- to the impact of the Italian tax -- gaming tax increase that happened at year end. Our assumptions were based on the expected growth for the various business segments on the profitability trends and so on. These are all unchanged and therefore, we remain convinced that our cash flow generation profile will be significantly different from what we looked in the past three years.\nCarlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOkay. And sorry, just to confirm with respect to the Italy, you called out a $40 million headwind. So you are saying as that -- as we think about that $450 million to $550 million of annual free cash flow, net of distributions, we need to make an adjustment for the Italy piece?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWhat I'm saying is that, that was not in the numbers at that time. That is the only change compared to that. I made a very large you know -- provided a very larger framework regarding the growth of the different business, the profitability, the cost action. That has not changed at all.\nCarlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOkay and then, just sorry on that last point with respect to the $40 million Italy headwind in your guidance. That obviously is very limited mitigation in 2019. How do you think about that impact in 2020?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI think that the impact in 2020 will be limited. There is still a small increase in the taxes, but for now it will be very, very small.\nCarlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is open.\nChad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to focus on International for a second, I believe in 2018 part of the reason why North America was so strong was because of your test-bank process and going back to the core product. I saw that your International approach was pretty similar. So could you just kind of talk a little bit more about what could change in 2019 for International Gaming services, if maybe this was kind of a one-off year and if a lot of the learnings and successes in North America can be applied to International and have that -- have that segment grow in 2019? Thanks.\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Chad. It's Marco, I think we are positive in the -- in regard 2019 also because next year we will benefit from the Sweden VLT, but in the core part of the business as you are aware, perfectly pointing out, I think there is room for improvement in the International market. The reasons are the following. In Australia, we did very well. We grew quite substantially and we developed a set of new games that can be exported in Asia, where we are historically quite weak. And I think we can improve our performance there.\nThe same games from our Australia can be used as titles to reinforce our offsetting in other International markets. In addition to that, we have a very clear strategy in the second half of the year to improve our position in the Eastern countries in Europe and we think that we will have a better performance also in the Western country. We had a couple of geographies where we did not perform very well, but we think that the programs in those couple of geographies in Europe are already showing good momentum. More challenging will be Latin America, notwithstanding we believe that we can improve with our titles also in that area.\nDon't forget that we will continue deploying our now very well performing games in Greece. For all these reasons, we believe that we will improve our performance in North America. In addition to that and to conclude, of course, we will use some of the titles that are doing very well in North America, also in the International market.\nChad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Very comprehensive. Thank you.\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nChad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nAnd then separately, with respect to the two contracts that you said are in the 2019 outlook right now, so Brazil and the SuperEnalotto in Italy. How are you thinking about returns and then could you just remind us on the timing of the SuperEnalotto contract? Thanks.\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo. The timing, I mean, in the next few months, we'll know about the award and regarding the returns, Alberto can elaborate on it.\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe are talking about two contracts that have an upfront fee. So as we have spelled out in the past, when there is an upfront fee, the risk -- the financial risk is higher and then we tend to factor higher returns. And therefore in certain cases, for example, we have not participated to certain bids, or normally we require an higher premium for in terms of returns overall. That's the way we look at this opportunity.\nChad Beynon -- Macquarie -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nBye, Chad.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Domenico Ghilotti from Equita. Your line is open.\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nGood morning. Three questions. Three questions. The first is on the -- a follow-up on the cash generation. So if you can remind us what can be the cash taxes for '19 in order for us to, say, to elaborate on the bridge. And second question is on the Italian tax increases. I would like to understand, what are the actions that have already been taken to mitigate these -- the impact? I have the impression that all the market is running faster to reduce the payout, so I would like to have your comments. And my last question is on the inorganic options. So you were mentioning the SuperEnalotto and Brazil. Well, on the SuperEnalotto, I'm wondering why you decided to go alone, while in the past, you bid with partners for lotteries? And in Brazil, I'm wondering if you have already taken a decision on this front?\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. I will take the answers on the bids. Let's start from Brazil. The bids are due by March 20 then as you know, there is a lot to consider when investing in a greenfield opportunity like this, especially when there is a significant upfront payment. Having said that, for us, it's a compelling opportunity and we are assessing it seriously with the rigorous parameters, we use to evaluate any bid. So we will come up with our thinking in the next -- in the next days and weeks.\nRegarding SuperEnalotto, again we assess every opportunity individually. In this case, we decided not to enter in any partnership and bid alone. Having said that, we continue to have a very strong relationship with our partners. It has been -- I mean, you cannot generalize. You decide bid-by-bid what is the approach that you intend to have. Regarding the question on the recovery of the tax increase in Italy, we are doing as the rest of the market. We are trying to reshape the -- our games, changing the payout for the players and this is what it will be done over the next months. In addition to that, we continue to look at our cost structure, to streamline our cost in order to recover part of the cost increase that is due to the taxation.\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nRegarding --\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nAnd just a follow-up.\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes.\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nJust a follow-up on this last point. What is embedded in the guidance that you are providing on the impact of Italian taxation? So are you expecting to, say, recover -- to pass the higher taxes by year-end or sooner? So is there any guidance you can provide?\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo, the $40 million includes the pace we have defined technically. I mean we will do along the year, but the $40 million are the $40 million that will impact the full year.\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nYeah, I was trying to understand how prudent, you have been in this assumption --\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nIn the next quarter, I will tell you.\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nOkay, quarter-by-quarter. Okay.\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nDomenico, the only comment, additional comment is expect that the mitigation action is going to take a little bit of time. So the impact will be higher in the first quarter and lower in the future quarters, because we will have the time to implement that. That's the only comment we can make and going back to your question regarding the cash flow, we expect cash taxes to be a little higher than this year, but we expect the interest -- cash paid to be lower, OK.\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nOkay.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nBarry Jonas -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nHi guys. Just how should investors think about the longer-term risks to IGT in the Italian market? And with that, given you're bidding on SuperEnalotto, what do you think the right mix of business in Italy longer term for you? Thanks.\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think that we feel very comfortable in Italy. When I look at the performance over the last years, we have seen that the market is very resilient. The demand is very strong. The assets we have in the market in terms of brand, network, ability to have a strong CRM, the digital offering is giving us all the tools to deal with an increase complexity. So I'm very positive regarding the business area, regarding the demand.\nOf course, the uncertainty of the political situation cannot be factored in the next several years, but when I look at the market, at the end of the day, I look at the need of the government to get this money year-after-year, I continue to be positive regarding Italy.\nBarry Jonas -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And then, just given some of the pressures on VLTs, AWPs, I'm wondering if the product at some point becomes less competitive. Do you think there's overlap in the player base with your other offerings in Italy? Hence, could you see some player shifts over time to different gaming or lottery products you offer?\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nNow this is a very good question, Barry. The fact that I've been monitoring the Italian market for 15 years. As a matter of fact, if you look at the evolution of the Italian market, all the new regulation have provided additional wages and revenues for the government, and for the operators with a very minimal cannibalization.\nReality is that the target of the players are different and even when you have a player that is playing more games, they do following a different attitudes and they tend to some -- their behavior, instead of making choices. And then it happened when there have been the digital offering, it happen at the time of the gaming machines and we are monitoring the trends among the different players and we see that there is a good different positioning about the games and when the games are overlapped, the players are playing the games with a different attitude that are producing a very minor cannibalization.\nBarry Jonas -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. And then last one for me. Look, you've said in the past you could see increasing capital returns once four time leverage is in sight. So now with the license fees in Italy complete and having good visibility into free cash flow generation from here, do you have a better sense when that might be?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNo, I mean we have -- we have said we'll be progressive. We will see out -- how things will move forward. Now you understand, we also have some of these in. It also will depend on this opportunity of growth that we have, if we decided to take them or not. So I think what is going to be important is to start the deleveraging, start reducing the debt and improve our profitability to get there as quickly as possible. That is our target.\nBarry Jonas -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nThanks so much, guys.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHi, good morning everyone. Alberto, I just wanted to talk a bit more about the cadence of cash flow this year. I think in your prepared remarks, you said that more of the CapEx would be front loaded this year, and the EBITDA might be a bit more back-end loaded. Could you maybe give us a bit more color on the cadence of those two, please?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nRegarding the CapEx, I said, it's going to be in the -- is going to be in the first six months, so 60%. And then regarding -- this year is at the beginning, similar to what we said the last year that we see an increase in the EBITDA in the second half.\nIn 2018, we were able -- during the year to improve and to accelerate some of the deals and the transaction that allow us to reduce the kind of seasonality. We will try to do the same, but that is where we are today. Obviously I have more visibility on the CapEx, because we work according to schedule that regarding what we can do on EBITDA.\nI think that also, let me anticipate that probably the minority, some of the minority payments that normally are done in the second quarter could be done in the first quarter if they will not -- but it doesn't mean that there is anything else than timing at this point regarding this payment. So I would suggest to look for the cash flow at our -- for the different component, what we see for the full year, rather than be focused on the first half.\nDavid Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nUnderstood and just one follow-up. Given the heightened focus on cash flow and the prospects for capital return, I hope you don't mind if I take one more swing at that, which is, if I'm hearing correctly, the growth opportunities that are out there are really the one variable or barrier to you being able to start returning some capital, more capital sooner rather than later. There is no other barrier out there that we should be contemplating, correct?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNo, I mean, we anticipated what we are -- what is our forecast in general for the cash flow consistent, with the assumption that we had and nothing has changed compare like that. We kept -- regarding the leverage, we kept out the growth CapEx because simply it cannot be forecasted and right now, what we are seeing are the two opportunities we just mentioned, which is the SuperEnalotto and Brazil. So this is it, no change.\nDavid Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Cameron McKnight from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nCameron McKnight -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Thanks very much. A question for Alberto first. In terms of thinking about 2019 levered free cash flow, how should we think about working capital needs in 2019? Do you expect working capital be a source or use of cash?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI expect to be more or less neutral so far. That will be my expectation. This year in the first nine months, we had a series of items that impacted negatively, some of which were related to the commercial services in Italy. So we don't expect that happens for next year, so think about the net working capital as neutral. We have some initiatives that partly have generated some benefits. Also this year, we have reduced our inventory, we have streamlined our supply chain. So that is what is driving my forecast for 2019 on working cap.\nCameron McKnight -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay, so thanks. And then on the North American Gaming business, the accelerated depreciation of the older units, have you decreased the useful life on participation units generally or is that just a group of units that you've chosen to effectively get down to zero or some lower level?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNo, as you can imagine, with the change in the cabinets and the change in the content, obviously we are replacing some of the machines with the new title and the new cabinet. And so in certain cases, for the older ones, we have decided basically at the end of life of the product to basically take a charge and move on.\nCameron McKnight -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay, sure. And then, thirdly, a question for Marco. Would you mind commenting on the change in the DOJ's opinion on the Wire Act, particularly as it pertains to Powerball and Internet lottery sales?\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay, Cameron I will provide you our view on the overall DOJ opinion and our understanding is that, the intent of the opinion was to clarify DOJ's position on interstate Internet-based wagering. However, as written, the new opinion might potentially apply to a much broader scope of gaming activity. It might even encompass technology infrastructure used to support traditional retail-based Lottery and Gaming transaction. And as you were saying, also Multistate and AWPs that did not exist in 1961, where the Wire Act was enacted.\nSeveral lawsuits challenging and seeking clarification of the DOJ opinion have been filed. DOJ recently extended its regional non-prosecution period 60 days to June 14. We are evaluating the opinion and monitoring the lawsuits and industry response to it. We are also engaging with customers and other members of the industry to understand the potential impact on our businesses and to determine the best course of action and that is all I can say at this juncture.\nCameron McKnight -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nPerfect. Thank you very much.\nCarlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nThank you, Cameron.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Joe Stauff from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJoe Stauff -- Susquehanna -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask on North American Gaming in particular in the fourth quarter, replacement unit sales were up huge, right? The numbers in terms of just both the installed base were up as well as unit shipments, but the conversion into revenue, with revenue being down, can you just talk about that relationship and how to think about the model going forward, especially in 2019 with an improvement in your North American Gaming segment, in particular, product sales?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAlberto here. Over -- when you look at the revenues of the North American Gaming, first of all, you need to consider that in the comparison year-over-year, we have $50 million of revenues that are due to an accounting reclass for the ASC. What it really mean is that, revenues are up 3%. The revenues for terminals sold are up significantly. The units were up 27%. We had better ASP. So revenues are up to 34% in the quarter.\nLast year, we had in the systems and in the other parts of our business in North America higher revenues than now. That's why you don't see the full impact of the increasing terminals in the bottom line. But again, on the system side, it could be erratic from quarter-to-quarter the overall revenue. That's why we feel very positive about the performance of North American Gaming in terms of revenue.\nJoe Stauff -- Susquehanna -- Analyst\nAnd, wouldn't -- I guess going -- following up on an earlier question regarding working capital. With the turn basically in North American Gaming, wouldn't you expect basically a -- working capital to be a source of cash from this segment in particular, but I guess your commentary about flat working capital for the year is -- offsets another part of your business, is that fair to say?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWhat I was implying is the following. First of all, we have -- the working capital is impacted by the different business model of our businesses. So in Italy, it's -- it moves, it fluctuates. But in the gaming business, normally the working capital is linked to the overall volume. So, again, we mentioned that we are expecting some growth for next year. So I would expect the working capital to go up, but because we have taken several initiatives to streamline our supply chain, overall, we think that the working capital could be stable on a year-over-year basis.\nJoe Stauff -- Susquehanna -- Analyst\nAnd I guess just kind of one follow-up, I know again it's been asked a couple of times, but I just -- Marco, if you could just comment a little bit more maybe -- or maybe I'll just take a different angle on the mitigants in terms of the tools that you have at your disposable in Italy, obviously on AWPs and VLTs, those take time as you suggested, does it take six months, are you able to implement some of the mitigants earlier, maybe on the AWPs or -- and again just relative to that Italian headwind of $40 million, if we assume no mitigants, what would that number look like?\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nHigher. No, I am joking. The -- now, Alberto will tell the number. But talking about the way, the mainstream to reduce the impact comes from the fact that you change the payout of the games. On AWPs, to do that, you have to change the motherboard. For the VLTs, it's easier and faster because you can download it from the central system. But it takes months, it does not take years. It's something that you have to look progressively over the months and that we are very active and consider that we have already done in some occasions. So this is the best answer we -- I can provide. And of course you are also trying to intervene with the best features in the game structure in order to minimize the perception for the player of the reduced payout, because that is the challenge and we have been successful in doing that in the previous cases, where we maintained reality, the demand at the same level notwithstanding a decrease in terms of payout.\nAnd as I said before, we are trying also to look at all the structure of our costs when we serve our distributor or the overall supply chain trying to optimize the situation accordingly to the new profile on profitability of the game -- of the business.\nJoe Stauff -- Susquehanna -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. And we'll take our final question from Domenico Ghilotti from Equita. Your line is open.\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nYes, I have a question on the leakage that you have out of P&L on the minority that is growing year-after-year. So I'm wondering, if in this year -- so in 2018 number, there is also a significant contribution from the strong performance of the North American Lottery. So if I should expect -- so if you can provide any indication for '19 or if you can extrapolate from the 2018 number the exceptional part.\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI would say that the major driver Domenico is the performance of the Lotto. It's clear if the Lotto continue to perform very well, we will see -- and continue to grow, we will see the component of the minority in terms of their portion of the dividend of the units to go up. That is the main driver.\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nSo it could continue to go up, if the Lotto is performing as well as in the past few years?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThat is what has happened in the last two years. That has grown above over our expectation and therefore, it's having an increase on the minority.\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nOkay. And just the last question. You are currently clearly introducing so the new -- in Italian market the new machines. I'm trying to understand, what is level of payout in VLTs in particular that you are testing on the market, just to understand what is the initial, say, assumption or initial tests that you are doing?\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHonestly, I do not know the number. What I know is that the first feedback I'm receiving from the Italian team is that the products are performing quite well and they're improving the quality and the performance of our offer. So we are pretty satisfied with what we have done so far.\nDomenico Ghilotti -- Equita -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nAlberto Fornaro -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Marco Sala for any closing remarks.\nMarco Sala -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you all for your question and for your interest in IGT. 2018 was a year of good progress in reinforcing our positions in the growing global markets we operate on.
