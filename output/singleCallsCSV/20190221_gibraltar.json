Today's call is being recorded and webcasted. My name is Donna and I will be your conference coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be conducting a question-and-answer session toward the end of the conference call.\nI will now turn the call over to Dora Gonzalez from the Company's Investor Relations firm, Sharon Merrill Associates. Thank you. Please proceed.\nDora Gonzalez -- Investor Relations\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. If you have not received a copy of the earnings press release that was issued this morning, you can find it in the Investor Info section of the Gibraltar website, gibraltar1.com. During the prepared remarks today, management will be referring to presentation slides that summarize the Company's fourth quarter and full-year performance. These slides also are posted to the Company's website. Please turn to Slide 2 in the presentation. The Company's earnings press release and slide presentation contain forward-looking statements about future financial results. The Company's actual results may differ materially from anticipated events, performance, or results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nGibraltar advises you to read the risk factors detailed in its SEC filings, which can also be accessed through the Company's website. Additionally, Gibraltar's earnings press release and remarks this morning contain adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted financial measures have been appended to the earnings release and slides. On our call this morning are Gibraltar's Vice Chairman, Frank Heard; President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Bosway; and Chief Financial Officer, Tim Murphy. Tim is under the weather today and has lost his voice so Vice President and Treasurer, Jeff Watorek, will be providing the financial and segment update. Tim will be available during the Q&A.\nAt this point, I will turn the call over to Frank, and please turn to Slide 3.\nFrank G. Heard -- Vice Chairman\nThanks, Dora. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Our agenda starts with an update on the fourth quarter financial results as well as strategic achievements in our transformation in 2018. After that, Jeff will discuss our segments in more detail. Then it would be my distinct pleasure to turn the call over to our new President and CEO, Bill Bosway, who will discuss our progress on our four pillars and provide an outlook for 2019. I'd like to take the time now to officially welcome Bill to his new role at Gibraltar. Bill brings significant experience leading complex businesses at Fortune 500 Global Industrial companies and a deep expertise in driving organic innovation accelerated by strategic acquisitions and he shares our view on the need for continued operational excellence and he's the ideal selection to take Gibraltar into its next phase of profitable growth. We're very excited to have Bill on board and welcome, Bill.\nWith that, I'll get right into the fourth quarter results. We closed the fourth year of our transformation of Gibraltar delivering fourth quarter revenues in line with our expectations and earnings that exceeded our guidance. By executing on our four-pillar strategy, we recovered increased material costs, benefited from higher margin innovation projects, and drove growth in the Industrial and Infrastructure segment. Financially, our fourth quarter revenues of $241 million were in line with our guidance range though lower year-over-year as we faced challenging comparisons in the Residential and Renewable Energy & Conservation segments. Our GAAP earnings of $0.40 and non-GAAP earnings of $0.47 well exceeded our guidance. Non-GAAP earnings were up from $0.41 last year. Our performance was driven by growth in our Industrial and Infrastructure segment, effective material cost management, and the benefits from our 80/20 operational initiatives. Please turn to Slide 4 entitled Year 4: Continued Progress. For the full year for the fourth year in a row, we delivered on our promise of making more money at a higher rate of return with more efficient use of capital.\nRevenues of $1 billion were in line with our guidance while GAAP earnings of $1.97 and non-GAAP earnings of $2.14 exceeded our expectations. During the year, we achieved 150 basis points of margin improvement from the 80/20 simplification initiatives, recovered 100% of material cost inflation demonstrating our team's ability as solid business operators, increased the percentage of higher margin innovative products, achieved an organic growth through the commercialization of our perimeter security and solar tracker solutions, and further refined our portfolio to limit our downside risk and take advantage of rising tides in the Renewable Energy & Conservation segments, and further position the Company for the next step in its transformation by reducing our debt and bringing on a new CEO with proven expertise in achieving organic and M&A growth. As you'll hear from Bill later in the call, we entered 2019 with strong operational discipline and a focus on markets with meaningful upside opportunities.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to our Treasurer, Jeff Watorek, who will provide Tim's financial update today. And as Dora mentioned in the introductions, Tim's a little under the weather but is here in the room with us and will be available during the Q&A. Jeff?\nJeffrey J. Watorek -- Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary\nThank you, Frank, and good morning everyone. Let's move to Slide 5 in the presentation entitled Solid Consolidated Results. As expected, consolidated revenues decreased 7% from the prior year fourth quarter. Growth in the Industrial and Infrastructure segment was offset by difficult year-over-year comparison in the Residential and Renewable Energy & Conservation segments as favorable weather extended the construction season into Q4 a year ago. On the bottom line, our consolidated GAAP earnings, which exceeded our guidance, were down year-over-year mainly due to the benefit we recognized from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in Q4 of 2017. When normalized for taxes, GAAP earnings per share were up $0.01. Consolidated adjusted earnings also above our guidance benefited from growth in the Industrial and Infrastructure segment, effective price material cost management, and continued benefits from 80/20 simplification initiatives.\nNote that corporate expenses in the fourth quarter were $6.2 million compared with $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflecting normalized performance-based compensation levels. During the quarter, we announced the repayment of our Senior Sub 6.25% notes, which were due February 1st, 2021. The repayment occurred on February 1st, 2019, and we anticipate annualized savings of $13 million in interest payments or $0.22 of an increase to diluted earnings per share in 2019. Now, let's review each of our three reporting segments starting with Slide 6, the Residential Products segment. Revenues in the Residential segment decreased 3% as we anticipated due to a difficult year-over-year comparison as favorable weather and a higher level of storm-related activity extended the roofing season a year ago. On the bottom line, operating margin declined due to unfavorable product mix and to a lesser extent volume leverage.\nThis was partially offset by benefits from the 80/20 simplification initiatives. Going into 2019, we expect a modest level of growth in this segment driven by sustained levels of repair and remodeling activity. We also expect more favorable comparison as the seasonal normal roofing activity that we saw in 2018 should continue into 2019. Turning to Slide 7, the Industrial and Infrastructure Product segment. Revenues were up 3% year-over-year in the quarter driven by increased activity in the infrastructure business. On the bottom line, operating margins benefited from a more favorable product mix, effective management of material cost to customer selling prices, and the continued benefit from 80/20 simplification initiatives. Looking ahead, we expect increased project activity in our infrastructure business and continued contributions from innovative products and ongoing 80/20 simplification activities.\nNow turning to Slide 8, the Renewable Energy & Conservation segment. As anticipated, revenues decreased 15% as continued demand for our innovative tracker solution was more than offset by a difficult comparison resulting from an extended construction season last year due to favorable weather in the fourth quarter of 2017. On the bottom line, volume and product mix particularly offset -- partially offset by ongoing benefits from 80/20 simplification initiatives and effective material cost to customer price management contributed to the decrease in fourth quarter 2018 GAAP and adjusted operating margins. We expect to continue to see strong market demand for our products and services in this segment with the continued adoption of renewable energy and the expansion of legalized cannabis.\nPlease turn to Slide 9, Capturing the Opportunity. During the quarter, we generated $51.6 million of cash from operations primarily from seasonal balance sheet investment reductions. In January, we closed on a new $400 million five-year revolving credit facility, which replaced a $300 million revolving credit agreement due to mature in December of 2020. In addition to increasing our credit capacity by $100 million, the new\nagreement includes a $300 million accordion and provides enhanced flexibility for capital allocation. It also allowed the February 1st, 2019 repayment of the $210 million of 6.25% notes that were outstanding at year-end. As a result, we are well positioned to execute on our acquisition strategy. As you know, our focus is on target with EBITDA of $25 million up to $100 million that would be material to our performance although we consider smaller acquisitions that could benefit us from a technology standpoint as well.\nAt this point, I will turn it back to Frank. Frank?\nFrank G. Heard -- Vice Chairman\nThank you, Jeff. The next step in Gibraltar's transformation is to enhance our focus. We recently announced the appointment of Bill Bosway as President and Chief Executive Officer of Gibraltar to lead in this effort. In my new role as Vice Chairman of the Board, my main goal is to ensure a smooth and swift transition to support Bill's onboarding at Gibraltar. I'll also work with the Company on special projects as requested by the Board of Directors. I'd like to thank the Gibraltar team, our shareholders and customers for your trust and continued support throughout Gibraltar's ongoing transformation.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Bill. Please turn to Slide 10, 4 Pillars Driving Value Creation.\nWilliam T. Bosway -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Frank, for the warm welcome, and good morning, everybody. I'm joining Gibraltar at the beginning of year five of our transformation with a lot of momentum that's been built around our existing four-pillar strategy and I think you're quite familiar with that. But as a reminder, our 80/20 simplification efforts in innovation, portfolio management, acquisitions have been -- have really driven the strategy today and I just want to let you know we're going to continue working very hard on that. I'm particularly going to focus on three areas. First, accelerating our 80/20 operating cadence; secondly, driving growth through really a combination of trade focus, innovation, and new products; and then third, identifying acquisition opportunities that strengthen our presence and relevance in the key markets that we serve. Now before I discuss these three in a little more depth, I do want to comment on our portfolio management efforts.\nOur teams have done a good job evaluating our product lines and customers as well as our end markets and as a result, we've been really good at allocating our leadership time and resources to bring the biggest impact to our platforms and our businesses and this is going to continue. As Frank highlighted earlier, the Company is in now a good position to grow both our presence and relevance in our key rising tide markets like our Renewable Energy & Conservation markets. I'm particularly excited about our solar energy and greenhouse businesses as they participate in strong end markets and offer us an opportunity to expand our role in serving these industries going forward. So, let's switch gears. Let me talk a little bit more about accelerating our 80/20 operating cadence.\nIn 2018 we advanced both in-lining and market rate of demand and replenishment initiatives, but also a number of outsourcing projects across each of our businesses and as a result, were able to achieve 120 basis point improvement during the fourth quarter and as you saw earlier, 150 basis point improvement on a full-year basis. So, clearly we want to continue this momentum and while there has been significant progress, we're not done and we're going to continue to drive productivity through reducing the complexity of our businesses as well as simplifying our product lines. So, let me switch gears and talk a little bit about growth and how we're going to go about generating that. We're going to drive that through really three things that are really interdependent on each other and that's trade focus, innovation, and new product development; and all three are important for success.\nIf I were to characterize this, I'd say the key to our success in this area is to make sure that our customers have real authentic demand for our products and services. And what that really means is we have to understand our customer challenges and their problems in a little more depth, we got to solve these problems. So, we eliminate any chance that our customers can become indifferent toward what we do for them. And basically, this requires a better, more thorough understanding of our market and our customers; but also being able to provide timely and innovative solutions through a strong new product and service development engine. As it relates to trade focus, we actually have started deploying processes and tools to help our teams engage customers differently, really identify customer problems from a different perspective, but also understand the broader industry challenges in front of us and our entire channel.\nWe made our first key -- I'd say our first key resource investment recently by adding an experienced senior executive to lead this initiative in our Residential Products group. Now the scope of this role includes marketing, business development, trade focus, and innovation; but also helping us build a team with the right competencies and providing the training and education for the organization. So, I'm really excited about this first investment. There'll be more to come in this area and I'm looking forward to seeing good results in 2019. Now in regard to innovation of new products, we're also making good progress here. 2018 patented products represented 11% of our revenues, that's up 7 -- up from 7% in 2017 and up from 4% in 2014. So, we have a little bit of a momentum build there as well. But I think we have significant opportunity to grow our new product sales in a number of our businesses and I think the teams are excited to have that opportunity.\nIn my past positions, I've been fortunate to have had the opportunity to lead innovation efforts as well as new product development, but also sales and marketing operations and all of these functional areas will contribute to our ability to grow organically through innovation of new products. But whether it's been launching new innovation centers, developing software electronics businesses, or just reassessing roll-out new business models; it's been a tremendous learning experience, but also a significant challenge. But I'm looking forward to leveraging some of my experience with our teams here in helping build out our capability in this area. And then finally, I just want to touch on a third area of focus, which is acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, we continued the integration of SolarBos into our operations. I think with having electrical balance of systems basically being part -- an important part of all solar projects, we're pretty excited about our cross-selling opportunities, but also SolarBos' growth prospects.\nAs we get into 2019, particularly as we evolve our overall strategy, we'll continue to assess acquisition opportunities that create a stronger position for us in key markets, really looking to drive more relevance and leadership in these spaces for us and -- and obviously deliver immediate and longer-term value for our shareholders. We've got a pretty good pipeline that's been developed and I'm looking forward to solidifying our plans in the next few quarters. So if you will, let's turn to Slide 11 and let's talk a little about 2019 guidance. We entered 2019 with good confidence in our end markets and we expect to increase -- to deliver increased profits and a robust platform for organic growth.\nBut at the same time, I am a bit cautious about the general economy and I think everyone sees the variables out there in play, but also we have a little bit of a continued volatility in material cost. But with that, we feel like we stick to our plan that revolves around our pillars that are in place and the momentum that we have, we feel like -- we feel good about 2019. We're going to accelerate our 80/20 operating cadence. We're going to execute our growth initiatives by strengthening our core competencies and trade focus innovation and new product development. And as I mentioned, we're going to build on our existing presence in key markets through our acquisitions. Now for the full-year 2019, we expect sales in the range of $1.030 billion to $1.050 billion. We expect GAAP EPS between $1.95 and $2.10 per diluted share. That compares to $1.96 in 2018 or between $2.40 and $2.55 on an adjusted basis, up from $2.14 in 2018.\nFor the first quarter in '19, we expect revenues between $218 million to $224 million. That will put us up between 1% and 4% versus first quarter of 2018. We expect our consolidated GAAP EPS between $0.14 and $0.19 per diluted share or between $0.27 and $0.32 on an adjusted basis. So, let me just summarize, if you will. I think Gibraltar is -- in my limited time here, it's a company with a lot of great people that are very enthusiastic about continuing on with our four-pillar strategy and the momentum that has been created. And I'm very excited to be part of the team, but also lead the team. We've achieved a significant amount of progress over the past four years and this success is creating even greater opportunities for us I believe going forward. Our four-pillar strategy, which is important to us, drives even more upside for us and helps minimize any downside risk. But also with the recent repayment of our notes, we enter this year of our transformation with a strong platform to accelerate our growth both organically and inorganically and create long-term value for our shareholders.\nSo, I'll close by saying I'm excited about 2019. I look forward to us making more money at a higher rate of return with a more efficient use of capital and I look forward also to meeting each of you in person as we get on the road and have a chance to visit with you in the coming months. So at this point, we'll open the call up for any questions that you may have.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Dan Moore of CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nDan Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nWilliam T. Bosway -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Dan.\nDan Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nTim, feel better wherever you are.\nTimothy F. Murphy -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nDan Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nFirst question, in terms of the revenue guide, you gave pretty good color by end markets, but as we look at 2019 various puts and takes. Is there any divestments, any material revenue that you maybe exiting in the guide, number one? Number two, kind of a range of implied growth for the renewables and solar business? And a quick follow-up or two.\nTimothy F. Murphy -- Chief Financial Officer\nDan, so I'll try to answer that. I think no -- nothing significant in divestments. We always are going through our CLS PLS so that's an ongoing process and we'll always either convert or exit products and customers as we go through the 80/20 process. When I think about growth, we're not giving any specific guide for each segment. But I would say that if you look at roofing which drives a lot of our Residential, most of the forecast that we see in talking to partners is that that market is really consistent with what we saw in 2018. 2017 had that seasonal spike for storms so we don't see any of that recurring. So, we think '18 -- '19 looks a lot like '18 in resi. On the industrial and infrastructure market, I think two things. We think infrastructure, we're finally seeing a little bit of improvement there. Certainly backlog is growing, pipeline has increased. It's been really bouncing along the bottom for quite some time. We did see a little growth in the third -- in the fourth quarter, excuse me, and I think we expect modest growth there. Innovative products on the industrial side will help drive growth also. And then when I think about renewable and conservation, strong demand in both sides of the market, continued adoption of renewable energy, and then the continued legalization of cannabis, and other drivers of demand on the greenhouse side.\nDan Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nHelpful. Similar question in terms of the 80/20 opportunity and margin upside. How would you sort of rank order your businesses there in 2019 relative to what we saw on adjusted basis in '18?\nTimothy F. Murphy -- Chief Financial Officer\nExpect everybody to get better every year and we've got projects already planned, projects that started in '18 that carryover and provide benefits in '19. So, expectation is to get better.\nDan Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. And lastly, Bill, welcome, look forward to meeting you. Obviously it's still early, but is there anything you can sort of tell us about your approach to M&A that may or may not differ from Gibraltar's approach over the last several years? You mentioned renewables, obviously greenhouse as being a focus, what are the key solutions or product lines that you're most keen on expanding and exploring?\nWilliam T. Bosway -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I wouldn't say there is a dramatically different approach relative to assessing our opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, my main focus on the subject is really looking at the spaces we're in and how relevant we can become and how broad we can play where we become a leader in that space. So there's -- like I said earlier, a lot of opportunities have been identified. I think there has been a lot of good work done on spaces and I think over the next few quarters with the team, we'll have a little better -- we'll have a little more clarity on what we might pursue. But I would not characterize it as being completely unique from what the team has been working on.\nDan Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it, appreciate it. And Frank, thank you for all of your help if you don't speak on these calls on a go-forward basis. Greatly appreciate it.\nFrank G. Heard -- Vice Chairman\nYes. Well, I appreciate it, Dan, and probably see you one more time on our road show. But yes, after that maybe not so much.\nDan Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nThanks.\nFrank G. Heard -- Vice Chairman\nAll right. Take care.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Julio Romero of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, everyone.\nFrank G. Heard -- Vice Chairman\nJulio, how are you?\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nVery well, Frank. Congrats on your success over the last few years at Gibraltar and congratulations to Bill as well on the new role.\nWilliam T. Bosway -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nFrank G. Heard -- Vice Chairman\nThank you.\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nSo, I was hoping to drill down a little bit on the underlying residential demand. I understand another industry player, not so much related to you guys, they talked about on their conference call expecting lower roofing volumes for the entire industry year-over-year. So -- in speaking to your customers and speaking to ARMA, I was hoping for a little more color on the residential side?\nTimothy F. Murphy -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think what we've heard from roofing from everything we've done, Julio, is plus or minus 3%, which tells me effectively the same market that we face this year. And then, I guess depending on region so that will be likely -- usually when that happens, there will be also regions that are up and other regions that are down within that. And so it's mid-February, there has been bad weather in parts of January so season's probably a little slow, but it's also the slowest part of the year. So, I think everything we hear is that it's probably very similar to last year.\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nUnderstood. And I was hoping to ask about the expected revenue contribution from new product innovations in 2019. I know you mentioned patented products were up 11% so what would be a fair forecast there for 2019?\nTimothy F. Murphy -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean, growing. We continue to grow tracker, perimeter security, and our electronic parcel locker; all factor into the growth, all relatively small today relative to the consolidated Gibraltar. But in each of the last three years, obviously been growing at a rate faster than the core. So, we expect that to continue.\nJulio Romero -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. Very good. Thanks for taking my questions and best of luck in 2019.\nFrank G. Heard -- Vice Chairman\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Walter Liptak of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nWalter Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nFrank G. Heard -- Vice Chairman\nGood morning, Walt.\nWalter Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst\nGood morning. And welcome aboard, Bill. It's good to have you on the team. I wonder if I could ask first about -- just to Bill about 80/20. And I get an idea 80/20 has been a really big part of what Frank Heard has brought to the Company and really transformed it. And I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about your background and what you think of 80/20 so far at the Company?\nWilliam T. Bosway -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nFrank and I are completely aligned on the necessity to have an 80/20 operating cadence to be institutionalized in this business not just for the last four years, but on an ongoing basis. So, I kind of grew up in this world in my last 27 years. Having an operations background myself and being engaged in 80/20 for the majority my career, I'm a big believer. I think it's a much -- it has application beyond our operations per se as people might perceive it to be, but it's very applicable across all the things that we do. So, I'll reassure you as well as our team that might be listening on the phone this is going to be a continued focus for us. We're gonna accelerate it, institutionalize it even more, and it's foundational for us to be able to grow because it's gives us the ability to fund things like innovation, new products, as well as investments in trade focus. So, it's an absolute must for us going forward.\nWalter Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst\nOkay, sounds great. Kind of along those lines, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the liquidity slide and the strategic purpose for the new credit facility. I mean the numbers keep kind of stepping up and they did last year. What's the thought behind continuing to increase that?\nTimothy F. Murphy -- Chief Financial Officer\nWalt, I'll talk to that. So we decided from a tactical perspective, we can take out the bonds with cash on hand and save $13 million annualized interest, about $0.22 this year and obviously we're not earning 6.25% on the cash as it sits in the bank. So, it just seemed like a good use of the money in the short term. When we did that, obviously we spent some of our dry powder and so we wanted to arrange the ability to move quickly in transactions because one of our advantages sometimes is certainty to close when we're pursuing targets and so we were able to redo the credit facility that was due to expire in December of 2020. So, we would have been doing it by the end of this year anyway and we had to amend it to allow the repayment of the bonds. So we rolled all of that into one transaction, upsized it a little bit to continue to provide us with the dry powder needed, and we put the accordion in so that net-net we would have with the accordion about the same availability as we had when we had the bond sitting out there. So, I view it almost as very little change to the capital structure other than the fact that it's lower cost right now.\nWalter Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst\nOkay. All right, great. And Tim, since I've got you, let me just ask a couple on CapEx that's stepping up a -- you guys don't spend very much money at all on CapEx, but it is stepping up. I wonder what the reason behind that is. And 2019 tax rate, if you can give us some idea of what that will look like?\nTimothy F. Murphy -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So CapEx, if you remember last year we projected almost 20 (ph) and we didn't spend it. So, there is some carryover projects in in-lining. There is some equipment upgrades around some new products that we've put in the budget. So other than that, really just sort of the normal run rate. When I look at taxes, we benefited in '18 from some deductions around stock comp under the new accounting rules. When you issue stock at a lower price and you take that expense through your P&L for GAAP would invest at a higher price, you get to report that difference as a tax benefit. We don't really see -- we did get a fair benefit almost. It's not quite 300 basis points, but it was in the 200-plus basis points last year. We don't expect that to recur. So, we think about 27% on the adjusted basis and we're a little bit above 28% on GAAP and the 28% on GAAP, the difference really relates to the inability to deduct executive comp over $1 million. The performance-based exclusions don't apply to us anymore. So, we'll face a higher GAAP rate.\nWalter Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst\nOkay. All right. Thanks for that. And then just a last one real quick. Any -- I wonder if there's anything you could provide about 2019 and the cannabis outlook. I think by customers that you're talking to regionally where the spend is, what kind of a year is it and if it's not going to be a good year, when does it start to get good? And then also on infrastructure, any big programs? I'm thinking along the lines of your perimeter security business, anything incremental there? Thanks.\nTimothy F. Murphy -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo, let me start with cannabis. We expect a better year this year than we had last year. We had some project delays last year. Certainly pipeline and demand are up. Given that it's a new industry, what we find is the state passes the law that legalizes it and then they put in all the rights to allow it to get legalized and then they issue licenses and then when somebody goes to actually break ground sometimes, there's zoning issue. So, there is just -- this is sort of a longer cycle time to get the project started. So, we have contracts in hand where we're waiting for permits. And so we were a little delayed last year, those should go this year. Hopefully, we'll continue to build backlog in that space and we'll see. But certainly end market demand is there, more and more states are -- we're based in New York.\nNew York has a Democratic House Senate and Governor and they're openly saying that it's going to be recreational legal here sometime this year.\nNow when the actual product starts getting grown for recreational basis in New York, I wouldn't expect that to happen this year just given all that the timeline I talked about. But still strong market that's going to provide most of the growth in the greenhouse side of the business over the next five years is our expectation. On perimeter security, team continues to get specified with various customers, pipelines growing, backlogs growing. So, we're happy with that. It would be nice, like with any business if we could grow it quicker, we'd be happier but it's showing solid growth.\nWalter Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is a follow-up coming from Dan Moore of CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nDan Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nThank you again. Yes, I was going to ask about the CapEx as well ticking higher. So, I think my follow-ups have been covered. But I appreciate it.\nFrank G. Heard -- Vice Chairman\nSure.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we have come to the end of the Q&A session. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Bosway for any closing or additional comments.\nWilliam T. Bosway -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, I just want to thank everyone again for joining us today.
