Please go ahead, sir.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Christine, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year financial results conference call. I'm joined today by Ron Tsoumas, our Chief Financial Officer. Both Ron and I have comments, and afterwards, we will take your questions.To start, I will ask you to turn to Slide 4. In fiscal 2019 we continued on our deliberate path to transform the Company into a higher margin business that should command a higher multiple compared to the typical automotive suppliers today. Methode has been focused on this objective for some time and the acquisition of the Grakon solidifies our Industrial segment, clearly setting us on a path to diversify into new end markets, expand our customer base and product line offering and reduce our automotive concentration.In fiscal 2019, Methode eclipsed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in our history, despite the decline in global passenger car production and tariff-induced headwinds as well as the introduction of the new European emission and testing standards, all of which reduced our automotive sales by $47 million for the fiscal year compared to fiscal 2018. Through our acquisitions and continued investment in technologies and vertical integration, we have positioned Methode to become a one-stop shop for LED lighting solutions, integrated user interfaces and sensors. Today, these complementary products, technology and manufacturing capabilities will allow us to capitalize on important trends in both the automotive and industrial segments, safety, autonomous and electrification.OEMs are tracking less about discrete functionality and more about feedback control. And this is where our sensor solutions can bring innovation and unique custom solutions. For instance, our magneto-elastic sensing technology already deployed to provide pedal assist on e-bikes, steering of systems, sport and recreation vehicles, clutch plate position and active roll control for automobiles, can also be utilized to measure and manage trailer weight and towing dynamics to improve safety for both automobiles and commercial vehicles.Additionally, lighting has become one of the most critical elements for automotive and commercial vehicle OEMs to innovate and differentiate their vehicles to attract customers and drivers. Pacific Insight's innovation and technology in RGB LED based ambient and direct lighting has expanded Methode's presence within the interior, providing enhanced functionality, styling and safety. Grakon's exterior lighting capabilities support Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. These new opportunities in interior and exterior lighting provide opportunity for market share gains across Methode.Finally, our expertise in both power distribution and automotive manufacturing, allows us to meet the electric vehicle OEMs high voltage power requirements which are validated to automotive requirements. Combining these two expertise from a single supplier, provides brand differentiating ideas and system critical best-in-class solutions to the customers. Our innovative solutions to the EV market provide a tremendous opportunity for growth through both increased market penetration and content per vehicle.Next, I'd like to take a moment to update you on our Grakon integration efforts. As we've talked about in the past, one of the synergies in the acquisition was to present Grakon customers, the breadth of Methode's technologies and solutions as their customers have been requesting to see Methode's capabilities since the acquisition closed. We just concluded the first of -- two of a number of planned Tech Days with Grakon's commercial vehicle OEM customers. Through functioning product demos, we illustrated a broad range of Methode's HMI, lighting, power distribution and sensor capabilities. Our Tech Day events were visited by management, engineering, purchasing and their design studios. We also demonstrated our expertise in forward lighting and some of the potential applications of our Magneto-elastic sensor technology. The Methode Grakon team will continue with three additional onsite Tech Days over the summer. Finally on this Slide, as I will touch more in a few minutes, Dabir passed the milestone of $1 million in revenue and we continued to make significant progress in both the number of Dabir Surfaces sold and lowering the average evaluation time.Looking at the financials on Slide 5. Consolidated sales improved year-over-year 6.8% in the quarter and 10.1% for the year. In the fourth quarter of this year, non-GAAP adjusted income from operations increased 23.6% over last year. For the year, non-GAAP adjusted income from operations grew 14.6% over last year. These figures exclude expenses for initiatives to reduce costs and improve profitability and acquisition related costs in the applicable periods. Non-GAAP adjusted consolidate gross margins improved year-over-year 210 basis points in the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the year. This excludes expenses for initiatives to reduce costs and improve profitability as well as acquisition related purchase accounting adjustments in the applicable periods.Next, I'll be referring to Slide 6, to look at the key drivers to our sales performance this year versus last year. For the fourth quarter, Grakon and organic growth contributed $55 million in sales more than offsetting reduced vehicle production volumes that our customers impacted by the shift away from passenger cars. Fourth quarter sales were also negatively impacted by the continued late start of a major appliance program and reduced data program volumes in the Interface segment, as well as an unfavorable currency impact.Looking at the full year sales on Slide 7, acquisitions and organic growth including new launches contributed $196 million in sales, again more than offsetting the global auto slowdown and production headwinds as well as pricing reductions and the adoption of a new accounting standard regarding revenue recognition which affected the accounting of tooling sales. Consolidated sales were also negatively impacted by the late start of the major appliance program and reduced data program volumes, Interface segment as well as currency headwinds.Now let's move on with an update on Dabir on Slide 8. As we look back on this past year, at Dabir, our revenue increased fourfold to $1 million in fiscal 2019. Additionally, our number of paying customers doubled from 8 to 16 growing to 20 already this fiscal year. We also moved from the Dabir being predominantly utilized in the cardiovascular operating in the last fiscal year to be adopted in other areas of the hospital network such as general surgery, transplant, ICU, plastics, neurology and electrophysiology. Additionally, as this slide shows, our overall evaluation period has been reduced from 85 days to an average of 69 days due to product awareness and better acceptance in the marketplace.Even as we continue to add new customers this fiscal year, we will be focused on expanding within our current customer base as we go from the operator room to other departments and from a single hospital to the entire hospital system. Finally, the key internal measure we used to judge Dabir's progress is number of surfaces sold, which has increased year-over-year 5 times from 79 in fiscal 2018 to 462 in fiscal 2019. Excluding controller sales and leases, revenue attributed to Surface alone has grown from 64,000 in fiscal 2018 to over 476,000 in fiscal '19. As we noted in the release this morning, we anticipate revenues of $3 million to $5 million this year for Dabir.At this point, I'll turn the call over Ron, who will provide more detail on financial results and review guidance.Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Don, and good morning everyone. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter net income decreased $14.2 million to $22.6 million or $0.60 per share from $36.8 million or $0.98 per share for the same period of last year. For fiscal '19, GAAP net income increased $34.4 million to $91.6 million or $2.43 per share from $57.2 million or $1.52 per share in fiscal '18. As you'll recall in fiscal '18, we incurred $53.7 million of tax expense related to US tax reform.For the fourth quarter, tax expense increased $13.5 million or $0.36 per share mainly due to a decrease in investment tax credits of $8.9 million this fiscal year and a tax benefit of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to US tax reform. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 24.9% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, tax expense decreased by $54.6 million mainly as a result of lower tax expense of $58.5 million from last year partially offset by lower investment tax credits of $7.8 million year-over-year in this fiscal year. The net impact of these two factors was a benefit to fiscal 2019 net income of $50.7 million or $1.35 per share. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 11.6% for fiscal '19. Lower than anticipated investment tax credits for the year had the effect of increasing our effective tax rate from the guidance range of 9% to 11% which we provided throughout the year.Negatively impacted fourth quarter and full year GAAP net income was increased intangible asset amortization, stock-based compensation and interest expenses, reduced passenger car demand and production globally and currency rate fluctuations. Full year GAAP net income was also negatively impacted by increased acquisition related costs, initiatives to reduce costs and improve profitability, net tariff expense and lower international government grants. Fourth quarter and full year GAAP net income benefited from results from Grakon and lower SG&A expenses excluding Grakon, while the full year benefited from results from acquisitions and lower legal expenses.Moving to Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, automotive and currency headwinds provided -- proved to be greater than anticipated. Additionally, sales at the very lower end of our guidance range were a key contributor to lower results, but the lower year-over-year investment tax credits, I just discussed were nearly as impactful. Tariff mitigation efforts and currency headwinds also negatively impacted our results.Moving to Slide 10. Non-GAAP adjusted gross margins improved 100 basis points year-over-year in fiscal 2019 and exclude expenses for initiatives to reduce costs and improve profitability and purchase accounting adjustments related to the inventory. Gross margins were negatively impacted by an unfavorable sales mix and customer pricing reductions in the automotive segment as well as significantly reduced sales in the Interface segment, partially offset by a favorable sales mix in the Industrial segment. Non-GAAP selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 40 basis points in fiscal 2019, and exclude the acquisition related costs, expenses for initiatives to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability and long term incentive plan accrual adjustments in the applicable periods. A main contributor to the improvement was lower legal expenses of $5.1 million.Shifting to EBITDA on Slide 11. The company generated $155 million of EBITDA in fiscal 2019 or 15.5% of sales versus $153 million or 16.8% of sales in the same period last year. However, adjusting for expenses for initiatives to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability, acquisition related costs and long term incentive plan accrual adjustments in the applicable periods, adjusted EBITDA improved year-over-year to $185 million or 18.5% of sales in fiscal '19 versus $154 million or 16.9% of sales in fiscal '18.A few other financial items to review. Year-over-year, intangible asset amortization expense in fiscal '19 increased $10.5 million or 187.5% to $16.1 million, primarily due to amortization expense related to our Pacific Insight, Procoplast and Grakon acquisitions. In fiscal 2019, we invested approximately $50 million in CapEx mainly to support programs and launches in North America and Europe. Expense for depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2019 was $43.3 million.Let's move to Slide 12. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 was $85.1 million. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio which is used for our bank covenants is approximately 1.7.Moving to Slide 13. I'll finish up my remarks with guidance. As a reminder, the guidance ranges for fiscal 2020 are based upon management's expectation regarding a variety of factors and involve a number of risks and uncertainties which have been detailed in this morning's release in the Form 10-K. As we announced this morning, we anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.17 billion. Pre-tax income in the range of $150.3 million to $164.3 million, and earnings per share in the range of $3.25 per share to $3.55 per share. Although, we normally do not give quarterly guidance, we anticipate sales for the first quarter will likely be lower than the other three quarters due to the fact that the majority of our new automotive and e-bike program launches will not be at full production volumes.Additionally, the delayed laundry care program is anticipated to launch in our third quarter. We estimate that our effective tax rate will be in the range of 18% to 21% in fiscal 2020. The higher tax rate is due to new provisions under the US tax reform namely GILTI, and the mix of earnings from our businesses. For fiscal 2020 we are anticipating capital investment to be in the $48 million to $54 million range and depreciation and amortization to be between $51 million and $54 million. Finally, we expect fiscal 2020 free cash flow to be between $122 million and $136 million.In conclusion, please move to Slide 14 to take a look at our key drivers of our anticipated EBITDA performance for fiscal 2020. Looking at fiscal '19 EBITDA of $155 million and getting the EBITDA from new automotive and laundry program launches of about $19 million. Adding EBITDA from a full year of Grakon, which adds another $19 million, subtracting the impact of the loss of EBITDA from reduced passenger car reductions which we estimate to be about $12 million. Adding the benefit of initiatives to reduce costs and improve profitability of about $11 million and adding one-time costs we incurred in fiscal 2019 for acquisitions and restructuring for about $29 million.Don, that concludes my comments.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerRon, thank you very much. Christine, we are ready to take questions.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:OperatorThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Chris Van Horn with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your question.Christopher Van Horn -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystGood morning. Thank you for taking my call.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Chris.Christopher Van Horn -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystI was wondering if you could get a little bit of detail of what you're assuming for automotive production. Are you using either LMC or IHS as kind of a benchmark or we've heard from some other suppliers that they might be kind of handicapping that either direction based on what they see from their mix in terms of how they're thinking about production rates.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerWe use LMC and probably the correct term, we do handicap that up and down based on our knowledge of the customers' demand. But we for the most part, use that and then we'll occasionally we will double check with IHS, if we see a number that doesn't look right to us. But generally we're looking at LMC.Christopher Van Horn -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystOkay. Got it. And then so it seems like you've got some visibility into the back half of your fiscal '20 as you mentioned in the comments in terms of, is that you see program launches for you on the automotive side or is there a macro or -- a macro event that you're seeing? What's kind of driving that comment?Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerI think for the most part we take a conservative approach to worldwide auto and again handicapping LMC and maybe we handicap it more to the negative than to the positive. But we do have the visibility of the launches we know when the launches will come, we know what the ramp up is, like the variable there is do they launch at the volumes that we've predicted. And then also we talked about -- Ron talked about the delay in the laundry program that's going to launch in October. So as we showed up on one chart, those launches contribute to our income and EBITDA for the year. Although again more in the second, third and fourth quarter than in this for the first quarter. We've also built in a decline in Class 8 sales in the second half of the year.Christopher Van Horn -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystOkay. Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for that color. And then obviously tariff you're assuming some tariffs in your guidance here. Maybe you could highlight it. What are your mitigation efforts there if at all or do you intend to pass along some of that to the end customer? How do you see the tariff playing out assuming it actually happens?Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerWell I mean from a Chinese tariffs we're there. I mean we've built in 25% and that equates to about $8.5 million. We have -- we are sharing some of the expenses with our customers and we've provided them a mitigation plan, some of which is just shipping into Mexico for Mexican production versus shipping into the US and then transferring to Mexico. And then some of it is using our other plants for manufacturing. And when we're in the I would say the trial period of those very shipments and gets fairly complicated from a tariff standpoint of what constitutes a material transformation. So we've communicated with our customers, here's what we can do for you. Here's the time frame. And if we can do it center of that $8.5 million, will be reduced obviously if China and the US come to terms, that'll help also.Christopher Van Horn -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystOkay. Got it. And then last for me just on capital deployment, you obviously you're generating some decent free cash here. And just curious I know you pay dividend but have you considered buybacks and anything else you're considering from a capital deployment standpoint?Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerI think we always do look at our various options and discuss that with the board. Our preference right now is to pay down debt and we have the capability of doing that. So that would probably the number one deployment. I don't rule out another acquisition if one came about. But right now the main uses obviously our capital uses to support our businesses and our program launches but -- and the dividend but we're focusing on debt reduction.Christopher Van Horn -- B. Riley FBR -- AnalystOkay. Thanks so much for the time guys. Appreciate it.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Chris.OperatorOur next question comes from line of Steve Dyer with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum -- AnalystHey, guys, Ryan Sigdahl on for Steve.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum -- AnalystTo start, what does revenue guidance imply for organic growth? And then secondly given the challenging automotive environment, what gives you the confidence to significantly outperform that? I know the EBITDA bridge shows new awards and whatnot but a little more color there would be helpful.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerSure. I mean, the bridge shows $19 million of organic growth, that's what we're anticipating. But to the question, what gives us confidence in let's call it our legacy auto business? I mean we do have the benefit of releases from the customer. We know the launch schedules are. Could there be a further decline in Europe? Yes, I mean, when you're looking out, you're fairly confident in your first three months, the second three months get a little fuzzier and then the second half of the year, it could be up or it could be down. So, I don't know if we can add any more colors to the math. We tend to be conservative but we saw in our fourth quarter that our European revenues were down further than we thought they would be.Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThat's been baked into the forecast for this year.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerYes. And if I -- if you're a run rate guy and I am and I can take the fourth quarter and you take out all the noise and you multiply it by 4 and well OK but at least (ph) we are not there completely but we're getting there. And then I've also got the benefit of looking at the first quarter. So, based on that we're confident in the numbers that we put out in guidance.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum -- AnalystAnd then as it relates to GM's truck and SUV platform transitioning from K2 to the T1, any thoughts there I guess based on what you're seeing from current forecasts on, is that a flattish type production this year or do you think that can grow?Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerIn an area that I really have to be careful because now I'm talking for the customer and we can't do that. So, I would refer you to what GM has put out. I really can't go any further than that.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum -- AnalystFair enough. As it relates to EBITDA, the bridge on Slide 14 is very helpful, so appreciate that. By my math based on the other guidance that implies kind of the midpoint of guidance assumptions, is it $221 million? If I recall correctly...Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerYes, that's correct.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum -- AnalystOkay. If I recall correctly for accrual accounting for the long term incentives, it requires at least 75% confidence in achieving that. Is that correct? And then does that kind of imply the midpoint is on -- fairly on the conservative side I guess based on that 75% confidence level?Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes. It's actually a good question. It's 70% confidence level that Don and I have to attest to, to the target number of $221 million. And for the accrual purposes for the accounting rules, that's where the plan is capped out. And that's what we accrue true on the long term incentive accrual. So that's why we just maintained it.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum -- AnalystGreat. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThank you.Operator(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Robert W.Baird. Please proceed with your question.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystGood morning, everyone.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, David.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystI want to start with a comment you made about the quarterly pattern and first thanks for sharing it. If what I heard -- if what I heard is correct, you're saying your Q1 revenues are going to be the lowest revenue number for the year, is that right?Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThat's correct.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystYes, well, Q1 is going to also benefit from Grakon where...Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerI'm sorry, David, go ahead.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystGrakon sales I mean is going to -- is going to be added into that number versus last year as well though?Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerOh sure, absolutely.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystWell I touched it off what you said.Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerQ1 tends to be one of our slowest quarters.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystRight. Okay. I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly. And then as we look at this -- the laundry program, is this the timing of this? It's been it seems to be a little bit of a moving target. How confident are you that that's going to hit when you're thinking it's going to start to hit?Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerThat's a very good question because it has been delayed in the past. We're starting to see movement toward launch. There is -- there is -- you can start to see releases and meaningful footprints to the customer hitting their projected launch date which I think is October. So that doesn't mean it doesn't change, but we're starting to see some positive signs. Let's put it that way.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystAnd you're at the point right now where you're ready to go. They just have to say start shipping, right?Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerAbsolutely.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystOkay. And then you also dropped in there on Interface, a commentary about some of the legacy data products. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there? What's the size of that? What's the run off or impact of that?Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerIt's 1 gig transceivers which have been under tremendous price pressure for three, four, five years, if not longer. Ultimately that will wind down. And we're seeing slower sales than we thought maybe even a year ago, 10 gig is improving but not enough to offset the 1 gig product. So, it's noteworthy, it's not going to make a break the year but it was just a worthy of a commentary.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystCan you give us some sense of scale of how large that is for you right now?Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThe two combine about $15 million in sales annually.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystThe one in the 10 combined?Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystOkay.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerFair go, but it could go to 12 or 10.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystAnd then when we look at your sensor business how large is that today in terms of the revenue contribution for you when you take the whole portfolio of sensors?Ronald L.G. Tsoumas -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial Officer$40 million, now going to $20 million to $80 million some, $85 million...Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd we anticipate actually it will go higher to $100 million.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystOkay. And then you didn't make any comments about any new contract wins or anything, any color you can offer there?Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerIt's been relatively slow and we've kind of anticipated that. We have some very good bookings early in '19. And I don't want to say that the automakers are in reuse mode, but that's potentially why we've seen less large -- excuse me -- we had bookings but not enough that we wanted to comment on. We've had lows like this before. One thing I'll comment on is our move into lightning and our EV business has really allowed us to expand our beautiful content, I often say we don't really measure ourselves by what the desire (ph) is doing, we measure by what programs and what our content is. I'll give you two examples I can't name the customers but if we were just looking at HMI business, we'd be in the -- one customer would be in about the $60 per vehicle content and you start to add EV and lighting to that and we're over $122 million in both business.That's the European customer. We've got another European customer, very similar going from $26 per car to $96. So our expansion of the lighting and in our prominence in EVs is definitely helping us with our dollar content per vehicle. But again, nothing to speak of this quarter.David Leiker -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystOkay, great. That's all. Thanks.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, David.OperatorThank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Duda for closing comments.Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerChristine, thank you very much and I'll ask -- I thank everyone for participating today. Have a good day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.Duration: 36 minutesCall participants:Donald W. Duda -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerRonald L.G.
