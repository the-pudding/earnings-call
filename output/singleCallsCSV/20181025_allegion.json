Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered another strong quarter in Q3 and I am pleased with our operational performance which has positioned us well to deliver a solid 2018. Allegion saw strong top line revenue growth in the third quarter with strength across all regions. The Americas saw solid volume in both the non-residential and residential businesses as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals.\nPrice was very strong in the Americas and remained firm (ph) in Europe. Asia-Pacific saw organic growth rebound nicely in the quarter. Acquisitions continued to contribute to total company revenue growth. Electronics growth globally continues to accelerate and was quite substantial during the quarter, led by the Americas region, which saw nearly 30% growth in electronic products during the quarter. We see the electronics growth outlook continuing to be a long-term positive trend as more and more products become connected for ease of access.\nWe are driving price realization and productivity actions in an effort to mitigate the substantial inflationary pressures we are experiencing. We did experience margin declines in the quarter as acquisitions were diluted. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margins were flat year-over-year. I'm very pleased with our ability to manage those inflationary pressures and maintain organic margins through both pricing and cost actions. In the third quarter, we delivered robust EPS growth, seeing more than 20% expansion in adjusted EPS, driven primarily from operations and tax rate benefits. This EPS performance highlights our continued focus on driving increased shareholder value. Last, we are raising our outlook for revenue and EPS. Total revenue growth is projected to be between 13% and 13.5%, raising from our previous range of 12.5% to 13.5%. Organic revenue is being increased to a range of 5% to 5.5%, up from the 4% to 5% provided last quarter. For adjusted EPS, we are raising the range to $4.43 to $4.50 per share, bringing up the low end of our previous outlook, which was $4.35 to $4.50.\nPlease go to Slide 5. In Q3, Allegion delivered strong top line revenue performance. Revenue from the third quarter was $711.5 million, an increase of 16.8%, inclusive of organic growth of 8.5%. Benefits from acquisition also contributed to the top line revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact. All regions grew organically. America led the way with organic growth of just over 10% in the quarter, supported by robust growth in electronics, strong pricing, and solid volume in both the non-residential and residential businesses. The EMEIA region saw organic growth of 3.4% and Asia-Pacific organic growth rebounded nicely coming in at nearly 6%. Adjusted operating margins decreased by 140 basis points due to the dilution related to our acquisitions made earlier this year. Excluding the impact of those acquisitions, the base operating margins were flat year-over-year as the business did a good job of driving price realization and productivity savings to combat continued inflationary pressures. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 increased $0.21, or 20.6%, versus the prior year. The increase was driven by our operational performance and a favorable year-over-year tax rate. Year-to-date available cash flow is up more than $90 million, nearly 68%. The prior year discretionary pension funding payment along with increased earnings are driving the increase.\nPlease go to Slide 6. Electronic growth continues to accelerate. Our global brands continued to innovate to develop smart solutions across residential and non-residential markets. One recent example of such innovation is the SimonsVoss SmartHandle AX which was launched in the third quarter. The SmartHandle AX is a modular handset that leverages the SimonsVoss AX platform. This means, the solution has a flexible design that can adapt to different door variants and global standards while also offering smart features like Bluetooth phone-to-door communication. We are excited that this technology can be leveraged globally because of its adaptability and open architecture. What's more interesting, the Simons -- the SmartHandle AX has an intrinsic security feature to put users minds at ease. It fits seamlessly into existing security hardware environments with retrofit features including door monitoring. At Allegion, innovation in access is an opportunity to put our customers first. Our SimonsVoss SmartHandle AX offers security and compatibility as well as easy installation and extended battery life without compromising design quality.\nPatrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2018 outlook.\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to Slide Number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 8. 5% organic growth in the third quarter. This high organic growth rate reflects outstanding performance in the Americas region, which saw very good price, solid volumes in both the non-residential and residential businesses, and nearly 30% growth in electronic products.\nThe significant growth in electronics occurred in both the residential and non-residential businesses as Allegion continues to be well positioned to take advantage of the industry trend of moving toward electronic locks and connected security solutions. Pricing for Allegion in total was strong in the quarter and more than offset material inflation as the company is taking necessary actions to help mitigate the impact of continued inflationary pressures. Third quarter price realization was strong in our Americas and EMEIA businesses with pricing that was essentially flat in Asia-Pacific. Overall, I was very pleased with the improvement in pricing both year-over-year and sequentially. The pricing performance demonstrates the strength in our brands products and channels. Also, during the third quarter, acquisitions contributed 9% and foreign currency was a slight headwind in all three regions.\nPlease go to Slide Number 8. Reported net revenues for the third quarter were $711.5 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 16.8% versus the prior year, up 8.5% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $149 million increased nearly 10% over the same time frame last year. Adjusted operating margin of 20.9% decreased 140 basis points with the decrease driven by dilution from acquisitions. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were flat year-over-year. Total inflation slightly exceeded price plus productivity as price realization and necessary cost containment actions, which drive productivity, helped mitigate the impact of inflationary headwinds. Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments which had a 50 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. And while acquisitions were dilutive to margins, they were accretive to adjusted earnings per share.\nPlease go to Slide Number 9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2017, reported EPS was $0.94. Adjusting $0.08 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration costs related to acquisitions and charges related to debt refinancing, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.02. Operational results increased EPS by $0.11 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume, and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Favorable year-over-year tax rate drove another $0.10 with the favorability driven primarily by the favorable impact of tax reform, favorable discrete items, and changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Acquisitions contributed $0.02 in the quarter.\nThe combination of interest expense, other income, and non-controlling interest increased earnings per share by $0.01 with favorability from interest offset by the prior year non-operating gains. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.03 reduction. These incremental investments for new product development, channel strategies, and demand creation spending to take advantage of the accelerating electronic products market continue to drive above-market growth and are providing solid returns on our investment. This resulted in adjusted third quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.23, an increase of $0.21 or 20.6% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.02 per share reduction for charges related to acquisitions and restructuring, as well as adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at third quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.21.\nPlease go to Slide Number 10. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $530.1 million, up 16.5% on a reported basis and 10.1% organically. The organic growth was driven by robust growth in electronic products, which came in at nearly 30%. Pricing was also very strong in the quarter, delivering 2.5 points of revenue growth. Both the non-residential and residential businesses saw solid volume performance. The non-residential business grew low double-digits excluding acquisitions. Residential experienced high single-digit growth. Acquisitions added 6.6% growth to total revenue. Americas adjusted operating income of $154.3 million increased 11.4% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 130 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by the dilutive acquisitions. Excluding these acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were down slightly year-over-year as price, productivity, and volume leverage nearly offset the impact of high inflation and headwinds from incremental investments.\nPlease go to Slide Number 11. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $134.4 million, up 7.4% and up 3.4% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter and strength in electronics driven by the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The reported revenue increase was boosted by acquisitions which more than offset currency headwinds. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $10.2 million increased slightly versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 50 basis points, driven by margin dilution from acquisitions. The base business saw margins increase with volume leverage, price, and productivity more than offsetting inflation and incremental investments.\nPlease go to Slide Number 12. Third quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $47 million, up 61.5% versus the prior year. Organic revenue rebounded nicely growing at 5.9% and was volume driven. Total revenue growth was driven by the GWA Door and Access business acquisition. Foreign currency was a headwind for the quarter. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $3.2 million, an increase of $1 million, with adjusted operating margins down 80 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to other regions, dilution from acquisitions drove the margin decline. The base business adjusted operating margins were up slightly with price and productivity more than offsetting the unfavorable impacts from inflation, incremental investments, and mix.\nPlease go to Slide Number 13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2018 was $228.6 million, which is an increase of $92.3 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is driven by the non-recurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017 along with higher net earnings and favorable working capital changes. Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased slightly in the third quarter 2018 when compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million.\nI will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2018 outlook.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide Number 14. As noted on this slide, we are updating revenue outlooks for all regions and for the company as a whole. We are raising total and organic revenue growth in the Americas and lowering total and organic revenue growth outlooks for both Europe and Asia. This results in the consolidated outlook for total revenue increasing to a range of 13% to 13.5% and organic revenue increasing to a range of 5% to 5.5%.\nIf we look closer at the Americas business, end market fundamentals remain solid as evidenced by our third quarter results and we continue to see positive indicators in the non-residential markets with particular strength in institutional verticals, which is expected to continue through 2019. We expect the strong demand for electronic products, especially residential electronic locks to continue as more residential consumers desire connected smart access to their homes.\nEuropean markets are expected to continue to see modest growth driven by electronic products. General European macroeconomic conditions like consumer and business confidence remain positive, but are softening. The GDP in all of our key economies are expanding. In the Asia-Pacific region, we should see solid growth with strengths in electronic products. However, the markets in our Australia and New Zealand businesses have slowed. The total revenue growth for Asia-Pacific will continue to be bolstered by the acquired GWA Door and Access businesses.\nWe expect inflationary pressures to continue for the remainder of the year. The Americas price increase put in place during the quarter has gained good traction and will continue to help mitigate the impacts of inflation. We are raising our reported earnings per share outlook to a range of $4.23 to $4.35, up from $4.15 to $4.35, and we are also raising adjusted earnings per share to $4.43 to $4.50, up from the previous range of $4.35 to $4.50. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%. As Patrick stated, we are also affirming our cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million. The outlook assumes the full year tax rate to be approximately 14.5% and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million. As noted, there is no change to our assumption for investment spend in the outlook. It remains at $0.15 per share.\nPlease go to Slide 15. As a summary of Allegion's Q3 performance, total revenue grew nearly 17%. Organic revenue grew 8.5%. Adjusted operating margins were down 140 basis points and were flat when excluding the impact of acquisitions. Adjusted EPS saw more than 20% growth in the quarter. End market fundamentals in the Americas remain strong.\nNow I and Patrick will be happy to take your questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Maybe a first question around the margin impact of inflation relative to price and productivity. Similar to Q2, it was a slight headwind, I guess, to margins in Q3. How are you thinking about that spread into Q4 and then particularly into next year as tariffs continue to rise?\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, so, Julian, as you indicated, Q3 on a dollars basis, we're a little bit under water, not significantly. So I think the team in aggregate has done a really good job to help mitigate the inflationary headwinds with incremental pricing and you saw the price realization come in extremely strong, particularly in Americas. So really good progress there. As you're aware, we're starting to see the inflation, particularly as it relates to inputs on commodities, to be more stable. And with the incremental price realization, we'd anticipate Q4 to be slightly positive. So we're starting to turn the corner is how I would suggest in Q4. As we look out going forward, the way I would think about it, you really need to look at the components of both price and your assumptions for inflation. As you saw in Q3, outstanding price realization north of 2%, that provides a very good backdrop and tailwind, if you will, in terms of price improvement, particularly in the first half of next year, which you may recall, this year, we only had about a 1% price improvement year-over-year in the first half. So good tailwind there.\nIn inflation, again materials stabilized. So if you assume there's not a big increase relative to the current spot rates, which if you look by the way, whether it'd be steel, brass, or zinc, the current spot rates are anywhere from 10% to 20% lower than the peak spot rates in earlier this year. So I'd expect lower inflation next year. And so what's the net of all this mean? It means that we should see significant improvement in terms of the price/cost dynamic in 2019 going forward and that should help us in margin accretion for next year. I think it sets us up well. One other thing I'll note is that, keep in mind, you're seeing margin dilution from this price/cost dynamic because essentially we're holding flat, offsetting inflation with price. And the tyranny of the math, if you will, suggest that you're going to have margin dilution, maybe not dollars, but certainly margin dilution if you're not getting more than 20% north of your inflation.\nJulian Mitchell -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nThank you. That's very clear. And then my second and last question will just be on the Americas region, in particular noticed the higher investment spend as a headwind in Q3. When you think about the Americas overall as a region, is there anything that in terms of market structure, or competition, or investment requirements that means that your margins have kind of peaked, or do you see a good path still for margin expansion in the medium term in the Americas?\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe still see opportunity for margin expansion, just as I have mentioned getting margin accretion associated with this price inflation dynamic. Also, the incremental margin on volume is still quite strong, 40-plus percent. Don't see any pressure as it relates to pricing that would deteriorate that going forward. And the market fundamental is extremely strong, particularly in Americas. So there's nothing that I could see that would suggest any margin dilution or what peaked on margin going forward. As you think about investments, we will continue to invest in the business. There is opportunities to drive the business faster, I would say, particularly around electronics in terms of demand creation. And we'll continue to look at those opportunities. And there'll be more color provided in next quarter's conference call. But I think we've got good opportunity to continue margin accretion as well as not only in the base business, but the acquisitions as we continue to accelerate those and fold them into our specification writing capabilities. I think that's going provide us good opportunities as well as operational excellence improvements.\nJulian Mitchell -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\nThank you very much.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWelcome.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi, good morning, guys.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nJust maybe to take a step back here for a second. I think at your Analyst Day last year you reiterated your long-term EPS growth algorithm of 10%. And I know there are a lot of moving pieces particularly around price cost and maybe a bit more macro adjective (ph) than we had a quarter or two ago. But, Dave, you talked about still having strong visibility in institutional that that continues into 2019. Is there any reason from what you see today that that shouldn't be still reliable starting point for people to think about that EPS growth algorithm over the next, call it, year plus?\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe stand behind our long term outlook in terms of EPS growth. We were strong this morning in our belief in end markets and especially around the institutional piece, you can look at education, healthcare, and areas that we do well in. I like the outlook for 2019.\nJosh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nRight. And then just a follow-up on electromech. 30% is a big number and I know not the most -- the largest install base out there, the largest base. But anything new either on the product side or new channels that we should think about as maybe that 30% cascades out for a couple of more quarters, something like it?\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think, especially in US res, you see acceleration and because of new entrants, because of things like last mile delivery. But I think the maturity of the keyless world continues to develop globally. We are extremely pleased with our electronic development globally, but a bright line shining on SimonsVoss and Interflex, we think this market has a decade run. And when you start thinking about access as an opportunity, as smart devices, the proliferation of cellphone, smart credentials will redefine access in the next decade. And we think Allegion is in a great position, along with the security industry, to be able to take advantage of that.\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I would just add too, Josh, that if you think about the trend here, this is a -- as we've indicated low penetration on electronic locks in home we'll call it high single digits. And so that provides for a good backdrop for continued growth. And just a reminder that we're not as dependent upon new construction in the resi market. A lot of our sell-through is DIY. And so I just think there's significant opportunity as homes become more connected to accelerate this whole electronics growth. Good secular trend, not as dependent upon new construction going forward.\nJosh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGreat. Appreciate the color, guys.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nHi, good morning.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, John.\nJohn Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nSo wanted to ask a question about the strong free cash flow generation. As we think about the deployment of that and maybe you can give us a little bit of color on how your pipeline looks. Obviously, you've been able to successfully get several deals here done in the year. But how does that look kind of going forward? And do you have the ability to kind of continue to do deals given that you are integrating a few right now, even though they are smaller?\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, number one, pleased with the cash flow generation of the business, especially the core. We challenged our teams in January that we expected better inventory management on the core business and they have done a good job to optimize that and it's showing on the bottom line in terms of cash. Expect us to go in and drive improvements in the acquisition side of what we're acquiring as well. I think, two, when you move (ph) how we'll deploy that cash, the acquisition pipeline continues to be active robust. We did six acquisitions in the first half, so we're in the process of digesting those. But our people continue to develop the relationships that complement that pipeline. I think we're more mindful in terms of access in the future and how electronics software and systems can help leverage our core business. With that said, assets are expensive in the M&A pipeline and we've said that if we can't deploy that cash, we will return it in terms of share buybacks and dividends to our shareholders.\nJohn Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nThank you. And then maybe just following back on an earlier question around tariffs and the outlook going forward. Clearly the spot rate today, obviously if we run the math forward, but how would you contemplate or how would you react if we do see that List 3 kind of increase and as we think about next year?\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So we -- the first point is that we do not have significant exposure on imports from China. It's predominantly on fighter brands, accessories, those type of things because we do a lot of region in-source and manufacturing. So I'd say low exposure from an overall perspective. On the materials that we do import here into the US, we have a couple alternatives to mitigate. One is, find alternative sources of supply which we're working on and two is to mitigate it by a price increase. And with the products that are impacted by the L3, we have already gone out and announced a price increase effective December 1 and to help mitigate that. So when I look at the impact for 2019, I would say the expectation is, it will be offset entirely, i.e. no impact. And then for the balance of this year, minimal impact, if anything.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'd reemphasize, our North American supply chain is local and North American and it gives us some of the best margins in our industry that we continue to focus on to meet customer requirements and drive productivity. We think it's a good setup. We work to try and emulate that globally where we can have competitive supply chains that helped us put up industry-leading margins.\nJohn Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Aurand -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Rob Aurand on for David today.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nRob Aurand -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nI guess, just looking at mix within the Americas, can you talk about kind of the growth you're seeing in the premium brands versus the fighter brands?\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I would say somewhere across the board, premium may be a little bit stronger, particularly as the institutional market is recovering at that. As you know, it's a really good trend from an overall market demand, because we get favorable mix there. Strength across all the brands and product categories, maybe the premium brands doing a little bit better than the fighter brands. But we're seeing good growth particularly as it relates to our channel-led initiative on the discretionary business here in the US, which is more of a lower price point type of product. So, overall, strong growth in all the brands and products.\nRob Aurand -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nAll right. And obviously, your acquisitions are dilutive right now. Can you give us a sense of when could the current acquisitions become accretive to margins?\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo the expectation is that we would begin to see some benefits next year as we continue to integrate those businesses and leverage a little bit more on top line growth. So I would expect some year-over-year improvement. The margin profile of those acquisitions collectively are at the aggregate margins that we see today, but they should begin to show some positive incremental improvement next year if you're looking at it on year-over-year basis.\nRob Aurand -- Longbow Research -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead.\nTim Wojs -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nHey, guys, good morning.\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nTim.\nTim Wojs -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nHey. Just circling back to the electronics growth, just that 30%, that's an organic number?\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes.\nTim Wojs -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nOkay. And then, is there a way just to think about how that is -- how that growth rate kind of compares on the residential side and maybe the commercial side within electronics?\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So we're not going to give specific numbers, but resi a little bit higher than the non-resi piece.\nTim Wojs -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nOkay. And then just my follow-up. You talked about some pretty strong institutional visibility. How about some of the commercial markets as you go into 2019?\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think, it's no secret that the commercial environment has peaked. We still see opportunities in that market. 800 hotel rooms announced last Sunday here in Indianapolis would be an example of that. We think our product positioning gives us the opportunity to continue the growth along with our channel initiatives. But as you think about 2019, healthcare, education look favorable. Our quotation activity looks favorable and we'll continue to take what the commercial market gives us as we move forward.\nTim Wojs -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nGreat. Good luck on the rest of the year, guys. Thanks.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nSee you in a couple of weeks.\nTim Wojs -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nDefinitely.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nRon Jewsikow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nYeah, good morning. This is Ron Jewsikow on for Rich.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nRon Jewsikow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nMorning. Just drilling down a bit further on the M&A dilution in the Americas. Because it was a pretty sizable step up versus last quarter's headwind, we're calculating an operating margin on the acquired business a little under 10%. First, is that correct? And second, what's included in that figure such as the OEM order, (ph) integration cost or anything like that?\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So that would be fairly close. Keep in mind, there is heavy amortization expense associated with intangibles. So really on a cash basis, EBITDA would be mid teens, mid to high teens and so, hey, look, the performance of the business is under a little bit of pressure like we mentioned associated with the base business in terms of higher inflation, those type of things and would expect those businesses, again as that subsides a little bit more to improve margins going forward.\nRon Jewsikow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. Appreciate that color. And then just a follow-up. I know you guys have been hesitant to give this in the past, but given where we are right now I think for resi, can you provide new construction versus rental split or how much of resi sales are direct to the builder channel?\nPatrick Shannon -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Ron, when you look at our residential business, we're more aftermarket than new construction. So definitely north of 50% is aftermarket, the biggest channel being through big box retailers. We don't give the exact amount, but as you think of our business, it's not as tied to newbuild at all.\nRon Jewsikow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. Appreciate that. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Kessler -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst\nThank you. At the last -- at the GSX Conference where you folks demonstrated some of your new products and businesses, one of the things that we spent a long time on was your Overtur spec writing system. To the extent that you can talk about it, number one, what is the game plan in terms of integrating existing, let's call it, organic company with new acquisitions into that spec, if you want to call it, collaborative spec writing capability? And number two, what markets do you think that this new system will affect first as we take a look at what seems to be a technology step ahead of the competition?\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo thanks for pointing out our development of Overtur. It's a system that helps our spec writers connect with architects and designers. It's something that we've been developing over the last year here at Allegion. Number one, look for us to expand that into acquisitions integrations as we move forward. Number two, if you think about the world of specification, especially with architects, new architects entering the space expect to be connected digitally. And we think Overtur is a nice step up for that. It provides features that drive the efficiencies in terms of the design and project management and it will help us put, what I would describe, hooks in that design phase and build on the competitive advantage that already exists. Allegion, particularly in the Americas, has one of the strongest spec writing capabilities and investing in the digital tools to advance the right step. We like our position there.\nJeffrey Kessler -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst\nOkay. Also, if I could just ask a question about one of the smaller acquisitions that you made, a company that we've worked with in the past, ISONAS. They are known for essentially having, if you want to call, their power reader controllers, basically supplanting one big box that you had to put at the door. What markets are you -- are they or are you in conjunction now working toward to start introducing that product through Allegion?\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo I don't know that I'd want to show my hand there. But we believe, around the institutional markets, advancing our wireless access technologies that that's a perfect fit for us. And you think about the sets of products that we have in terms of wireless access design, we like how that can advance us in our growth in that segment Jeff.\nJeffrey Kessler -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst\nOkay. I don't have a third question to ask, so -- but I will get you guys back on this later. Thank you very much.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe you can appreciate that I just don't want to throw my cards on the table there.\nJeffrey Kessler -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst\nI understand that. Okay.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nMike Wagnes -- Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations\nAndrew, do we have another caller in the queue?\nOperator\nYes. We do have a question from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, guys.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Joseph.\nJoe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nHey. So just talking about that 30% growth in electronics this quarter, obviously nice uptick. Maybe if you could maybe just provide a little bit more color, what do you think is really driving that growth? Is this kind of like a new normal? Just any color around whether it's product introductions or different channels that you're selling through would be helpful.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo I'd point to a couple areas. Number one, overall broad awareness, last mile delivery, smart doorbells, all starts with dialog, does your front door connect as well as my front door. I think, second is the advancement of e-commerce whether it's Home Depot, Amazon, our e-commerce channels are growing extremely nicely. And this is a click-and-play type product. I think our brand is significant here. There's been some research out in the market that talks about the importance of brand awareness in the market and we think the Schlage brand are star ratings. If you look into some of that, the highest star ratings with the most reviews on our products are things that line up nicely for Allegion.\nJoe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nNo, that makes sense, Dave. And maybe since you brought it up, just any color you can give on Amazon Key, your product introductions, I think you're still scheduled for later this year? Any update on that would be helpful.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe will have a product available eminently that's compatible with Amazon Key. That was our commitment and we're there.\nJoe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Thanks, guys.\nDavid Petratis -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me add a little bit to that. We are compatible with a variety of operating systems and we'll have a release in this quarter that connects with a world that's moving all the time.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks.\nMike Wagnes -- Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations\nWe would like to thank everyone for participating in today's call.
