A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in today's press release on our Investor Relations website.\nAt this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bryan Murray.\nBryan Murray -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Christopher, and thank you, everyone for joining today's call. Results for the first quarter of 2019 came in at the high end of our guidance range for net revenue and slightly above the range in non-GAAP operating margin.\nOur success was driven by the Orbi lines of mesh WiFi systems, the Nighthawk Pro Gaming line, cable modems and gateways, and our SMB switching portfolio. Overall NETGEAR net revenue for the first quarter ended March 31st, 2019 was $249.1 million, which is up 1.6% on a year-over-year basis and down 13.8% on a sequential basis. Sequential decline is primarily due to typical seasonality as consumer spending slows following the holiday season.\nLooking at net revenue by geography. We generated $148 million of net revenue in the Americas, which is down 7.5% year-over-year and down 22.2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year drop in North America was due to reduced service provider sales. In Q1 the U.S. retail WiFi market declined 8% relative to the prior year comparable period.\nThis was primarily due to the accelerated decline of the 11ac router market excluding the gaming category. Despite this we were able to achieve our forecasted revenue for North America driven by new product introductions. It is incumbent upon us to return the market to growth in order for us to be able to achieve our financial goals including exiting the fourth quarter at 11% to 12% non-GAAP operating margin. Patrick will comment in a moment on how we hope to achieve this.\nNet revenue for EMEA was $57 million, which is up 20.1% year-over-year and down 3.1% quarter-over-quarter. We experienced healthy year-over-year growth in both the service provider and non-service provider channels in EMEA. Furthermore, we saw increased orders from our U.K. partners in anticipation of the originally scheduled Brexit deadline for March 29 in an effort to mitigate potential supply interruptions.\nAPAC net revenue was $44.1 million for the first quarter, which is up 16.8% from the prior year comparable quarter and up 10.8% quarter-over-quarter. Growth in APAC was driven by the service provider channel. For the first quarter of 2019, we shipped a total of approximately 3.8 million units including 2.5 million nodes of wireless products. Shipments of all wired and wireless routers and gateways combined were about 1.4 million units for the first quarter of 2019.\nThe net revenue split between home and business products was about 68% and 32% respectively. The net revenue split between wireless and wired products was about 64% and 36% respectively. Products introduced in the last 15 months constituted about 27% of our first quarter shipments, while products introduced in the last 12 months contributed to about 23% of our first quarter shipments.\nWe expect to see improvement here in the quarters ahead given our new product introductions planned for the remainder of the year. From this point on, scheduled (ph) points will focus on non-GAAP numbers. The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP detailed in our earnings release distributed earlier today.\nThe non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter of 2019 was 33.3%, which is up 180 basis points year-over-year compared to 31.5% in the prior year comparable quarter and up 150 basis points compared to 31.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018. We are pleased with the improvement that we've seen in gross margin lines in recent quarters.\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $60.2 million, which is down 9.9% year-over-year and down 6.6% sequentially. As always we manage our expenses prudently, while providing the growth areas of our business the resources necessary to succeed.\nOur non-GAAP R&D expense for the first quarter was 7.1% of net revenue as compared to 8.2% of net revenue in the prior-year comparable period and 6.2% of net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018. R&D investment remains critical to the future success of our business and we will continue to invest here in the quarters to come. Our headcount decreased by a net of nine people during the quarter landing at 828 as of March 31st.\nOur non-GAAP tax rate was 16.5% in the first quarter of 2019. The better-than-expected tax rate for the quarter resulted from the settlement of a foreign tax audit that was accounted for as a discrete benefit during the quarter. Looking at the bottom line for Q1. We reported non-GAAP net income of $19.8 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.60 per diluted share.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter of 2019 with $212.7 million in cash. As expected during the quarter we used $37.2 million in cash flow in continuing operations. As a result of working capital needs to help support our manufacturing migration out of China in the first half of the year to mitigate imposed tariffs. Additionally, we used $6 million in purchase of property and equipment during the quarter.\nWe remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful levels of cash. In Q1, we spent $15 million to repurchase approximately 436,000 shares of NETGEAR common stock at an average price of $34.41 per share. Since the start of our repurchase activity in Q4 2013, we have repurchased approximately 12.8 million shares.\nOur fully diluted share count is approximately 32.9 million shares as of the end of the first quarter. There are one million shares remaining under our approved buyback program and we plan to opportunistically repurchase our stock in the quarters to come.\nNow turning to the results of our product segments. The Connected Home segment, which includes the industry-leading Nighthawk, Orbi, Nighthawk Pro Gaming, and Meural brands generated net revenue of $169.4 million during the quarter, which is down 2.8% on a year-over-year basis and down 21.5% sequentially.\nThe year-over-year decline is due to reduced service provider revenue for Connected Home, which was down $5 million from the first quarter of 2018. The sequential decline reflects normal post-holiday seasonality with the added effect of two fewer selling days from Q4 to Q1.\nWe held our U.S. consumer WiFi market share at 50% in the first quarter of 2019. The SMB segment generated net revenue of $79.7 million for the first quarter of 2019, which is up 12.5% on a year-over-year basis and up 8.8% sequentially. Our PoE+ and ProAV switching line continue to perform well. Additionally, we benefited from extra shipments for the U.K. and anticipation of the Brexit deadline, which ultimately was delayed.\nI'll now turn the call over to Patrick for his commentary after which I will provide guidance for the second quarter of 2019.\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Bryan, and hello, everyone. As Bryan just highlighted, we had a strong Q1 led by Orbi, Nighthawk, Pro Gaming, cable models and gateways and our SMB switches. Additionally, we began rolling out the first wave of Mini WiFi 6 products to the market. Extended NETGEAR Armor to the Orbi platform. Continued rolling out Meural to new channel partners and growing as content library.\nThat means successfully recruiting ProAV installers and have made significant progress in converting our installed base to registered users and increasing the number of registered app downloads. I'd like to thank everyone at NETGEAR for making so many amazing things happen in such a short amount of time.\nDuring the quarter as mentioned by Bryan we saw the 11ac router market decelerate at a higher-than-expected rate. This poses significant risk to our growth trajectory in the second half of this year. As a result we're taking strong proactive steps to mitigate this. U.S. consumer WiFi market declined approximately 8% year-over-year compared to being flat year-over-year in Q4 2018.\nGrowth in the mesh system and gaming routers was unable to fully offset the decline in 11ac routers. As the market leader in consumer WiFi was 50% market share in the U.S. It's up to us to reverse this trend. We must stimulate demand with new technology.\nAnd therefore we've aggressively introduced two additional models of WiFi 6 routers at the end of first quarter. Additionally, we recently announced the super-premium Nighthawk Tri-band WiFi 6 routers coming in May. By next month, we'll have four premium WiFi 6 routers on the market ranging in prices from $199 to $599 which provide a lineup of good better best and elite.\nWe will be driving early adoption of these products with increased installed marketing spend in the second quarter, which we believe will kick start the transition to WiFi 6. Just as new and much anticipated WiFi 6 enabled smartphones and laptops are hitting the market. We believe this will establish NETGEAR as the early leader in WiFi 6.\nOur channel partners are aligned with us in this strategy and are looking to NETGEAR to lead the market in this push. Reversing the current market trend is a necessary for us to deliver mid single-digit growth in the second half of 2019 and to exit the year at double-digit operating margins. New WiFi 6 technology clearly is the best tool to entice consumer demand.\nWhile turning the market around will be a challenge. We remain optimistic given the strength of our product lineup coming in the remainder of 2019. Beyond the full WiFi 6 Nighthawks hitting the market in the first half. We will be refreshing the rest of the Nighthawk portfolio with WiFi 6 in the rest half of the year allowing us to address every price point in the market.\nFurthermore our WiFi 6 Orbi Mesh products will come to market in the second half of 2019 and future Marvell models. On the cable side of the business, we are going to continue to push our product line forward with two technology inflections. The shift from DOCSIS 3.0 to 3.1 and move from 11ac to WiFi 6. Clearly we have a lot to look forward to in the product pipeline for the year ahead.\nGaming routers continue to be a growth area in consumer WiFi. During the quarter, we debuted the latest addition to our family of Nighthawk Pro Gaming routers at ISC West 2019. The Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR300 is designed to minimize ping and latency no matter what the consumer's gaming preference is. It would be Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, PC or mobile devices.\nAt just $199 it routs out our Nighthawk Pro Gaming portfolio with good better and best. So, that we now address all types of gamers from the casual to the hardcore. We continue to view gaming as a significant growth opportunity and will continue to invest in this category.\nThe mesh systems also continue to be a growth area in consumer WiFi. Our folks article published this March wrote that. There is no denying that NETGEAR's hardware is top of the line. If you need a strong reliable fast signal. Orbi is worth the money. At Costco, we recently wrote out Orbi with one year or about a month cybersecurity solutions one note into the offering.\nI look forward to seeing user renewals after the first year of service. We plan to expand this new category of armor bundled products with more models in more channels throughout the rest of the year. We are excited about the potential of any large number of service subscribers to our installed base with bundled solutions such as these.\nRounding our CHP, we recently added a digital marketplace to the Meural content library. So, now Meural users can purchase and own individual pieces and playlists of world renowned art and photography that they can display exclusively on the Meural digital campuses in their homes.\nWe also continue to grow the content available from Meural and have recently added work from prominent artists like Norman Rockwell, Georgia O'Keeffe, Keith Haring, Frida Kahlo and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Meural is currently carried in Bloomingdale's plus views and over 20 experiential stores worldwide.\nDuring the second quarter we will be launching the new 21-inch Meural of a lower price volume for consumers versus our current 27-inch canvas, which we are very excited about. Meanwhile our SMB segment had a fantastic Q1, growing 12.5% year-over-year. We saw growth in both switching and wireless LAN during the quarter and are particularly pleased with the growth we have seen in ProAV and PoE+ switching.\nOur market share in switches sold through the U.S. retail channel was strong at 38% in Q1. We continue to see ProAV switching as a tremendous opportunity. We have been hard at work recruiting AV installers expanding our channel with global AV equipment manufacturers such as Savant ZeeVee and Aurora. Our M4300 switches are helping a growing number of AV installers transition from 1080p HD-base TV to 4K SDVoE.\nWe're excited about the growth potential here as 2020 Olympics will broadcast 100% in 4K video. We are heading the world's transition from 1080p to 4K video. You can expect more ProAV switches from us in the second half of 2019.\nAcross NETGEAR we are making progress toward doing recurring revenue streams. This is an initiative that we expect will have a significant impact on our bottom line and the stability of earnings in the future. As of the end of the first quarter we have 10.4 million registered users, which represent approximately 40% of our installed base.\nOur registered app user account has grown to two million, which is over 200% growth in the short six months since September 2018. We currently have nine services available on the market and are continuing to role services out across our product portfolio. We remain bullish on the value creation opportunity of our service initiative.\nOn the service provider side, we had a good Q1 and about $38 million of sales. However, two of our major service provider customers significantly called now the demand for 4G mobile hotspot in Q2. For the tune of approximately $13 million as they are balancing their inventory in preparation for the intending rollout of 5G.\nAs you know service provider sales have always been lumpy. I would believe that we will be able to recover in the second half of 2019 and maintain our full year target of $140 million of service provider net revenue.\nI will now turn the call back to Bryan for second quarter guidance.\nBryan Murray -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Patrick. As just mentioned our current quarter forecast for service provider revenue is expected to be down approximately $13 million sequentially. With Q2 seasonality and the aforementioned WiFi market slowdown, our second quarter forecast net revenue is expected to be in the range of $215 million to $230 million.\nGiven this decline in our top line and the increased marketing spend for our WiFi 6 initiatives, our Q2 GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 0% to 1% and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 4% to 5%.\nOur GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 28.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 23.5% for the second quarter of 2019. We expect our operating margin will significantly improve in the second half when service provider revenue and marketing spend should both return to normal levels.\nWith strong new product introduction and a big marketing push in Q2 we hope to return the WiFi retail market to flat or slight growth in the second half of the year. Thus making possible our objective of growing mid-single digits in the second half of 2019 relative to the second half of 2018.\nWe hope to exit the fourth quarter delivering GAAP operating margins of 8% to 9% and non-GAAP operating margin of 11% to 12% and deliver double-digit non-GAAP operating margin for the second half of 2019.\nOperator, that concludes our comments and we can now take questions.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nWhy Netgear Stock Plunged Today\n\n\nLight Guidance Overshadows Netgear's Latest Quarterly Beat\n\n\nWhy Netgear Stock Fell Today\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks, and good afternoon. I just wanted to start on service provider. I understand it can be lumpy, but I think you've talked about. In the past you typically get line of sight maybe six or 12 months out. So, I'm just hoping to understand maybe first what changed in the level of visibility there? And why you are confident that it comes back so quickly? Is it contractual? Is there anything you can help us with? And does it get to the $35 million to $40 million in Q3 for that you've talked about in the past?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, you hit around the head, I mean, the visibility about six to 12 months out, but it's lumpy. They could order more one quarter, not in the other quarter. So, that's why in the longer-term perspective we still believe that we are in the $35 million quarter range, which we confirmed just now. It's just that they now -- they want less inventory on the 4G and later on, I mean, they would replenish that and we'll supplement it with 5G inventories as we can see it in the next six months.\nAdam Tindle -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nOkay. So, with that coming down, do you think that should help margins from a mix standpoint, but operating margin for 2Q is probably 500 or 600 basis points below what we would have thought. Obviously, there are other variables here, the increase in marketing spend. So, just hoping, you can maybe help us quantify this? How much of the impact from that? Where does it hit? Is it contra revenue and then the timing to normalization? Does that spend continue in Q3 and come out by Q4? Just a quantity where it hits in the timings to normalization?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, as a matter of fact, I mean, we've been pretty successful in the last few years to correct the possibility of our service provider business, which actually is equal if not better. I think the profitability than the non-service provider channel. So, a smaller portion or a downward drive on the service provider revenue doesn't really increase the profitability because it's similarly profitable for the rest of the business.\nAnd we do believe that in the Q2 we mentioned that the loss of leverage, I mean, it's all of a sudden the top line drop so much. We cannot adjust our operating expenses. So, that much is by keeping operating expenses flat. That is cutting half of the shortfall and the other half you're right is really contra revenue marketing that we're going to spend.\nSo, we are going to have in app, I mean, on the web, banner pages, and more via the marketing tools on online in caps, in the stores all those are contra revenue exercises that we're going to pay for. We believe that it's necessary because by doing more of that, we get WiFi 6 more in front of people, and when people step up from, let's say, a 11ac router, which they normally would pay $149 into 11ax router which would, they pay for $199 or the other case is 11ac router they pay for $249 and step up they pay for $399 11ax router that will basically lift ASP pretty significantly.\nAs we have been doing that in the last three, four years, right, our major tool to expand the market keep the market from declining is not by reversing the unit decline, it's basically by boosting the ASP. So, that strategy we believe has worked for us in the last five, six years and it should work for us in the next few quarters.\nAdam Tindle -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nOkay. And Patrick I just kind of maybe continue on that side. I know you tend to be very thoughtful about spending and kind of continuing your thought on the increased marketing spend. Are there key quantitative metrics or results that you're looking to drive on the other side of this to justify this as a good investment? Is there a certain level of revenue growth or just give us a view on why it's important for us to hang in there for the other side of this dip?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I mean, for us, I mean, it's important to understand we own 50% of the North America WiFi retail market. So, you can safely say we are the market. So, that means if the market doesn't grow, it's certainly would basically, I mean, our line is pretty difficult to grow it all.\nSo, it is upon us and so as we said the channel look to us. Clearly, reverse the channel of the market. And as any tech company leaders, I mean, the only way to reverse the trend is by introducing some exciting new products that people open the wallet for.\nSo, I think, a good measure of whether this marketing push and these new product introduction that we do the market will actually have the positive effect that we see, it's to see where the market returns to flat slight growth rather than 8% decline year-over-year and that's a good metric. Because seriously if the market contract 8% and we own 50% of the market for us to grow 5% year-over-year that's a pretty tall alter.\nAdam Tindle -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nRight. I guess one quick one if I can get one in for Bryan. You mentioned you're confident in generating meaningful cash. Obviously, you have the short-term reset here and the stocks indicated down meaningfully. Maybe just talk about how you're thinking about buybacks from here? Is there any prohibiting you from stepping up the level of buybacks? I know you did the $15 million in the quarter but just kind of a potential elevated level if you're confident in the more intermediate term where the market seems to doubting you based on the after-hours?\nBryan Murray -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, the cash for the first quarter is kind of directionally what we had said back in February that we expected to consume some cash in relation to the inventory movement, and moving the manufacturing out of China. So, we're pleased with that and we expect that to be online with what we said. In terms of buyback, we will remain optimistic buyers of the stock and we've said that consistently.\nAdam Tindle -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Woo Jin Ho of Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nWoo Jin Ho -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. Patrick, as you look into the second half, you still going to acquire a fair amount of 802.11ac volume to hit better retail numbers. I mean what's your confidence that you can actually see an uptick in demand in 802.11ac in addition to your WiFi 6 efforts?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, basically, our focus on stimulating the market is really getting people to move into the newer categories. So, we have the newer categories such as Orbi right Orbi is 11ac primarily, but we strengthen that with 11ax Orbi in the second half. Orbi is absolutely a growth you know factor and it could accelerate the growth of that with the addition of the 11ac that will help the market.\nAnd then with 11ax I just mentioned one for one. Every 11ac purchase, if it turns into a 11ax purchase, it's automatically increase the volume by a third. The dollar volume by a third. That was pretty significant. So, even if only a third of the people who intended to buy ac router become an ax router. We can strengthen the market we don't need to have a declining market.\nAnd then on the 11ac front, I think, another growth area we have is the gaming router, which we are the only game in town and that's growing really robustly. And we just introduce another 11ac gaming router which takes out $300 at $199, of course, putting high price point compared to an ordinary 11as router, but again one more gamers who will convert in to that gaming router that again step up of about a third of the ASP, and we do believe that at $199 versus the ongoing $299 entry price point will entice quite a bit of people stepping into the gaming router RAM.\nSo, we feel pretty confident that with all these, there's got to be some movement in the market. And we certainly hope that moment will entail the market back in the flat line of slight growth rather than the 8% decline that we saw in Q1, which is certainly is not planned because through last year it wasn't like that.\nWoo Jin Ho -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst\nAll right. And then in terms of WiFi 6 competitive landscapes. I know there are a handful of vendors who are out there. However you channel distribution is unparalleled, I mean, do you expect to maintain that leadership and flip the market with WiFi 6 products in the second half? I mean we've already seen multiple SKUs, but is that the strategy that you're trying to deploy?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThat's exactly what we said in the second half. We'll refresh the entire line of the 11ac routers with WiFi 6 at all price points. So, if you look at that, right, we already own three to four space -- show space for our WiFi 6 router and coupled with a new gaming router and then coupled with the 11ax Orbi coming out there isn't much move our competitors getting in show space.\nWoo Jin Ho -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst\nAll right. And in terms of the mobile hotspot in the service provider opportunity here you have your 5G hotspot with one service provider. Is that in terms of the improvement in service provider in the second half more along the lines of the expansion to other service providers or is it channel refresh with one particular service provider?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nNo. We do believe that the current 5G deployment is relatively limited because the coverage is very, very limited. And the initial model of the chipset from Qualcomm as well as accompanying system that we produce are pretty expensive. So, the next generation of 5G mobile hotspot with a more extended network that will really enable the uptick of the 5G mobile hotspot and we expect more than one operators will roll out, 5G mobile hotspot toward the end of the year.\nWoo Jin Ho -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst\nGot it. And then one last one for me in terms of the second half margin commentary. How much of that is going, well, I understand that the revenue is going to be the principal lever here, but do you expect a gross margin improvement 33.3% for the first quarter is fairly nice for you guys. Is that going to be something that is sustainable going forward?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, we tried to focus everybody on operating margin rather than gross margin because the gross margin is a fact that whether we do contra revenue marketing or we just do TV advertising. So, I think, it's the bottom line that's important.\nWe've done the financial models and in the second half -- indeed the market kind of retract from negative 8% decline to a more favorable environment then we feel pretty confident that we will be able to deliver double-digit operating margin.\nNow within that framework, I mean, how we're going to spend marketing dollars. How we're going to do the product mix will have a significant impact on the gross margin. So we rather not focus on the gross margin, but on the operating margin.\nWoo Jin Ho -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) And our final question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nHamed Khorsand -- BWS Financial -- Analyst\nHey, just first want to start off with the comment you said earlier about the Brexit Partners the concern there. It's not showing up on your distribution channel line right? And so is it -- was it all service provider related?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nNo. It's a distributor related in the UK. We do not split out the distributors by country. So, it's currently lumped into. It's lumped into the overall European distribution, yes.\nHamed Khorsand -- BWS Financial -- Analyst\nCorrect. But it's down from 4.1 it's now 4.0, it was 4.1 in December. So, that's one of the...\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThat means somebody is not taking enough inventory like the Germans.\nHamed Khorsand -- BWS Financial -- Analyst\nAnd then that's what I was trying to get to is like much of this is balancing act in Q2 with the guidance you're getting?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, I mean, we have taken that into account. We certainly have to help the distributor, but then again Brexit is not going our way, I mean, they are talking about May. So, they're not going to. They're going to hold onto the inventory until Brexit is a little bit clearer.\nHamed Khorsand -- BWS Financial -- Analyst\nAnd is there, I mean, I would imagine we have some controls over there. Are you monitoring that situation, so you're not too expose to something like this from a lumpiness standpoint?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, I mean, I think by managing overall distribution channel inventory then we know how to smooth it out, right. We certainly have no control on Brexit.\nHamed Khorsand -- BWS Financial -- Analyst\nAnd then on your commentary about the WiFi slowdown is much of that anything to do with Amazon buying Eero at all and having impact in your business?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, I mean, Eero transaction wasn't closed until end of March. So, they had no effect, and further more Eero\ndoesn't play in the 11ac quarter market, they are mostly in the mesh market. So, our suspicion is more like people waiting for WiFi 6, right. They basically say, jeez, there's a big technology transition going on. It is pretty much like a long period in August, September for iPhone sales that people waiting for the new iPhones to launch.\nHamed Khorsand -- BWS Financial -- Analyst\nAnd my follow-up question is just given that there is this transition going on. Are you exposed to having to discount inventory a lot from here?\nPatrick Lo -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nNo. I mean we have been managing inventory quite well. So, we certainly hope not, right. Our operations team is first rate and then they have been very successful. And so we believe that we don't need to discount significantly and that's why we just say that we're focusing on really getting WiFi 6 to be very successful enticing consumer demand get the markets back to flat or slight growth and then we'll have a very good second half.\nHamed Khorsand -- BWS Financial -- Analyst\nOkay.
