Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim King. Please go ahead, sir.\nJim King -- Head of Investor Relations\nThank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining to discuss our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. With me here in Marysville, Ohio this morning is Jim Hagedorn, our Chairman and CEO; Randy Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Lukemire, our President and COO; as well as several other members of our management team. We'll get started in a moment with prepared remarks from Jim and Randy. Afterward, we will open the call to your questions. (Operator Instructions) One bit of housekeeping before we move forward, next Tuesday November 13, Randy and I will be participating in a Morgan Stanley Global Consumer and Retail Conference at the Crown Plaza Times Square in New York.\nWe'll be participating in a webcast Q&A session at 8:00 a.m. that day. However, there's no formal presentation available(ph) for this conference, so there will be no materials related to the event that are posted on our website. With that let's move on to today's call. As always we expect to make forward-looking statements this morning, so I want to caution you that our actual results could differ materially from what we say here today. Investors should familiarize themselves with the full range of risk factors that can impact our results, which are filed in our Form 10-K with the SEC. And I also want to remind everyone that today's call is being recorded and an archived version of the call will be available later today on our website. With that, let's get things started. And I'll turn things over to Jim Hagedorn.\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll get right to the point. I'm glad that fiscal 2018 is behind us. In fact, it's probably not been since 2012 that I've been as relieved as I was this year to turn the page. But I have a much different mindset today than I did back then. That year, our performance ultimately led us down a path to adjust our strategy and to reconfigure the company. I see 2018 through a far different lens. The result of our reconfiguration has left us with a stronger portfolio. Categories like hydroponics, rodenticide and live goods have far better long-term growth potential even if some of them took a step backwards last year.\nAdditionally, today we're a company with better margin and cash flow potential, metrics that ultimately drive shareholder value. The factors that impacted us in 2018 were mostly external and mostly beyond our control and have done nothing to diminish my confidence in our overall strategy. But confidence is one thing, results are another. So I'm not going to sit here and make excuses all morning. We understand the job ahead of us and that's to execute, to make up lost ground and to drive better outcome for our shareholders, our associates and all of our stakeholders.\nAs we enter fiscal 2019, we have a lot of things working in our favor. In the United States consumer business, we have innovation on our side next year with new organic products in both the gardening and weed control categories. We also were successful in getting price increases where we're seeking to cover commodity and distribution inflation as well as higher planned investments in people and brands. Additionally, our line reviews were successful and we expect strong support of our brands again next year by our retail partners in all channels for trade.\nIn Hawthorne, the integration to Sunlight is on schedule and we expect to achieve 100% of the synergies we've discussed in the past. We remain optimistic that Hawthorne will return to growth in the months ahead and both the social and political environment continues to improve. Just yesterday, Utah, Missouri and Michigan voted to broaden authorized cannabis use. Additionally, we believe the change of leadership in the United States House of Representatives enhances the likelihood for more compromised federal legislation that will make it easier for companies to navigate the cannabis market in states where its production, sale and use has become legal.\nTo a greater degree than most of you probably realized, we've been a leading voice at all levels of government in shaping policy discussions. At the federal level, in particular, I'm confident in saying that our engagement has helped sway opinions in both political parties and we look forward to continuing our dialogue with the incoming House leadership team. From a financial perspective, we're confident we can get our earnings back on track in 2019. We will also continue to improve our working capital management with the goal of another strong year of cash flow performance. I'll come back to all these points in a few moments. But first let me put a wrap on 2018.\nI want to start by recognizing the efforts of the entire team in our U.S. consumer business. We finished the year with consumer purchases of our products flat on a year-over-year basis at our top four retailers. That alone was a big win given the delay we saw across nearly the entire country at the start of the lawn and garden season. In the home center and hardware channels combined, POS increased by nearly 3%. As you may recall, POS for the entire U.S. business was down 15% in mid-April. When the weather finally broke, the lawn and garden season also broke and it broke hard.\nWe went on a six-week midseason tear across all categories that was unprecedented. By the end of the year, we have positive POS numbers in branded fertilizer, grass seed, soils, mulch, live goods and rodenticides. Once again innovation made a big difference. Our lawns category enjoyed the best innovation year in more than a decade due to the success of Scotts Turf Builder Triple Action products as well as Turf Builder Thick' R. As a result, our branded fertilizer business increased nearly 2% this year despite the slow start to the early part of the season. We also maintained our aggregate market share. I know some of you have been asking questions about the battle against private labels, so let me address the issue head on.\nPrivate label has always been our primary competitor in key categories like lawn fertilizer and growing media. This is nothing new, neither is the fact that we're winning. Investors often ask why we've been able to compete effectively against private label. There are two primary reasons. First, in a category where performance is critical, our products outperform the private label. We know that and so do our consumers. That's why continued innovation matters so much in this space. Second, because of our strong relationship with consumers, our brands drive foot traffic into stores. We know that and so do our retail partners. That's why we continue to invest heavily in both advertising and trade programs. Before I move on to discuss Hawthorne, I know many of you have questions about Roundup and the implications of the San Francisco jury verdict during the quarter. Here's what you need to know. First, I want to stress that we are committed to the Roundup brand and the consumer Roundup business. We also continue to believe fully that glyphosate containing Roundup-branded products are safe for consumers when used as directed. The body of science evaluating the active ingredient glyphosate is immense and that scientific record supports the safety.\nThat's why US EPA and major regulatory agencies around the world have approved its use. If I felt any different, then we would not continue to serve as Bayer's marketing agent for consumer Roundup. Our relationship with the Bayer's since the Monsanto transaction closed has been a productive one. We respect their role as the owner of the brand and they respect our understanding of the consumer marketplace. Second, it's obvious that the scientific evidence supporting glyphosate safety has not prevented Bayer from facing a groundswell of litigation.\nI also want you to know that the litigation issues are theirs not ours. And we are indemnified for any glyphosate litigation in our role as their marketing agent. Third, consumer purchases of Roundup since the verdict have actually been positive. We acknowledge that sales in this period may not be fully representative as it covers the time of the year when consumers aren't buying a lot of weed killers. Still, we're carefully monitoring consumer sentiment for brand reputation or other sides of headwind. Fourth, in the event the Roundup brand reputation or performance would see a significant decline, our agreements provide for potential remedies. And fifth, the diversity of our product offerings serves us well. To the extent that negative publicity might discourage certain consumers, we have other options available under our own brands in the nonselective weed control category.\nI don't want to provide too many details this morning other than to say we're introducing our own Ortho GroundClear nonselective weed control product. This is a product that is certified for use in organic gardens and does an outstanding job especially on patios, sidewalks and driveways. We have the only US EPA registration for the ready-to-use application of this product. It's worth stressing that we could have introduced older synthetic chemicals but we like the idea of further expanding our organic product line. Our consumer data tell us that our nonselective weed control product that has an organic certification will have a great deal of appeal and will be a welcome complement to the existing nonselective products and actually expand the category.\nWith that, let me switch gears and address the most recent results of Hawthorne as well as some encouraging signs we've seen of late. Overall, sales increased 65% in the quarter, obviously, most of that growth was driven by the Sunlight deal. However, AeroGrow grew more than 50% and our European professional horticulture business increased by more than 30%. North American Hydro business was down approximately 30% when making certain adjustments to create an apples-to-apples comparison but there are some underlying facts here that are encouraging. First of all, the overall rate of decline has improved. When we make the same adjustments to Q3, the decline was nearly 40%. Randy will elaborate on this point in a few minutes. Second, remember that the fourth quarter of 2017 for Hawthorne included an extremely difficult comp of more than 30%.\nThird, the average daily shipments we've seen over the past several months has been steadily improving. If those trends continue, we should start seeing positive growth again in the new calendar year. Fourth, we've made solid progress over the past several months as our business and customer base continues to evolve. We've upgraded our sales force and put a more intense focus on Canada than ever before. And fifth, the integration of Sunlight is on plan and we expect to see 100% of our expected synergies to materialize by the end of fiscal 2019. I don't want to suggest we've totally turned the corner because we still have work to do.\nThere is a strong possibility that December quarter will also show negative top line results. But based on the current trends, we currently believe will be back in positive territory sometime during the March quarter, which is our Q2. In discussing Hawthorne, I want to briefly revisit comments I made during our previous call. During the Q&A session, I referred to the team as gun-shy. Some of you interpreted those comments to suggest a lack of confidence in the team and in the business. Rest assured, that's not the case. Here's what I was getting at. After unexpected declines in the first halves of 2018, we asked the team for an updated plan for the second half of the year. Those forecasts also missed the mark. This was frustrating for all of us and I know our shareholders were frustrated as well. The team reacted the same way I would have. They became even more conservative in their planning assumptions over the past several months. Their confidence in the business is unaffected and the same goes for me but over promising at this stage of the game just doesn't help anyone. But that doesn't mean we're sitting back and just waiting for recovery to come to us. We're getting after it and hard. Since our last call, we've made further organizational leadership changes at Hawthorne primarily in sales, marketing and strategic planning. Additionally, Chris Hagedorn and several of his direct reports are now based in Ohio not New York or Portland.\nThis allows them to more fully and easily leverage the assets of the entire organization whether it's marketing, legal, HR, finance, supply chain or Mike Lukemire or myself. I want to reiterate my confidence in this team, the portfolio we've built and the opportunities that lie ahead of us for this business. While the market was clearly softer than we expected in 2018, we still made great progress. Our product portfolio got stronger, so did our supply chain, so did our data systems and so did the team. I'd just remind everyone that it was only a year ago when we're seeing organic volume growth of more than 30%. We've talked several times on these calls about the overproduction of cannabis in the West Coast and the resulting pressure on legally authorized production. Several media reports have since validated our remarks.\nWe've also talked about the undue regulatory burden that took effect in California at the beginning of the year. There is no doubt the Hydro market has been reset going into 2019. We can't do anything about that. You probably noticed in our press release that we took a $95 million noncash impairment charge in the quarter based on Hawthorne valuation. I'll elaborate on this later but it's essentially a mass driven exercise which starts with how we performed in 2018. Obviously, we're far from our original target and it will take longer to reach the overall level of profitability we assumed when we purchased the businesses. That said, I would challenge any of you to name another company in the hydroponics space that's better positioned than Hawthorne. Yes, the market is changing faster than we and others expected but that actually works to our benefit.\nOur use of language in the past may have led to confusion on this point, so let me clear some things up. When we use the word hobbyist, we are not simply referring to people who grow cannabis for their own personal consumption. That's actually a tiny portion of the overall marketplace. Our use of the term mostly refers to small professional growers, who happen to buy their growing equipment in retail channels. Now are those small professional growers facing stiffer competition from larger growers? Yes. But it's just another kind of professional grower. What's unique about Hawthorne is that we're the only player in this space that is fully able to meet the needs of all growers. Our challenge is pretty straightforward at this point. It's all about execution. As we look into 2019 for Hawthorne, in addition to the Sunlight we expect organic sales of Hydro products to increase in the mid-single digits.\nWe expect strong gross margin improvement and overall segment profit of roughly $60 million. Before I turn things over to Randy, I want to come full circle and talk about the U.S. consumer business and our outlook for next year. You'll see that our guidance assumes sales growth of 1% to 2% in the segment. Embedded in that number is three points of pricing on a consolidated basis, which includes increases to some categories as high as 5% and others flat. We're also expecting strong results for Miracle-Gro performance organics, our new line of organic plant food and growing media products. We believe this is the first organic product line that delivers performance on par with synthetic products.\nI believe performance organics is the most important new product we've created in years and has the potential to transform the gardening industry category and bring new consumers into the space. While we have several things driving the U.S. consumer business next year, we also expect the gap between consumer POS and our selling to the retainer. Let me help you understand the offsets. First, due to the way the Roundup Agency agreement is structured, profits from that relationship will be lower next year by $20 million. This should not be a surprise to anyone. Those of you who understand the accounting for Roundup also know that the profit from that business flows through the sales line. So even if actual sales of the product are flat, the impact on the top line will be a negative $20 million.\nThat said, because of the current uncertainties about the upcoming season, we've engaged the Bayer team about this structure and we're encouraged so far by their response. We also entered the year cautiously optimistic about the potential for improvement in the mass retail channel. I recently had the benefit of a top-to-top meeting at one of our major players in this channel. We're both aligned in our commitment to drive improved performance in 2019 for the mutual benefit of both of our companies and the consumer. Does that mean we expect growth out of this channel in 2019? I hope so. At a minimum, I believe we'll find ourselves in a situation where we're working more collaboratively and finding more ways to win. So I see this is as a good sign. With all the puts and takes, we expect consumer POS growth of 3% to 5% next year on like-for-like products.\nSo the underlying health of our consumers and their support of our brands remains solid. We're done looking back on the challenges we've seen over the past year. In fact in the closing months of 2018, we've proactively dealt with pending litigation, questions about impairment and other subjective nonoperating issues that we could simply get behind us. We did this because I want our focus in 2019 to be only on one thing, looking forward. On getting our business back on track that we've been traveling and rebuilding our credibility with all of you. I believe we've taken a thoughtful and conservative approach to our guidance in 2019 and Randy can give you more insights on that shortly. But when it comes to running the business, Mike and the operating team are pushing hard.\nWe are aggressively protecting our margins in the face of higher costs. We are bringing game-changing innovation to the marketplace and we continue to refine the Hawthorne operating model and plan to take advantage of this quickly evolving new market opportunity. With all this set, it would be disingenuous for me to ignore the share price and the impact our performance that's had on shareholders this year. After all, I didn't shy away from the issue a year ago when we were trading in an all-time high. I want to remind everyone listening that my family is the largest shareholder, so I'm no happier than any of you. But I'm committed and look forward to having a more positive story to share with all of you in 2019. With that, let me turn things over to Randy.\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Jim H has already covered a lot of important ground and the results we announced today are pretty much in line with the updated guidance we provided in June. So my plan is to explain some of the nuances around our Q4 and full year results and then discuss our 2019 guidance. So let's move on. The top line results from the U.S. Consumer segment for both Q4 and the full year are consistent with our guidance. There were no material changes in the performance of the business during the quarter, so I won't dwell. Jim already dissected the Hawthorne numbers but I do want to add some color here. AeroGrow's results were slightly better than we expected. That base is not huge, so it's easy to get a big percentage gain. We're also extremely pleased with our European professional horticulture business, which is almost excessively lighting. Remember both the Gavita and Agrolux brands started in Europe and remain extremely popular growers in several key markets. These two positives helped to offset the continued softness within the U.S. hydroponics business. Jim mentioned an approximate 30% decline in the U. S. hydroponic sales on an apples-to-apples basis. This is an area where understanding the approach we took to the Sunlight transaction is helpful. You may recall we said that market disruptions after the deal could lead to about $0.10 of additional dilution. What we wanted (inaudible) publicly at that time for competitive reasons, is that we intended to end Hawthorne sales to other distributors. Those distributors were sitting on Hawthorne inventory after we stopped selling to them and they moved aggressively to sell our products to retailers. We expected that to happen and knew we would likely lose some sales in the near term as a result. As a reminder, we got to a $0.30 to $0.40 dilution in 2010 from the deal and our actual results landed in the middle of that range. We also previously outlined a $0.60 to $0.80 EPS increase for Hawthorne in 2019 and we continue to expect an increase at the lower end of this range when including interest and amortization expenses that are incremental to the company but outside segment operating income. So when you exclude all the distribution in both Q3 and Q4, you see a decline approaching 40% in Q3 and slightly more than 30% in Q4. We've also been telling investors that we expect the consumable side of Hawthorne, mostly nutrients and growing media, to see a recovery before we saw that happen with durable products.\nThat prediction has proven correct. While growing media and nutrients declined by about 15% in Q4, this was a significant improvement from what we saw in Q3. I agree with Jim's assessment. There are several encouraging signs that we're starting to see at Hawthorne. I also agree that it's too soon to declare a turnaround here. The December quarter is likely to show a decline as well.\nLet's move on to the gross margin line. This is the one area of our revised guidance where we missed. In June, we said we expected a decline in the rate for the year up to 300 basis points. As you can see, the actual decline was 360 basis points. Within the quarter, we saw a significant and unexpected margin issue develop in our Canadian professional business. This is not affiliated with Hawthorne. This issue which was largely caused by distribution challenges is now behind us, was the primary driver in missing guidance. The primary driver is in the overall decline in adjusted gross margin rate for the year, where higher overall distribution and commodity expenses, unfavorable fixed cost absorption and the acquisitions impact from Hawthorne and higher trade programs expense that was planned at the start of the year. We expect commodities and distribution to continue to be a headwind in 2019 but we believe our pricing actions will offset those challenges. I'll come back to this in a few minutes. In terms of SG&A, the 6% increase in the quarter was largely driven by the Sunlight transaction.\nOverall, SG&A was down 2% for the year despite acquisition. Going into the year, we did some restructuring, so those benefits helped. Also about $10 million of advertising expense was spent collaborating with retailers and therefore, we reclassified the trade programs, which are netted against invoice sales. In addition, annual variable compensation was about half of last year's levels but this was mostly offset by higher long-term incentive expense, primarily tied to our expected cumulative free cash flow over a multiyear period. Our 2017 and 2018 performance and our confidence about the future cause us to accrue more in the current year.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, EPS came in on the low end of the range we set when we adjusted guidance in June, primarily because of the Canadian issue I mentioned earlier. For Q4, the non-GAAP adjusted loss was $41.6 million or $0.75 per share compared with a loss of $14.9 million or $0.26 per share. On a GAAP basis, the loss was $130.6 million or $2.36 per share compared with $42.3 million or $0.72 per share. GAAP income from continuing operations for the full year was $127.6 million or $2.23 per share compared with $198.3 million or $3.29 per share. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings were $211.6 million or $3.71 per share compared with $236.9 million or $3.94 per share a year ago. The full year diluted share count was 57.1 million compared with 60.2 million, reflecting share repurchase activity of 328 million for the year.\nJim already mentioned the Hawthorne impairment of $95 million was excluded from the adjusted numbers. Also excluded was an additional charge of $20 million related to a litigation matter associated with our former wild poultry business. Remember that we also took a $65 million charge in the third quarter related to the same matter. We're in the final stages of settling that case, which is a class action lawsuit and look forward to getting it behind us. The last topic I want to reinforce is cash flow. We've said repeatedly that we consider cash flow our most important metric and I think we proved that again in 2018. Our operating cash flow came in at $343 million, not far off from what we saw last year despite the sharp decline in earnings, no doubt the benefit from lower taxes helped. But I'm particularly pleased with our working capital management especially inventory.\nDespite lower-than-expected sales in our U.S. Consumer segment, we still lowered our inventory levels in this business by $20 million. I still believe we have further room for improvement and the changes we made to our compensation programs are keeping the organization focused on this metric. We've also talked more frequently over the last year about free cash flow productivity, which we calculate by dividing free cash flow by GAAP net income. In our press release financials, we include a reconciliation of this non-GAAP disclosure item. The ratio was 134% in 2017 and 431% in 2018, which obviously requires some explanation. The 2018 ratio is impacted by certain noncash items that reduced our GAAP net income.\nIf we exclude our noncash impairment restructuring and other items and the non-cash accruals for litigation matters, the productivity number is more consistent with what we saw in 2017. Looking ahead to 2019 on an apples-to-apples comparison, the 431% in 2018 will likely fall below 100% due to the timing of expected payments for these litigation matters. However, excluding payments on the litigation matters, our goal is to have at least 100% productivity once again on operating cash flow of $290 million to $300 million and free cash flow of $220 million to $230 million.\nWith that, let's shift gears and talk about 2019 P&L guidance. On a companywide basis, we are expecting 10% to 11% sales growth with 1% to 2% from U.S. consumer, about 8 points from Sunlight and another 1 point from organic Hawthorne growth. Jim already bridged the U. S. consumer number but I want to applaud the team for staying focused on getting the price increases we needed to offset the cost pressures we're seeing.\nNo one expects relief in the freight market next year and every commodity we're purchasing is up over last year. The combination of these pressures is upwards of $30 million. Recall, that we did not take pricing in 2018. That was a decision that hurt us when commodities and distribution expense were more unfavorable than we expected. The pricing we're taking in 2019 will provide some improvement to the gross margin rate next year in the U.S. Consumer segment. However, we expect that improvement to be offset by the mix impact from Sunlight. So on a full year companywide basis, we expect the rate to be about flat.\nLet me also take a few moments to address tariffs. Our full year impact is currently estimated to less than $10 million after mitigation plans and most of this amount stems from the fourth round of tariffs that largely impact our Hawthorne segment. We are planning a small price increase on certain SKUs to offset this impact. In SG&A, there are lot of moving pieces. The eight incremental months of Sunlight, obviously, will result in higher expense and the advertising dollars that were spent in customer trade programs in 2018 will be put back in the SG&A in 2019. We're also expecting higher investments from people. Like most companies, we're starting to see wage inflation and retaining our best people in this robust economy requires us to take a look at both compensation and benefit dollars. We are also planning for higher annual bonuses in 2019 tied to expectations of much higher probability and continued strong free cash flow. When everything nets out, we see SG&A up 5% or 6% higher. I think that's actually a good place to land given the impact of acquisitions. Next year, we'll also see the full year impact of the Sunlight deal on our interest expense. Our best estimate is that interest will come in somewhere between $100 million to $110 million for the full year. Our leverage ratio at the end of fiscal 2018 was 4.2x and I would expect that ratio to only decrease slightly in 2019 before falling more dramatically in 2020 due to the back half timing of our operating cash flow and the pro forma nature of the leverage calculation, which currently already includes Hawthorne synergies.\nWe're guiding to an effective tax rate of 25% for 2019 and a share count of roughly 56.5 million shares. As we focus on leverage, it's unlikely we'll be repurchasing shares in 2019. If we do, I'd expect to have only a modest impact on next year's share count. Bringing all this to the bottom line, our adjusted EPS guidance for next year is $4.10 to $4.30 per share.\nBefore we open the call to your questions, I want to say that I'm aligned with Jim as it relates to our job for 2019. It's all about execution. I believe our guidance represents our best estimate for 2019 based on our current thinking. We are not getting really aggressive in our growth assumptions and we're realistically thinking about some of the cost pressures we expect to see over the course of next year.\nI'm also aligned with Jim H when it comes to driving value for our shareholders. I spent a lot of time sitting across the table from dozens of former and current shareholders this year. The hard questions you asked were well deserved and we've done our best to help you understand the challenges. I also spent a lot of time with prospective shareholders. I agree with most of you who see SMG as a strong long-term opportunity right now. I've been here almost 20 years. I know this company and I know this team. We have a strong core business that generates significant cash flow and Hawthorne remains an investment with great potential. And so I'm confident that as Jim said, confidence is one thing and results are another. We see results and we're committed to delivering it in 2019.\nWith that, let me turn things back to the operator to take your questions. Thanks.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll first hear from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.\nJoe Altobello -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGood morning. So first question, I want to go back to a comment you made this morning and also in the release about focused inventory -- our productivity efforts in certain key retail accounts. What does that refer to? And I guess did you guys experience any changes in shelf space in light of the other price increases you're taking next year?\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nJoe, I think your first question is related to 2018 and we did see a lot of inventory productivity focus from retailers more than we've seen in prior years. So mass channel was similar to what we saw in 2017 and we largely expected that. On the home center side, I'd say there was more focus in the fourth quarter than what we've seen the year before and that was a little bit surprising compared to what we would have expected back in June.\nBut going forward, I think that's the second part of your question. We expect to see continued focus on retailer inventories and productivity. I think they're being prudent in trying to drive the cash flows just like we are. I think they're trying to find the most productive SKUs that they can push the hardest and those are largely the brands. So I think related to our pricing 3%, I think it's a terrific outcome.\nI think it's higher than our competitor set marginally and I think it shows the strength of our brands and I think when it comes to decisions made by retailers, they may be pruning some of the less productive SKUs next year but I don't necessarily associate that with pricing. I think it's just a focus on being more productive, running the business better and that's the way I've run my business as well.\nJoe Altobello -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nIs that across the category?\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt depends on category, Joe. We've seen a tighter control on the controls business going to two brands versus three. So there have been adjustments there and closing stores, there's an effect there, Bosch(ph) is out of the picture. So there's a lot of things that are affecting inventory and so you look at that.\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nJoe, I don't think it's anything to do with pricing to be honest, no, not that I'm aware of anyway..\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd Joe, it's Randy again. When you compare at the market share, we've maintained our market share again this year. So looking ahead to next year, I think we'll see a little bit of decline in units, which we debate internally whether we'll see that or not. But I think it's a prudent way to go just because retailers I think will be focused on trying to drive inventories down and continue to drive POS up and that's a good ratio for them.\nMichael Lukemire -- President\nAnd there'll be adjustments for promotional strategies as well, so...\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nJoe, I would not make a big deal out of this. I think to some extent I don't know what's real about it or not. We know one thing that a lot of retailers over winner with quite a bit of product. That to me -- we have tried to work with retailers to focus on their gross margin return on investment and that our ability to react and distribute products allows them to reduce their inventory in the off-season. I don't sense that any of them including mass are disinclined to invest in the season when it really matters. I think actually quite the opposite. So I think I don't know what it all means. I know one thing. Everybody was really happy how this year ended given how grim it looked in mid-April and I think it probably affects their psychology when it comes inventory. But I think as Randy said, it's not a bad thing. And if I were them, it's an easy way to improve your game, right. It's just saying selling a bunch of stuff for seven months a year and then selling sort of squat except sort of indoor but sitting on a bunch of inventory for five months is just kind of a problem. And the fact that they're focusing on it and making sure that the off-season there, that actually works to our benefit because I don't think anybody can respond like we can.\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nWe've had a lot of really productive conversation with our retailers over the last few weeks and I think there's a lot of energy and excitement about next year and maybe internally, we're feeling really good. We just had our annual sales conference just a few weeks ago and I'd say the team is ready to go and get after in 2019.\nMichael Lukemire -- President\nI'm more optimistic though I'm not allowed to share that.\nJoe Altobello -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nSo the U.S. Consumer sales, just help me with the math there? Sales up 1% to 2%. Pricing gets you 3%. The Roundup agreement is a negative 1%. So we're talking about volumes being kind of flat to down 1% next year with the pricing elasticity and with the potential inventory reduction that we tell effectively.\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nI'd say that it captures well. I'd also say that related to elasticity, our products are purchased frequently that consumers don't really have price point in their minds. So we haven't seen tremendous elasticity over time other than the year if you go back almost 10 years ago, when we took a 30% price increase on lawn fertilizers, there was a lot of elasticity at that point. But year-to-year, when we're talking about mid-single digit price increases, we're not really concerned about elasticity coming out of that.\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nI'd put it sort of the opposite, Joe. We're more concerned about our gross margin line eroding than we are about sort of what I would say is a very -- totally grew as Randy said is that on sort of once or twice per year, purchased products when you're dealing with 3% in this environment where freight alone -- I think we looked at and said freight is up 20% in two years with us. And basically our raws are up.\nWe got these taxes from bringing -- substituting from Asia. I just think it's one of those things where that was more important to us I think than this sort of minor fear. And I think people who aren't taking pricing right now, they are just eroding their the P&L and I don't see them benefiting from it and I see the strength that we have by maintaining the sort of quality of our earnings as actually being more important.\nJoe Altobello -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nOkay. Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nAnd next we move to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.\nWilliam Chappell -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning. Just I'm trying to make it more simple on the earnings guidance for next year. You did $3.70 in EPS. You're saying $0.60 to $0.80 from Hawthorne synergies, so in the low end of that $0.60, so that gets me to $4.30. I think I'm doing my math right. So does that just imply the core business is a negative 10 to get to the midpoint or negative 20 to the low point?\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, that's the math though. I'd say $0.60 is our estimate now for Hawthorne for next year rather than 60 days, so let's call it 60 and with the Roundup commission moving backwards, even with 3% pricing we have more commodity headwinds, distribution. We don't expect that to be turned around anytime soon. We talked earlier last couple of calls about labor inflation that we're seeing. That's to end up more in the gross margin rate and less in SG&A than what we would have modeled to go back six months ago. But when you factor in all those headwinds and net that against pricing, your math is right.\nWilliam Chappell -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nI've think you've said that you didn't price for variable comp going into next year but you believe you can earn that. I mean does that -- do you whereby have in the core business as negative, you can still learn a variable comp?\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nAt this point, if we would hit the midpoint of our range we actually would be paying below target next year, Bill. So yes, it will be higher year-over-year but it won't be back to target levels and we expect to try to beat that number but I think where we're at right now in early November, I think very appropriate guidance to provide.\nWilliam Chappell -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nAnd then in early -- and I understand that. I understand we're a few months away. In the comment on the Hydro basis, as we're looking -- I understand you're thinking the December quarter will still be down. Are you seeing it flip as we move into November where it's actually growing on a monthly basis?\nJim King -- Head of Investor Relations\nFor the first time, we're introducing --. No, no, I'm actually not going to answer it. I'm going to give it to Chris Hagedorn to answer it.\nChris Hagedorn --\nHey, guys, so it's Chris. Sorry my voice is a little scratchy, I've got a cold. So the short answer is yes, we're stating to see some positive, really encouraging results as we move into November and it's particularly when you look at the business by particular categories. We're seeing some bounce back in the U.S. kind of Hydro market which is still largely a retail market for us. As Jim made the point earlier about sort of hobbyist, the retail market is still serving kind of what I would call smaller scale professional kind of commercial growers. But the bounce back that we're seeing it's encouraging not only right now for this quarter but certainly for the long-term outlook for me is we're seeing really strong results as Jim mentioned in our European and Russian (inaudible) business continues to over perform. Those guys are the most professional growers in the world. I mean, they're Dutch and Russian indoor growers have been doing this for hundreds of years. The other thing that makes me feel pretty confident about this is the results we're seeing up in Canada. As Jim mentioned, we're putting an increased focus on our sales up there on a relationship with a larger scale LP, so this is oftentimes big publicly traded guys like Canopy or Aurora, very large professional companies. The progress that we've made with an increased focus up there, establishing top-to-top relationships as well as dealing with the guys that are actually growing these plants, we're seeing really encouraging results. We've over delivered there sort of early results yet for this fiscal year, obviously. But again the numbers that are rolling in are better than we expected and that makes me pretty confident for the future here in the U. S. as well. As we look at Canada largely as kind of a proxy for what America would be whenever we see larger scale legalization. And last night was a good night for us in terms of legalization. I feel pretty confident that we can win in that and that structure because we are winning in that environment right now in Canada.\nWilliam Chappell -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. And I guess last just a follow-up on that. Is California stable as a market? Or is it still year-over-year decline?\nChris Hagedorn --\nCalifornia is beginning to stabilize. Our outlook for this year is positive for California but it's not particularly explosive. I mean, we're looking at -- can I share what we're looking at? Yes, we're looking at 2% year-over-year growth for California. So again, conservative, but I think we'll see that business start to stabilize and hopefully slowly bounce back. But the real growth that we're looking at this business is Canada and then other parts of the U.S. that really haven't seen the growth that California had already seen leading into this year, so places like the Northeast.\nWilliam Chappell -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks so much.\nOperator\nAnd next we'll move on to Chris Carey with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nChris Carey -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGood morning. So just following up on that line of questioning actually, you mentioned you're serving the retail -- or, excuse me, at the retail hydroponic distribution channels. Those are in the mid- to large-scale grower or excuse me, small to mid-scale grower. So how is that you serve the largest scale grower? Because you are still precluded from dealing directly with that consumer, are you not? And then do you not have that same constraint in Canada since early legal?\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo Chris, let me start with Canada. We don't have that same kind of constraints because of federal legalization in Canada, so much easier to do business there and we're making our progress there over the last few months particularly. When it comes to U.S. yes, we had to be extremely careful due to legal issues, due to banking concerns and how we go to business. So while we can talk to certain growers, we can't sell to them directly and we have to bill through third parties or through our existing retailers. So that's how we're going to business, so we can still develop relationships. What we can't do is sell or ship to them directly. But we're seeing a lot of progress like Chris pointed out and I think we're starting to turn probably not this quarter but looking out over the balance of 2019, we do think things are going to start getting better.\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nLook, I would say that from -- we have been really careful with sort of making sure the lawyers, both our external and internal plus our treasury group and finance in general are involved in our sort of go-to-market strategies for the U.S. They presented a plan to me that I saw this week that puts together a group of sort of third party resellers that is sort of our way to sort to provide insulation to that. And I know Randy is going to be talking to our banks and taking them through that plan as well. But I put it up as sort of required but I put it in the frictional loss category of why the rules in this country need to be fixed, then start with Congress. And I don't expect our banks to lead into this. I do expect the Congress to lead into this and I think the results last night were really important for that.\nAnd while I'm not a big supporter of the Democratic Party in general, I think when it comes to our issues in the House -- you've already seen with Cory Gardner, Senator from Colorado, what he calls the States Act, which I think is fairly well supported within the Senate. It just didn't get a lot of traction on the House side to push it forward. I think that's over. And I think within that, you'll probably see a move to include reform on the banking side or selling in states where it's legal and so I'm very confident of that. In the interim, we will develop insulation that satisfies the lawyers and the bankers. But hopefully, we can move through that like Canada where it's a much more direct relationship in time.\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd the other thing, Chris, I'd point out is the great, great majority of our sales still go to retailer. And our retail partners have been terrific. It's been challenging time for us but challenging time for retail as well. Retailers are sticking with us. The legacy businesses that we purchased going back three-plus years ago, the relationships we have are strong and then the business that we acquired with Sunlight Supply, strong retailer relationship as well. So that's really where we should do today. And I think we need to say thanks to all the people who have stuck up with us.\nChris Hagedorn --\nYes. So I totally agree with what Jim and Randy said. This is Chris. So just to reiterate that last point that Randy made. Look the reality is the marketplace is evolving in the way that these larger-scale more professional growers are going to get their products, it's going to continue to evolve as well. But my hope and our hope here when we're working hard with our retail partners is to help the retail evolve along with us and the grower. In the future, I think there's definitely a place for retail but just like the rest of us, retail is going to have to evolve along with the rest of the marketplace. So we are trying to help and encourage our retailers to do that. We've seen a lot of them really happily kind of join us in that journey. So I hope that continues but it's good so far.\nChris Carey -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOkay, got it. Thanks. So California plus 2. Obviously, that would imply other markets growing faster. It strikes me that Canada still has a ton of production capacity that they are building out. You have the Canadian LPs also looking at Europe. So I guess I'm trying to reconcile that with the confidence on Hawthorne turning positive in the back half of the year, next year, or the fiscal year anyways. I mean, are there specific opportunities or projects that you have in mind? Or is this more about kind of stabilization efforts, do you have contracts with growers that are building out and Canada for example? And anything like that that you can provide a little bit of incremental color on this turn that you expect?\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure, Chris. So, like you point out, there's still a lot of opportunity in Canada, we're getting after that much more, we've actually co-oped(ph) some of our existing salespeople in our Canadian business to start becoming salespeople for Hawthorne. So we're seeing success from that right now. We're not expecting tremendous rebound right now in California or the West Coast. We think a lot of the growth will come out of Florida, East Coast and some of these new states. And again, we're trying to be conservative on California seeing plus 2. I think inevitably, the entire market should come back to levels that we saw 18 months ago but we're not planning for that for next year until we start seeing positive quarters. I think once we start seeing positive quarters and get the momentum back, the margins will improve. Valuation will improve and everything will work out fine.\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, just to add to that. A little bit more detail on what Randy was saying. So some of the states that we're looking at, we expect to see some pretty positive results for this year, are more -- what I would consider more unexpected state. Everyone know Michigan, we had a really good result there in the vote last night. So Michigan should be big for us, we're counting on that. Oklahoma is a pretty explosive growth state for us at this point. A lot of new retails opening up. So a lot of volumes move through that state. Florida as well. So I think we are seeing a lot of activity in newer states that are coming online with the expectations again that the Northeast will explode starting with -- everyone expects New Jersey will kind of lead the charge on that.\nChris Carey -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks so much. And then just one kind of final, I guess, modeling question in a way. Did I hear that US(ph) ex-POS of 3 to 5 in U.S. consumer nest year. And if so, it feels like that's maybe a bit ahead of where you had been talking in that business in the 2 to 4? So if you could talk to why you have like incrementally positive expectations there? Thank you.\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So Chris, with 3% pricing in a way have that baked in that 3% to 5% number, so same units going out the doors with 3% pricing plus units. We do think though on a shipments basis, units would be back a little bit just because of the retailer productivity conversation we had previously. So that will put a little drag on shipments. But POS, you saw the retailers measure the business and we think that's going to be really positive next year.\nMichael Lukemire -- President\nAnd innovation, I'd add innovation to it, so with the performance organics second year, Thick'R and Turf Builder.\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd we have ground clear line\nChris Hagedorn --\nSo we have lots of opportunity.\nOperator\nAnd next we'll move to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard -- Cleveland Research and Company -- Analyst\nA couple things. First of all, curious if you could -- I guess, Chris, perhaps you're the right guy to answer the question, the customer mix of Hawthorne today, I understand it's been helpful how you characterize what the market looks like and what hobbyist looks like? But what did your customer mix look like today within the business?\nChris Hagedorn --\nCustomer mix between large-scale retail -- excuse me, large scale, commercial retail was small scale, can you be a little bit more specific with the question?\nEric Bosshard -- Cleveland Research and Company -- Analyst\nYes. I don't know enough to characterize between the obvious in retail and direct to the Pro. You probably know the segments better than me, so how you think about your customer mix?\nChris Hagedorn --\nYes. So look the vast majority of our business, as we said, in some of the previous questions still goes to retail. It's a difficult question to really put up to find a point on as the grower base continues to evolve. I would say from -- if you look at these growers professional versus hobbyist, what I would consider hobbyist, which is people growing for their own consumption. It's probably 95% plus professional growers. Up in Canada, obviously, those are extremely large-scale, large staffs of people, hundreds of thousand of square feet growing space, he in the U.S. it really varies state-by-state. How much of that helps answer your question at all?\nEric Bosshard -- Cleveland Research and Company -- Analyst\nAnd your mix, is that the market you just spoke to is that your Hawthorne mix?\nChris Hagedorn --\nIt's really both. I think our customer mix is pretty indicative of the grower base overall.\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nJust getting to Eric's question. A shift toward larger growers sort of coming out of sort of more investment for kind of professional investments for safety you see that shipment.\nChris Hagedorn --\nAbsolutely, yes. It's definitely a shift from, look I would say we've been selling to professional growers this entire time. The businesses that we've acquired, we're selling professional growers long before we own them. But those smaller scale growers and we've -- I think we've kind of hid from the word black market for a long time but really these were smaller scale professional black-market growers growing at the smear(ph) garage. A lot of those guys are graduating out to becoming what I would call larger scale sort of more mature professional growers, who were growing in greenhouses or larger indoor setups. So that evolution has taken place and that's the one that I think has happened a little bit more quickly than we or anyone else frankly in the U.S. anticipated. What gives me confidence is, we have grown up at ScottsMiracle-Gro with a professional business serving a professional customer.\nIt's something we understand pretty well. We still have a lot of people on our staff, folks we brought back into Hawthorne who were with Scotts Professional Business prior. So it's been a transition that's taken place a little bit more rapidly than we anticipated but I still am certain that we are at the best position to take advantage of them.\nEric Bosshard -- Cleveland Research and Company -- Analyst\nWithin that I guess just a follow up that, your market share with professionals in your core business is lower than with DIY customers in the traditional lawn and garden business. Within the cannabis business, within the Hydro business, do you have a competitive advantage or disadvantage to have more success with a pro customer. Again I know it's an evolving market but do you compare/contrast is the question?\nChris Hagedorn --\nYes I'm glad you asked. Because the answer absolutely is we absolutely have the (inaudible) share, the way to look at this and say look, there is no one in our space who has the breadth of whether it's product offering knowledge, service sort of operational maturity that we have. There are folks that are entering -- I've heard people speculating saying, do the large scale growers care about brands? The answer is yes.\nThey are growing a very valuable crop. What they care about is their ability to remain profitable and operate efficiently. And the products that we sell and the brands that we sell are built upon that reliability and that consistency. Outside of that, there are horticulture and agriculture distributors who I'm sure are and will continue to make pushes into the space. What they don't have that we do is a knowledge of this particular plan. It's not hard to grow a cannabis plant. It's really hard to grow a good cannabis plant. And it's especially hard to grow a good cannabis plant consistently harvest after harvest year in, year out.\nThat's what we can bring people. And it's the ability to look at not just a nutrient or a light or a growing media product but look at all of those products sort of in an ecosystem and understand how they affect each other. From an innovation perspective, a product development perspective, no one has that perspective that we do. So that I think is a pretty significant competitive advantage for us.\nEric Bosshard -- Cleveland Research and Company -- Analyst\nAnd then two other shorter questions. The organic growth assumption for Hawthorne, it sounds like you're talking about 5% in 2019. What should we think about normalized growth? Obviously, 2019 is a transition year. What normalized organic growth should this portfolio be able to generate from a medium-term perspective?\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, so when we look beyond 2019, we look more at in consumer demand and what that model would look like over time. So we know penetration or per capita usage is increasing 5%, 6%, 7% annually. On top of that, the shift from outdoor growing somewhat to it's going to be almost exclusively indoor unless you're talking about the West Coast is a tailwind for us. We know that the mix of products and concentrated products or edibles require more product as well. So I think all those tailwinds should get us in the long run, midterm long run, back into a number that we could easily tuck ourselves into double digits again. Just for 2019 until we start seeing positive quarters, we're not going to lead you down that road but our long-term thinking is that's exactly where it is.\nEric Bosshard -- Cleveland Research and Company -- Analyst\nAnd then lastly I was a bit confused. You talked about -- it sounded like you said an upside longer-term variable comp payout and I'm interested in how you contrast that with the write off within Hawthorne, those two seem to be an opposition.\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nThere is really no relation one to the other. So we established a five-year long-term incentive plan a couple of years ago. It's two-thirds based on cummulative free cash flow over a five-year period and one-third based on total shareholder return proxy more or less, through two years we're doing well on free cash flow; we're not doing very well on the PSR proxy. But as we look out for the next three years and determine what we should accrue, we've had a positive first couple years on cash flow even though this year was a challenge on earnings. And given our focus and our plans, we expect that cash flow focus to continue and we're excited about the future when we think our P&L will rebound again and 2019 will be a down payment on that. That's the way the plan is constructed.\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt does sort of get caught in the cry(ph). I sort of understand that but what I try to do is view this as a positive as opposed to negative because if we don't turn the stuff around, you need to payout for squat. Okay? But it's when you're actually putting money into it and from that accounting point of view, it is based on our basically projections of free cash flow and driving value back into the business. So what it says is that our forward view is consistent with a above average payout in that plan in spite of the fact if you look at today and say dude really? And I get that. But it is based on -- our pretty seriously on our cash flow forecast going forward. And I've said many times on these calls that I think that the ultimate driver of the value for business is sort of access to free cash. It is something that we have done OK on and maybe better tan OK.\nBut I think we've got to do a lot better and that's one of the reasons we did Hawthorne was to do that. So I think the accounting exercise are sort of charging the account call it for our future thing it's just the math that the finance group is doing and saying if you think this is true there's going to be above target payout and we've got a charge for that. So that's what it means. So instead of looking at this and saying, what the heck? I think -- notice that I didn't use a bad word there, what the heck? It really says something about our view of the future, which is positive.\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd our cash flow is very much driven by our U.S. consumer core business with EBITDA of $500 million or so. Right now, Hawthorne is 10% or so of that. So that's what's driving our productivity on the long-term plan. Again, our PSR return this year is suffering because of Hawthorne and back to your question about impairment but that's the way the plan is constructed. I think we're running our core well and we expect Hawthorne to turn around as well.\nOperator\nAnd our final question today will come from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review.\nDavid Stratton -- Great Lakes Review -- Analyst\nHi, thanks for taking the question. Really quick back to the core business, you talked about your private label being your primary competitor? And is there any opportunity or do you already have some of your products as private labels? Or we should be able to move into private labels as an offering?\nThomas Randal Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure, David. So right now, we do probably two-thirds or maybe 75% of the total category of private label if you look across the landscape, the lawn and garden. Then there is probably an opportunity to do more going forward. Every retailer has its own way of going about private label. Now they choose who they select as a vendor and how they merchandise their products and that may evolve a lot in the short run and within mass the last couple of years. Again if you look at the last 10 years or five years or three years, we've maintained share, actually grown share versus private label. And the only place that we've lost has just been the last two years with one particular retailer. We don't think that's a consumer-driven situation at all. It's simply a merchandising decision and we haven't seen that trip over in any other customers at this point.\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nBut we're happy to make private label for people and we are doing that.\nMichael Lukemire -- President\nWe know private label is an important part of sort of the profit stream of and if you look at overtime at least in lawn and garden, where we participate, it's probably 60% of the dollars are on the branded side and about probably 50% of the units are private label and that's been pretty consistent over the years if you look at it. I know there are some retailers who think Scotts is already sort of big enough, why should we put more? And I'll tell you why if a retailer is listening right now. Nobody has got the footprint we have to private label. And I don't think there's anybody who can beat our price, who's a legitimate player. And so I challenge any retailer to talk to us about using our footprint, our manufacturing and supply chain footprint for their benefit and deliver everything together on one truckload and no one else can do that. And so I make that offer and challenge to all retailers who we aren't already doing business with and say I can help you make more money.\nDavid Stratton -- Great Lakes Review -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks. And then I guess to kind of segue that same question over to the Hawthorne business. I think, Chris, you mentioned that cannabis is certainly easy to grow but difficult to grow well, which is a competitive advantage against other more important cultural businesses. But I think that horticultural people would say that's true for all plants. A lot plants are easy to grow but difficult to grow well. And is there a potential there to get your products into the more horticulturally based businesses as a private label to expand your market?\nChris Hagedorn --\nAbsolutely. We've been looking at cannabis. It's a huge opportunity and one that we are focused on pretty singularly at the moment. But our long-term plan here is, look we want to take in as much advantage of this past year notwithstanding the explosive growth that we've seen. But long term, this business got a lot of technology, allow us to enter sort of the food supplier side of things on what I would like to see on a global scale. So the answer is yes.\nI think we're learning how to grow plants in a really high-performance method here that not a lot of other people had the margin the sort of allow them luxury of. The hope is long-term we can bring cost out of our products. We can apply those techniques and products to the broader food market on a global scale. So the answer is yes.\nJames Hagedorn -- Chief Executive Officer\nBut I'd also hoped -- sort of talking strategy out loud here that Hawthorne will be open to all retailer brands participating in the private label as well and offering your sort of manufacturing footprint to the benefit of other resellers.\nOperator\nAnd that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim King for any additional or closing remarks.\nJim King -- Head of Investor Relations\nAll right. Thank you, Rochelle.
