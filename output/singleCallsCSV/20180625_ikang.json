I will begin the call today with a few opening remarks regarding our results, followed by highlights of a key business and a corporate development. And after that, Luke will provide details on the financial side before opening the floor to questions.\niKang closed its fiscal year 2017 well-positioned for strong and sustained growth in the years ahead. We have exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance, with RMB 3.74 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. There are few key takeaways from our fourth-quarter and our full fiscal-year results that speak to the work we have been doing to position our business for the future. Some relate to the anticipating and accommodating the underlying trends in our industry and some relate to our focus on strong execution.\nThe first important fact to note is the continuous enhancement in our gross profit and our growth [ph] margin from a strong traction of revenue growth. Please go straight to Slide 4 for the highlights of the fiscal first quarter and the full fiscal year ended at March 31, 2018. Net revenue up 48.8% for the quarter and 29.4% for the full year with robust performance across all our business segments, as well as promising trends for our value-added services. Gross profit of 803.7%, with gross margin at 15% of fourth quarter, as compared to 2.6% in fiscal fourth quarter 2016.\nFor fiscal year 2017, gross profit is up by 37.3%, with growth margin further enhanced to 42.3%. This growth demonstrates the benefit our investment in delivering high-value-added services and deriving solution for [Inaudible] expanding customer base. Next, is the growth in our core and new businesses. We have our gross [ph] revenue base and a broadening of all service offerings continues to drive our growth significantly.\nOver the last several years, we have built up our capacities in value-added services leveraging on our expanding network of medical centers through self-construction and acquisition. We continue to invest in service offerings and a solution in those areas in which there is a significant customer demand such as [Indiscernible], dental services, and other services including in vitro diagnosis and genetic testing. Third, our nationwide networks creates a strong platform for our business growth slower -- come to relation in Tier 1 cities and the penetration into low-tier cities. On Slide 5 with a total of 112 operating medical centers, our network of 33 of China's most affluent cities as of March 31, 2018.\nOur expansion into the fast-growing Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities is particularly exciting, as shown on Slide 6, with the averaging -- with coverage accounting for 55% of our network and contributing 36% of the total revenue for fiscal year 2017, as compared to 51% of our network and contributing 30.3% of the total revenue in fiscal year 2016. Fourth, the significant increase in quality corporate and the increased customer base reflecting only in customers visits but also in ASP. On Slide 7, for fiscal year 2017 the individual customers have shown a solid growth of 34.9% in visit with corporate customers maintaining a steady growth of 15.4%. The ASP growth hasn't been strong with a plenty of ASPs for individual customers at 2.2% and corporate at 6.3% in terms of year-over-year growth.\nOn a full-year basis, customer visits have increased by close to 17.9% to 6.59 million. The underlying fact driving this growth has been the increasing awareness and a demand not only for preventive healthcare but also value-added services. As many of you know, iKang has made substantial investments in broadening our value-added services offering of the past several years in anticipation of changing trends in both customer demand and the way business is transacted in our industry. Working the benefit of this investment with increasing revenue contribution and its positive impact on growth profit and the growth margin.\nAn example of this is on Slide 8, which has demonstrated the increasing demand for our premium service and our high-end customers after which the revenue from our three MRI centers has doubled over fiscal year 2017. This differentiated our brand strategy, looked extremely well and the right amount resonates with the change in needs of different customer segments. Last, but not least; on Slide 9, the launch of iKangCare+ and iKangPartners+ plans has been a game changer for us and has backed us to create a potentially powerful ecosystem with the preventive healthcare service in China and well-positioned as a leading service provider to capitalize on opportunity from changes that have taken place in our industry. What is notable about this is that we are now able to leverage the expertise and offerings from growing the partnerships and integration across our broadest customer base.\nThe marked opportunities we see are enormous. To this end, we have further expanded the ecosystem by advancing initiatives to continue the enhanced customer's engagement and a service delivery. The progress so far has to be encouraging as shown in Slide 10. Dental services have expanded their coverage covering 24 cities with 50 clinics and over 300 chair.\nSince its launch in 2015, Doctor Referral Apps services have significantly increased in its coverage with 842 hospitals in 105 cities and over 108,000 doctors representing a year-over-year increase of a 40 -- 417%, 119% and 2,085% respectively. iKang App recorded over 3.3 million registered users and over 4.3 million retrieved reports. The outpatient service has increased better serving over 60,000 customers in full fiscal year 2017. For the fiscal year, we are pleased with our results and the progress in excluding our long-term growth strategies.\nThe continued expansion of customer base nationwide network value-added service offerings and the partnership have given us additional operates and that as a week in Tier 2 scaled our business. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Luke Chen, for the financial review.\nYang \"Luke\" Chen -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Lee.

[Operator instructions] First question comes from the line of Peter Halesworth of Heng Ren. Please ask your question.\nPeter Halesworth -- Heng Ren Partners -- Portfolio Manager\nYes. I have two questions. First is, when will the go-private plan be officially announced? And you previously stated third quarter, that's in a few weeks, so I'd like to know more specifics on that. And the second question is, which investors would be getting carried through or rolled over? How does an investor apply for this privilege? Is the privilege only available for an exclusive club, and why aren't all significant investors being invited to roll over? If it's not available to all significant investors is this discriminatory, or possibly illegal by not disclosing the roll-over terms and how this privilege is provided? We're a significant shareholder, and -- as are others -- who've not yet been approached.\nSome clarity and disclosure on this would be appreciated. Thank you.\nLigang Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThis earning call is [Inaudible] for the very purpose of updating [Inaudible] -- update the financial results, and also opportunity to update investors on performance and progress.
