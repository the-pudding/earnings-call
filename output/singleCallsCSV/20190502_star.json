Dan?\nDaniel P. Donovan -- Interim Chief Executive Officer and President\nYes. Thanks Chris. I just wanted to make a -- take a brief moment to introduce our new President and CEO, Jeff Woosnam. He and his team have been in place since mid-March, but in reality they've been a part of the company for decades. The Board has complete confidence in Jeff and the other executives at Star Group, they are extremely qualified and uniquely qualified to take Star to the next level as a leading organization dedicated to serving the home energy industry. They know the company, they know the markets better than anyone else, and they have transitioned very smoothly into their new roles. The Board looks forward to seeing positive results from management's focus on the fundamentals and the execution of Star's core strategic objectives.\nWith that I'll turn it over to Jeff.\nJeffrey M. Woosnam -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Dan and good morning everyone. I'm excited and honored to be appointed to my role as President and CEO at Star Group. And with a new management team now in position, I am pleased to reaffirm our commitment to being the most reputable company in the home energy space. Rich Ambury, Jeff Hammond, Joe McDonald and I along with what I consider to be the strongest group of employees in our industry are ready to take the company with new heights of accomplishment, in terms of growth, market presence and providing long term returns to our investors. We will accomplish this by being laser focused on clearly distinguishing Star from our competitors, I provided the absolute best customer experience and service available within our industry.\nWhile we've achieved a great deal over the years, we believe there's still tremendous opportunity for us to continue to refine and execute the fundamentals of our core business. Our team has already begun working to evaluate all of our operations, support departments and systems to determine the best path forward and to align the entire organization with the following strategic objectives. One, we want to be universally recognized as the premier service provider in the home energy industry, across all of our many brands and throughout our entire footprint by our customers, employees and the communities we serve.\nTwo, we will strive to grow our business both organically and through acquisitions. Three, we will seek to achieve solid financial returns, so that we remain a fiscally healthy and stable company for our employees, as well as continue to be an attractive and lucrative investment for our unit holders.\nAnd four, we'll be the clear employer of choice by being an industry and an organization that is invested in its people, appreciates their efforts and rewards high levels of performance. All future decisions and actions will be made with these four objectives in mind. To that end we will continue to strengthen our service platform, focus on reducing customer attrition, streamline operations where appropriate and utilize technology to effectively compete.\nI will add that I've been with Star for 24 years and have never been more optimistic about our future, because I know first-hand that our team is poised and ready to take the next step forward together to reach our full potential as a business.\nWith that I'll turn the call over to Rich Ambury to provide some comments on the quarter's results. Rich?\nRichard F. Ambury -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary\nThanks, Jeff. And good morning everyone. For the quarter our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 7 million gallons or about 4% to 173 million gallons as colder temperatures and acquisitions were more than offset by the impact of net customer attrition and other factors including the delivery scheduling variance.\nAs you might recall the extremely cold temperatures experienced during the last week of December 2017 favorably impacted volumes sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by an estimated 5 million gallons to 6 million gallons. Temperatures for the fiscal 2019 second quarter were 3% colder than last year, but still 2.6% warmer than normal. Volume of our other petroleum products sold increased by 9 million gallons or 30% to 39 million gallons largely due to acquisitions.\nOur product gross profit increased by $2 million or 1% to $222 million as an increase in home heating oil and propane margins was almost totally offset by the decline in home heating oil and propane volumes sold, again driven largely by the delivery scheduling variance. Gross profit generated from other petroleum products decreased by $2 million large -- increased by $2 million, I'm sorry, by $2 million largely due to acquisitions.\nDelivery and branch expenses increased by $4 million or 4% to $111 million during the quarter, again largely due to acquisitions, which accounted for $5 million of the increase.\nIn the base business, insurance expense was lower by $2 million and the quarter-to-quarter comparison was adversely impacted by $1 million credit recorded under our weather hedge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nWe posted net income of $72 million or $18 million higher than the prior year, as a non-cash favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $25 million was offset by a decline in adjusted EBITDA of $5 million. The company also benefited from a decline in the effective tax rate to 29% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 from 34% during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $5.3 million or about 5% to $99.5 million as the additional adjusted EBITDA provided by acquisitions of $3.4 million was more than offset by an $8.7 million decline in adjusted EBITDA in the base business. And looking at the base business adjusted EBITDA did rise by about $0.75 as the impact of colder temperatures and higher home heating oil and propane margins more than offset some higher operating expenses and the impact of the previously mentioned delivery scheduling volume variance.\nHowever, adjusted EBITDA and the base business was reduced by several factors; $3.8 million due to the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard of which the majority is expected to be reversed by the end of fiscal 2019; $2.2 million of higher legal and professional expenses; a charge of $1.5 million related to the discontinued use of our tank monitoring system; and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $600,000 associated with the company's concierge program was greatly reduced this past January; and lastly $1.3 million of expense tied to an unfavorable change in Star's whether hedge.\nFor the first half of fiscal 2019, our home heating oil and propane volume increased by 3 million gallons or 1% to 287 million gallons, as colder temperatures and acquisitions more than offset the impact of net customer attrition and other factors. Temperatures for the first half of fiscal 2018, were 4% colder than last year, but still about 2% warmer than normal. Volume of other petroleum products sold increased by 20 million gallons or 33% to 81 million gallons largely due to acquisitions.\nOur product gross profit increased by $31 million or 9% to $374 million, due to higher home heating oil and propane volumes sold at higher margins and an acquisition-driven increase in gross profit from other petroleum products.\nDelivery and branch expenses increased $16 million or 8% to $213 million partly due to acquisitions, which accounted for $9 million of the increase and $7 million increase in the base business, due to higher bad debt expense, credit card processing fees, the concierge program, additional vehicle operating expenses and inflationary pressures.\nWe posted net income for the six months of fiscal 2019 of $75 million or about $10 million lower than the prior year period, as a non-cash unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $17 million and a higher effective effect -- from a higher effective income tax rate was partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA of $12 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $12 million or 9% to $144 million. Acquisitions provided $5.1 million of the increase and in the base business adjusted EBITDA rose by $7 million.\nThe impact of colder temperatures and higher home heating oil and propane margins in the base business more than offset greater total operating expenses, improving the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA by $17.5 million. However, adjusted EBITDA and the base business was reduced by several factors; $3.2 million due to the implementation of the revenue recognition standard; $2.6 million of higher legal and professional expenses; a charge of $1.5 million related to the abandonment of our tank monitoring program; and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3 million associated with the Company's concierge program, which I have mentioned that we've pretty much curtailed this past January.\nAnd with that I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeffrey M. Woosnam -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Rich. At this time, we will please to answer any questions you may have. Alyssa could you please open the phone lines for questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nJeffrey M. Woosnam -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Andrew Gadlin with Odeon Capital. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Gadlin -- Odeon Capital Group -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. I was wondering, if you could talk first about how April has developed given that it seemed to be a pretty cold month here in the Northeast relative to normal experienced weather that could be material. And then secondly, if you could talk about some of the technology innovations that you're considering?\nJeffrey M. Woosnam -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, with regard to April, it was actually a bit warmer than what we -- I'm sorry, yes, bit warmer than what we had hoped for. And when you compare it to last April in the New York metropolitan area there was about 466 degree days. And then this April 2019 these numbers aren't final, there was 289 degree days, so that's a change April-over-April actually going the wrong way, if you will of about 177 degree days.\nDaniel P. Donovan -- Interim Chief Executive Officer and President\nAnd in terms of new technology innovations, you know, we had invested in a number of new technology platforms over the last two to three years, some of them have, I think worked out extremely well and we've received benefit from them, we're evaluating the investments that we've made and really just trying to get the expected ROI from some of the things that we've invested in, and things like mobile technologies that -- in the field for our service technicians, a new phone system that we're looking at holistically for the entire company and salesforce which is a CRM that we've invested in that we continue to try to, you know, just maximize the benefit from those systems.\nAndrew Gadlin -- Odeon Capital Group -- Analyst\nAlright. Thank you very much again.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) As there are no further questions in the queue. This concludes the question-and-answer session.
