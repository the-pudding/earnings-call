[Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Yukio Morikubo, general counsel.Â Please go ahead.\nYukio Morikubo -- General Counsel\nThank you, operator. Thank you all for joining us to discuss Impinj's second-quarter 2018 results. On today's call, Chris Diorio, Impinj's co-founder and CEO, will review our market opportunity and performance. Eric Brodersen, Impinj's president, COO, and principal financial officer, will follow with a detailed review of our second-quarter 2018 financial results and third-quarter 2018 outlook.\nWe will then open the call for questions about our second-quarter 2018 results. Chris and Eric are calling in from abroad, so Impinj's CFO consultant, Linda Breard; Impinj's executive vice president of sales and marketing, Jeff Dossett; Impinj's senior director of strategic planning, Andy Cobb; and I will assist with the Q&A session. Management's prepared remarks, along with quarterly financial data for the last eight quarters, are available on the company's website. On today's call, we will make certain statements that are not historical -- historical facts, including those regarding our plans, objectives and expected performance.\n\nTo the extent we make such statement, they are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any such forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, our actual results could differ materially because any statements based on current expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please see the risk-factors sections in our annual and quarterly reports we filed with the SEC for additional information about these risks.\nWe do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Also, during today's call, all statement-of-operations results, except for revenue or where we explicitly state otherwise, are non-GAAP financial measures. Balance sheet metrics and cash flow metrics are on a GAAP basis. Today's call to discuss our second-quarter results was delayed due to an audit committee investigation that we previously disclosed was under way related to a complaint filed by a former employee.\nThe audit committee retained independent counsel to oversee a thorough and careful investigation of the former employee's complaint and has completed its independent investigation. The audit committee concluded there was no credible evidence supporting the former employee's claims. Accordingly, the audit committee determined that no additional actions were necessary or warranted with respect to the claims or the investigation, including that no adjustments to past financial statements were appropriate or required and that at this time no further investigatory steps need to be taken. Based on the unusual timing of the call, and specifically how late we are in the third quarter, we will limit our responses in today's Q&A to questions regarding our second-quarter results.\nWe have provided third-quarter guidance in our press release and will repeat that guidance later in this call. However, we will not comment further on the current quarter and ask that you limit your questions accordingly. We look forward to speaking with you about our results for the current quarter in our regular third-quarter earnings call. I will now turn the call to Chris Diorio, Impinj's co-founder and chief executive officer.\nChris?\nChris Diorio -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Yukio. Thank you all for joining the call. Second-quarter revenue was $28.5 million, above the high end of our guidance. Endpoint IC sales exceeded expectations even as our inlay partners further reduced their inventory levels.\nBased on that reduction and our bookings trends, we anticipate third-quarter endpoint IC sales will build on the second quarter's momentum. Our systems business rebounded from first quarter 2018, as reader IC supply improved and project-based deal timing turned more favorable. We saw continued strong reader IC demand in the second quarter, and have ramped supply to meet that demand. Despite the sequential improvement in deal timing, on a year-over-year basis project timing and our APAC team reorganization continue to weigh on our systems business growth.\nRegardless, we remain confident in the quality and size of our opportunities, and our pipeline is strong. Turning to eternal inventory, we reduced our overall inventory position by $1.4 million, led by an endpoint IC inventory reduction that exceeded expectations. We continue to forecast further overall inventory reductions for -- in the second half of 2018. Turning now to the market, I am energized by the many opportunities in front of us.\nFor example, in June, the International Air Transport Association mandated RAIN baggage tracking for all 283 IATA member airlines. For years, innovative airline-community members, including Delta Airlines, London Heathrow, and Las Vegas' McCarran Airport, have proven real-world ROI for systems-level RAIN deployments. IATA estimates the full-scale worldwide baggage-tracking rollout will save the industry more than $3 billion over the next seven years. We are well-positioned to benefit from that rollout.\nBut what really energizes me is the airline industry bringing the benefits of RAIN-enabled item connectivity directly to people, as evidenced by Delta's Track My Bags feature and the Fly Delta application. I look forward to the day when businesses regularly extoll the benefits of RAIN connectivity to their customers. On the topic of new products, in the second quarter we released a beta version of Impinj Speedway Connect software that delivers tag direction for xSpan gateways and tag location or direction for our xArray gateways. The production version of Speedway Connect is available now.\nSpeedway Connect offers a subset of ItemSense's capabilities for up to six gateways per deployment, helping our partners bring RAIN solutions to market by simplifying system configuration and delivering tag direction or location to end-customer applications. Our partners can operate -- upgrade Speedway Connect to ItemSense as a deployment grows in size or scope. Speedway Connect is one of many products our engineering team is hard at work developing for our platform road map. I want to remind investors that new products typically take time to become a significant percentage of revenue, so we continue to expect that new products will not materially affect 2018 revenue.\nTurning briefly to tariffs, the U.S. imposition in late August of a new round of tariffs products manufactured in China affects one pre-Monza R6 endpoint IC wafer product and only those wafers that our inlay partners import and assemble in the U.S. We shipped enough additional inventory to the U.S. before the tariffs came in effect to accommodate anticipated customer demand through the end of 2019.\nFor the longer term, we are evaluating our supply chain and sourcing options. On the organizational side, we welcome Dan Gibson from Sylebra Capital Management to our board. We look forward to leveraging Dan's financial, market, and Asia-region insights. Additionally, we ended the quarter with 241 issued and allowed patents, which we view as a key asset and a core strength of our business.\nAs noted in our August 2 press release, Impinj's board of directors commenced an independent investigation in connection with a complaint filed by a former employee. Our audit committee retained independent counsel to assist in that investigation and also advised the Securities and Exchange Commission of the investigation. I'm happy to say that that investigation recently concluded with no material findings. Impinj operates by the highest ethical principles, and the investigation's outcome reaffirms my confidence in our team and in the ethics by which we run our business.\nThe investigation's conclusion means we can now turn our full attention to growing and scaling our business. In summary, I'm pleased with the Impinj team's execution in the second quarter. We outperformed our guidance on revenue, EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and inventory, and we continue to believe that first half of 2018 was the turning point for our business. I want to close by thanking every Impinj employee for their focus and dedication to executing our vision of identifying, locating, and authenticating every item in our everyday world.\nI will now turn the call over to Eric for our detailed financial review and third-quarter outlook. Eric?\nEric Brodersen -- President, Chief Operating Officer, and Principal Financial Officer\nThank you, Chris. Except for revenue, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, today's statement of operations is on a non-GAAP basis. All balance-sheet and cash-flow metrics on a GAAP basis. A reconciliation between our non-GAAP and GAAP measures, as well as how we define our non-GAAP measures, is included in our earnings release available on our website.\nSecond quarter of 2018 revenue was $28.5 million, compared with $25.1 million in the prior quarter. Our second-quarter revenue mix was 70% endpoint ICs and 30% systems. As a reminder, the latter includes reader ICs, readers, gateways, and software. This mix compares with 77% and 23% respectively in the prior quarter.\nEndpoint-IC revenue was up 3% and systems was up 51% compared with the prior quarter. Second-quarter gross margin was 50%, compared with 49.2% in the prior quarter, with product mix the primary driver of the sequential improvement. Total second-quarter operating expense was $18.3 million, compared with $19.5 million in the prior quarter. Research and development expense was $7.1 million, sales and marketing expense was $7.0 million, and general and administrative expense was $4.2 million.\nWe ended the quarter with 278 employees, compared to 284 at the end of the prior quarter. And as of June 30, 2018, our first-quarter restructuring plan is substantially complete, as we executed a sublease for our vacant office space. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $4.0 million, compared with a loss of $7.1 million in the prior quarter, and better than our guidance of a loss of $7.75 to $6.25 million for the quarter. GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $7.7 million.\nNon-GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $4.1 million, or $0.19 per share using a weighted-average diluted share count of $21.3 million shares. On the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with cash, cash-equivalents, and short-term investments of $52.8 million, compared to $57.9 million in the prior quarter. Our GAAP net loss was slightly offset by $3.8 million of noncash expenses, primarily stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization. Our accounts receivable balance was $20 million, up from $17 million in the prior quarter.\nInventory totaled $53.3 million, down $1.4 million from the prior quarter due to higher than forecasted revenue and improved operational execution. This inventory decrease is $3.4 million better than the approximately $20 million increase we had forecasted on our prior earnings call. We continue to expect overall inventory to decline through the second half of 2018. Turning to the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $33 and $34 million.\nWe expect adjusted EBITA to be a net loss of between $3.4 to $2.4 million. On the bottom line, we expected non-GAAP loss of between $3.6 and $2.6 million and a non-GAAP loss of between $0.17 and $0.12 per share based on a weighted average diluted share count of 21.4 to 21.5 million shares. These non-GAAP-adjusted EBITDA and net-income numbers exclude any nonrecurring expenses associated with the audit committee investigation. And Yukio noted earlier, given how late we are on the quarter, we will defer questions regarding third-quarter trends and guidance to our next quarterly earnings call.\nI will now return the call to the operator for questions about our second-quarter 2018 results.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Troy Jensen of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nTroy Jensen -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nHey. Yeah. Gentlemen, first of all, congrats on the nice results.\nChris Diorio -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Troy.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nThank you, Troy.\nTroy Jensen -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nSo, Chris, maybe to start with you. I'd just be curious to know if you could hit on the verticals here. Just wondering if this Q3 surge is really retail for holiday season or if it's on a much broader base than just that?\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nTroy, this is Jeff. Perhaps I'll take the first cut at that and I'll -- I'll speak specifically to performance in the second quarter. And of course retail continues to be a significant driver of RAIN deployments, especially in apparel, but we're encouraged by the adoption of RAIN to solve business problems across a wide range of verticals, including healthcare, automotive, air transport, and others. So I would not call out any specific retail, any specific [Audio gap] as driving our performance in the second quarter.\nInstead, I'd speak to the broad adoption across multiple sectors.\nTroy Jensen -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nAll right. Perfect. The follow-up on that, just -- can you talk about the timing of the airline mandate with respect to when the revenues really start to ramp for you and others in the industry?\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nSure, Troy. It's a good question, and I'll refer to comments Chris made in the script. The International Air Transport Association, or IATA, as it's commonly known, has mandated RAIN baggage tracking for all of its 283 member airlines. Now, some of the early adopters and innovators have already deployed RAIN infrastructure and RAIN-based services, such as Delta Airlines, as Chris mentioned, London Heathrow, Las Vegas' McCarran Airport, but this -- this new initiative, this mandate across the entire industry will take a number of years to deploy at scale, but it is a clear definitive mandate to enable package tracking on a global basis.\nSo we're quite encouraged about RAIN adoption globally and we feel well-positioned to earn our fair share of that growing opportunity.\nTroy Jensen -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nPerfect. Let me ask, maybe a financial question for Eric or whosever in the room that can answer it. On the gross margin side, last year when you guys were doing this, kind of low- to mid-$30 million, you're getting 54% gross margins and I know it's probably different now, and we've seen some ASP erosion, but can you talk at all about, the business model now and I'd imagine you guys have much more confidence in spending more given that looks like we have turned, and certainly do see acceleration in the top line. So can you just help us out with what kind of the business model could look like, or a breakeven point or...\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nSure. I mean, we'll talk about Q2, Troy with, at $28.5 million, 50% margin, we're up sequentially with the growing margin over the prior-quarter Q1, which was $25.1 million. Mix is a big factor in margin for the quarter. We're not really commenting on go-forward and trends on this call today given the lateness in the quarter.\nChris Diorio -- Chief Executive Officer\nTroy, as we've said a couple of times, we're going to wait until the full-time CFO comes on, and they will have a hand in building out the longer-term financial model.\nTroy Jensen -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst\nAll right. Understood. Well, congrats on the nice rebound and good luck.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nThanks, Troy.\nChris Diorio -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Troy.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Anderson -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst\nYeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to start with sort of a two-parter on inventory.\nI'm just kind of curious on channel inventory, inlay partner inventory. At what point do you feel like a point of equilibrium is reached? Did you already reach it, or is it some time still between now and the end of the year? And then as far as your own inventory, you mention working that down, I wonder if there's targets we should be considering in terms of maybe inventory days or something like that just to sort of understand where you intend to take inventory. And then I've got a follow-up.\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nThanks, Charlie. This is Jeff. I'll take the first part of the question regarding channel endpoint inventory and then I'll pass it back to Linda to speak to Impinj inventory. As we said in the August 2 press release, we believe that our inlay partners' endpoint IC inventory adjustments are mostly resolved in the first half of 2018.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nAnd then, Charlie, taking your second question about our inventory trends, we were down $1.4 million this quarter, which was -- we actually expected to be up to $2 million this quarter. So we were $3.4 million better than what we expected. In the second half of the year, not -- we've said last quarter that we were expected to continue to drive inventory down through the year. We have not provided specific guidance on what that number may be at the end of the year other than that we would materially reduce inventory.\nCharlie Anderson -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst\nOK. Great. Then within the systems business, it looks like you're down a little bit year over year in gateway readers, but you seem to be up pretty decently the reader IC portion of the business, it appears. I wonder if those two are related -- maybe a market share loss on the reader gateway side results and higher reader IC business.\nI'm just trying to understand how we should think about those two in tandem in terms of what happened in the second quarter, and then any commentary go-forward would be helpful. Thanks.\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nSure. Thanks, Charlie, this is Jeff. Just to clarify, large-deal timing had an impact on a sequential ba -- quarterly sequential basis, which was favorable, but when you look at year over year, as comparisons, both deal timing and project timing had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year comparison. The pipeline is strong and we feel confident about the market opportunities for systems going forward.\nThe other impact that we've referred to in previous calls is the restructuring that we undertook in the Asia-Pacific region, which is well under way. Of course, the Japan team, as we mentioned in our last call, is solid and unchanged and productive. We did make changes in leadership and key team members in sales, solution engineering, and other technical resources and channel support in China. We remain very excited about the opportunity -- the growth opportunities in China.\nWe feel like we have an excellent leadership and team in place in China to take advantage of those opportunities going forward. The team is ramping well, but it did have an impact on a year-over-year comparison basis on the systems business.\nCharlie Anderson -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst\nCould you maybe speak to just the upside in the reader IC business? That appeared it was pretty up decently potentially in both sequentially and year over year?\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nYes. We started the year 2018 with clear growth in the reader IC demand and that continued in the second quarter. As Chris mentioned in his opening remarks, we've been able to substantially improve supply, which enable us to service that growth in demand and we feel good about the opportunities for the reader IC business going forward as well.\nCharlie Anderson -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst\nPerfect. Thanks so much.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nThanks, Charlie.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Chris Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nChris Hettenbach -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you. Question for Chris. Just in terms of the first half-year being a turning point, can you just talk about kind of your visibility, and as the business starts to recover, particularly as inventory's been cleaned up, how you're thinking about kind of near-term growth?\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nChris, this is Linda. I would say we as -- we as we noted last quarter on the call, we are taking it a quarter to time. So right now, we completed a solid quarter and we're guiding up for Q3 and that's about all we can say from a -- from a forward-statement perspective at this point in the quarter.\nChris Hettenbach -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. And then any other context around the Monza R6 in terms of that, from what it means to you from an inventory perspective or customer shipment?\nChris Diorio -- Chief Executive Officer\nChris, are you asking a tariff-related question?\nChris Hettenbach -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes.\nChris Diorio -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nSo Chris had in it our remarks already. It really relates to one pre-Monza R6 SKU that we have, and it's only when shipped to U.S.-based customers. So we have increased our inventory in the U.S. to mitigate -- mitigate tariff impacts in the near term, and we believe the tariff will be immaterial to our financial statements in the near term.\nChris Hettenbach -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.\nMike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks. Just one on the Q3 guidance walk-through. Can you help us just what you're assuming for the audit committee cost, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP, and are there any other one-time charges?\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nYes, Mike, great questions. So we have in -- in our filed documents we have the one-time charge of $1.75 million for estimated investigation costs related to the matter. We have filed that, and we also have reconciliations from our GAAP to non-GAAP and adjusted EBITDA, which includes primarily stock comp and depreciation and then that $1.75 million of investigation cost.\nMike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nOK. Great. Thank you. And then just on the -- on the business, any -- any view on just the competitive environment? NXP's remaining independent, there's been some price pressure in the industry.\nCan you just maybe just discuss on a high level anything on the competitive environment during Q2?\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nYeah. This is Jeff. I'll answer that question and say we haven't seen any material change in the market dynamic, including competition in the second quarter.\nMike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nOK. Great. And last question for me and I'll pass it on. Just how we view the business with first half for clearing the inventory now we're returning, maybe to some year-over-year growth in Q3 with your guidance.\nJust how do you see long term, maybe business, just your view without giving guidance, just the view of maybe when the company would return to growth, kind of in line with industry unit growth? Thank you.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nYes. So, Mike, this is Linda. As we've said in our prepared remarks, we're deferring questions at this point regarding future trends and guidance to our next quarterly earning calls, given -- given how late we are in the quarter. So I appreciate that -- I appreciate the question and we'll be happy to discuss that topic further on our 3Q call.\nMike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nOK. Great. Last question. And just on the with the audit committee review done, I'd assume that probably slowed any CFO search.\nCan you just update us maybe how far along you are in the process in terms of getting a new CFO in place?\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nSure. So we continue our CFO search. We've got several qualified candidates. I am in that pool of candidates.\nSo probably good to answer this Q&A, but the investigation did slow down a number of things, but I'd like to, again, thank the Impinj team for solid execution throughout this and focusing on the business and we look forward to 3Q.\nMike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions, and great to see there's nothing from the review. Appreciate it.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMitch Steves -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just starting first, I got two, but first on the system side of the business. Looks like that was up pretty materially sequentially, so I wanted to see if there is any sort of pull-in that happened in the quarter or that was actually the number you have expected for June?\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nSo, Mitch, your question was, systems business looks strong into 2Q '18, was there any unusual pull-in in the quarter. Is that ... ?\nMitch Steves -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n[Inaudible]\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nMitch, this is Jeff. No, I just -- the typical factors of deal timing and project timing impacted us favorably in 2Q.\nMitch Steves -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK. And that was on the systems side specifically, correct?\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nThat's correct.\nMitch Steves -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK. And then secondly, on the endpoints, can you just maybe update us on the ASP trends there? I know before your higher-end product was selling really well, so I just want to see A, if that's still the case and ASPs are increasing, and secondly, if there is any sort of pricing pressure in the area or in the endpoint sales?\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nMitch, this is Jeff again. There's been no material change in the pricing dynamics in the marketplace in 2Q. Of course, mix varies throughout the period according to end-project demand, but nothing material to report or discuss in 2Q.\nMitch Steves -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGot it. Perfect. Thank you.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nThanks, Mitch.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nThank you. Question about -- I just wanted to follow up on some of your comments about project timing. If we go back to the 2Q results, I am wondering if you can somehow, if you're in a position to contrast the level of activity that you're seeing in the market versus last year or is it -- are you seeing a level of activity that's more consistent with what you saw two years ago, in terms of larger deals, the funnel of opportunities? Can you answer that?\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nSure. This is Jeff. I would say that, in summary, I would say that we feel good about growth in market opportunities. We feel good about our -- the strength of our pipeline.\nWe feel good about our competitive position and in going after winning those market opportunities. I really want to reinforce that I think it's very typical as an enterprise platform provider to have the factor of larger deal timing and project timing, that is the acceleration or deceleration of projects according to end-customer deployment scheduling. Very typical and the net effect is we feel comfortable about our position and the opportunity and the growth opportunities ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you. And just more of a question on the level of demand that you've seen geographically. Is there anything you can say with respect to U.S.\nbusiness versus European business?\nJeff Dossett -- Senior Director of Strategic Planning\nWhat I would say is we see strength all around the globe. If I were to call out any -- any region specifically, we did see, in part as a result of the progress in our APAC reorganization and in China specifically, our engagement and visibility into the growth opportunities in China, in particular, continues to improve. I think much of that opportunity has existed for some time, but we feel really good about our level of engagement in that particular market. Our growing understanding of the unique growth opportunities that exist in China and we feel well-positioned with strong leadership and a strong team in China to take advantage of those opportunities in collaboration with our growing partner ecosystem in China.\nJim Ricchiuti -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you. And last question for me -- is there anything you can say, any color with respect to your Q3 guidance with respect to operating expense, R&D versus sales and marketing? I don't know how aggressively the R&D spending potentially is ramping up as it relates to your new product-development efforts looking out over the next year. Can you say anything, any further color on guidance with respect to R&D and sales marketing?\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nYeah, Jim, this is Linda. So we don't typically guide to opex and we'll stay consistent with that on our 3Q guide. So we have -- the trend that's out there for the last eight quarters that's probably a good thing to look at as far as our spend.\nJim Ricchiuti -- Needham & Company -- Analyst\nThank you.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nThank you.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nLinda Breard -- Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\nThank you all for joining the call today on such short notice. We would also like to thank the Impinj team for all of your hard work, your dedication, and solid execution this quarter.
