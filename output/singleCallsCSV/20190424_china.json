Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wilson. Please ask your question.\nBob Wilson --  -- Analyst\nYes, thank you and good morning. Your R&D and selling expenses continued to go down in the fourth quarter. However your G&A expenses went up significantly. Do you think the outstanding receivables may be at risk?\nDixon Chen -- Investor Relations\n(Foreign Language).\nZhiwei Zhao -- Chief Executive Officer\n(Foreign Language).\nDixon Chen -- Investor Relations\nThe increase of G&A expense is mainly due to the bad debt provision for the security deposit in our former commodity trading business. This is a one-time non-recurring event. As we are not sure whether the deposit -- the security deposit will be achieved, we made such adjustment in our book. But again, it's a one-time adjustment, and so that's causing an increase on the G&A expenses for the fourth quarter.\nBob Wilson --  -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you. Also your advertising business had a strong quarter. Do you think you can continue to grow them into a major revenue source like other portal companies?\nDixon Chen -- Investor Relations\n(Foreign Language).\nZhiwei Zhao -- Chief Executive Officer\n(Foreign Language).\nDixon Chen -- Investor Relations\nReviewing Alexa's ranking of the mainstream websites, the influence (ph) of our website continued to rise. The stronger influence is now being translated into increase of advertising revenue, which is a very good encouraging sign for us. At the meantime, we are also broadening our offerings by introducing more novel models, including ThinkTac for financial information services, news dissemination and distribution and investment opportunity discovery. Our goal remains to provide mass investors and public companies with enriched -- with enriched services, better user experience and enhance the user value.\nBob Wilson --  -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you.\nDixon Chen -- Investor Relations\nThank you.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Pat Murphy. Please ask your question.\nPat Murphy --  -- Analyst\nHi guys. The Chinese stock market is having an amazing rebound this year. Do you expect your revenues from individual subscription and advisory services will pick up in a significant way in 2019?\nDixon Chen -- Investor Relations\n(Foreign Language).\nZhiwei Zhao -- Chief Executive Officer\n(Foreign Language).\nDixon Chen -- Investor Relations\nIn order to promote long term health and development of our investment advisory business, we implemented and introduced a series of upgrades and optimizations of our customer acquisition, content development and team building in 2019. Since then we have noticed the significant improvement with the reinvigorated marketing sentiment and investor confidence, the restored investment confidence, we are upbeat that the future -- on the future of our investment advisory business.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Your next question again from the line of Pat Murphy, please ask your question. Hello, Mr. Murphy.\nPat Murphy --  -- Analyst\nHello.\nOperator\nYes, go ahead. Hello, Mr. Murphy, your line is open. Please ask your question. Hello Mr. Murphy, your line is now open. Please ask your question again.\nPat Murphy --  -- Analyst\nOkay. Apparently the performance of your Robo-Advisor is outstanding. What kind of strategies do you -- does your program imply to achieve a positive return in a massive down market? How are they doing this year?\nDixon Chen -- Investor Relations\n(Foreign Language).\nZhiwei Zhao -- Chief Executive Officer\n(Foreign Language).\nDixon Chen -- Investor Relations\nSince you talk about our Robo-Advisor, since its inception Lingxi has not only consistently outperformed the Shanghai Composite Index, but continuously beaten the majority of the peer product in the marketplace as well. In 2018 the Shanghai Index suffered massive loss of nearly 25%. But 95% of our Lingxi investment strategies produced positive returns. And one of our defensive strategies returned an annual growth of over 5%.\nSo from 2017 to the end of 2018 the best performing strategy of Lingxi reached a positive 17% return. So these are encouraging to see. To sum it up, the success of Lingxi is attributable to our fintech resource accumulation in the past years and also our commitment to developing best-in-class asset allocation system. Lingxi is essentially built upon these five star strategies from our proprietary asset allocation systems. So with this kind of level of success we're seeing in the last, about two years performance, we now look forward to introduce these products to our institutional clients, and further empowering their wealth management businesses with our technologies.\nOperator\nThis will be the end of our question-and-answer.
