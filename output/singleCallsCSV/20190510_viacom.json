Please note that in addition to our press release, we have trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.We also have an accompanying slide presentation that you can follow along with our remarks. I want to refer you to the Slide number 1 in the presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.And now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorThanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. And thank you again for joining us. During the quarter, Viacom continued to focus on execution and evolution, making significant progress on both. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we made in distribution, where we secured both expanded and new distribution agreements, as well as with the quick integration of Pluto TV into our business, where we are already seeing great traction. I'll update you on both areas in detail in a moment. But first, a brief overview of the financials and some key operating highlights from the quarter.Financially, we delivered strong metrics in multiple areas, telling a story of continued momentum at Viacom. Domestic ad revenue improved sequentially to minus 2% year-over-year, as we continue to track our return to full year 2019 ad revenue growth. Domestic affiliate revenue was down slightly this quarter, close consistent with our expectations and remains on track for full year growth. Total revenue was a bit soft as we felt the impact of some rather significant international headwinds and timing issues. That said, we see a strong return to growth in the second half. Notably, at the adjusted OI level, Paramount delivered its ninth straight quarter of improvement and adjusted diluted EPS grew by 3%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth.Moving to operating highlights. I want to start with Paramount. Here, we see continued momentum. Paramount improved year-over-year adjusted OI by $20 million driven by continued benefit from the performance of Bumblebee an increased monetization of our film library. Based on this year's slate performance, we continue to expect a return to full year 2019 profitability. And looking ahead, we're feeling great about the remainder of the significant 2019 releases.Currently, in theaters is the adaptation of Stephen King's Pet Sematary, and it's performing well. At the end of the month, it's the Elton John musical biopic Rocketman, which is already generating a ton of positive buzz, and in August we have Dora and the Lost City of Gold, a live action film from Nickelodeon's Dora the Explorer franchise. On the TV side, Paramount also continued its success this quarter, scoring a Season 3 renewal of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan from Amazon, and a Season 2 pickup of The Haunting of Hill House from Netflix.Second, domestic audience performance. Here in an evolving video landscapes, our brands continue to occupy critical market positions and exhibit strong performance, both in pay-TV and beyond. In the quarter, Viacom maintained a number one share of U.S. basic cable viewing among key demos. Kids, teens, 18 to 34s, 2 to 49s, and African Americans. And we had more top 30 original cable series than any other cable family.Overall, our flagship networks continue to deliver growing share 2% year-over-year with strong results of Comedy Central, MTV and Paramount Network. And while Nick remains in work in progress, it is still the number one kid's network by far. And the first shows from Nick's new slate have begun to air with encouraging early signs from the substitute and Ryan's Mystery Playdate. In fact, we've already ordered Season 2 O'Brien following its strong debut.Looking beyond TV, Viacom Digital consumption continues to grow dramatically. In the quarter, Viacom Digital Studios delivered 6.4 billion video views accounting for watch time of almost 10 billion minutes, up 69% and 153% year-over-year respectively. As part of that, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central both recorded their best quarters ever. And we now rank number eight in global social video views according to Tubular's media and entertainment rankings up from number 15 a year ago.Third, domestic ad sales. Domestic ad sales improved sequentially for the second straight quarter, driven by continued strength in Advanced Marketing Solutions or AMS, which grew revenues 76% year-over-year. Looking to the full year, we continue to expect our AMS business now including Pluto TV to nearly double its revenue in fiscal '19 representing nearly 20% of domestic ad sales, as we bring more new advanced ad inventory online across our growing portfolio. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver 2019 fiscal full year domestic ad sales growth, and expect to deliver growth in the current quarter. Worth noting, Q3 will be the first quarter of ad sales growth in five years, and the beginning of a new era of ad sales growth at our company.Fourth, domestic distribution. Here, we achieved significant gains in distribution and are reaffirming our full year domestic affiliate revenue outlook of low single-digit growth. Our confidence in full year results is driven by renewals, rate escalators, vMVPD growth, content licensing, the scaling of our subscription products and inclusion of new mobile and virtual MVPDs, which brings me to two areas I want to spend a bit more time on, distribution and Pluto that are critical to our continued success, and two areas where the transformation of Viacom is clearly coming to light.Let's start with distribution. (technical difficulty) 2017, we've talked about how consumers with segment by price point across the evolving distribution landscape and is access to new content package and delivery options has grown, we introduced a strategy to ensure Viacom brands and IP would be represented on all of them.Our most recent quarter reflects this exact trend and clearly demonstrates Viacom's rapid and successful evolution in this new distribution landscape. At the core of the success is both content, the combination of Viacom's vibrant brands, IP and creative capabilities, and partnership, our passion for working with companies in utilizing our assets to create value both for clients and ourselves.So with that as a backdrop, let's talk about what we achieved in the quarter. First, the big bundle. For the past couple of quarters, it was noise in the industry about what may or may not happen in our AT&T, DirecTV renewal. And people pointed to this as a big overhang on the stock. Well, as all of you now know at the end of March, we concluded a new long-term deal with AT&T, which included broad and deep carriage of Viacom brands on both DirecTV and U-verse, which together represent the largest share of MVPD big bundle subscribers in the industry. In fact, including this deal, my management team has now renewed or extended the vast majority of Viacom's traditional sub base.Second, virtual MVPDs and skinny packages. This is an important sector of the pay-TV industry, and during the quarter, Viacom secured several important wins. Let's start with AT&T. As part of our deal, Viacom ensured ongoing carriage in all legacy DirecTV Now packs and importantly inclusion in the new DirecTV Now Plus and Max offerings. Note that we are the only non-broadcast family to be there, other than AT&T's own Turner Networks.Viacom's global portfolio also gained carriage on fuboTV's live TV streaming service, as it decided to add our leading entertainment portfolio to its previously sports focused offering. Here, we added over a quarter million new subs as of April. In addition, Viacom networks were a core part of the launch of Charter's Spectrum TV Essentials, a low cost entertainment only bundle targeting broadband only customers. So, we've had a lot of activity in this space. Activity which clearly illustrates the value of Viacom networks in skinny bundles. Third is our expansion in mobile. Over the past two years, we've talked about mobile as a potentially significant growth catalyst for pay-TV content suppliers, as mobile telcos look for ways to drive data packages and differentiation. The good news is we're in the very early stage of seeing that opportunity come to live, and Viacom brands are clearly in the mix.As proof points to this, as part of our AT&T, DirecTV renewal, AT&T recently expanded AT&T Watch product to include MTV, Nickelodeon and TV Land. These networks joined the six we launched on the platform last summer. In addition, during the quarter, we announced the content distribution agreement with T-Mobile, in which Viacom brands will play a key role in T-Mobile's forthcoming mobile video service. And remember, T-Mobile, now has the subscriber base of over 80 million customers. So, this is a partnership with a lot of potential for us. Viacom's activity in mobile also continues to grow outside the U.S. In fact, Viacom International Media Networks now has 22 mobile-only content deals with 18 operators across 30-plus countries, a clear sign that our flagship brands are getting significant traction on mobile networks.And fourth in distribution is SVOD direct-to-consumer. Here, we continue to advance our strategy on multiple levels. Our rapidly growing Studio Production business is feeding a growing pipeline of original content to third-party SVOD players. For example, in addition to the Paramount TV renewals I mentioned earlier, Awesomeness Studio premiered PEN15 to rave reviews and announced Season 2 renewals of both PEN15 and Lighter Than a Feather on Hulu. We now are significant original programming suppliers to Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Hulu among others.At the same time in the owned and operated SVOD space, our distribution continues to grow. To that end, Apple recently announced the new Apple TV app will include four of our SVOD services, as part of Apple TV channel, Nickelodeon's Noggin, Nick Hits, Comedy Central Now and MTV Hits. In addition, outside the U.S., we announced our first Latin American distribution partners for Paramount+ which is our cross-brand streaming video service. With NET and Claro in Brazil, know that NET is both Brazil's largest MVPD and number two broadband provider, while Claro is among the largest mobile and broadband providers across all of Latin America. It's also worth noting that Noggin has now passed 2.5 million subs globally, and that a new enhanced version is launching this summer, which brings me to the focus of my second detailed topic, Pluto TV.Here, our integration is moving swiftly and going exceptionally well. And Pluto's growth is showing strong early momentum. In fact, since we announced the acquisition, Pluto TV's leadership in free streaming TV has only grown, when we announced the acquisition of Pluto TV in late January in at 12 million monthly active users. By the end of April, Pluto TV had approximately 16 million monthly actives, a 31% increase in three months, and we have tens of millions of additional Pluto TV enabled devices coming online over the next few months. So, there is strong growth ahead.And it's not just usage. We're already making demonstrable progress on advertising monetization. Pluto TV has instantly added billions of ad impressions per month to the Viacom portfolio and these are high value impressions. The audience skews young and is diverse, and the impressions are overwhelmingly delivered on the TV glass in long form premium content, which means it is a high quality advertising environment. And while it's early, we're already seeing positive traction with advertisers which drove strong scattered volume in March and April. In addition, Pluto TV is also now an integral and compelling part of our upfront offering, helping to differentiate Viacom.In fact when you look at Pluto TV in combination with our networks, Viacom has expanded its reach particularly against hard to reach younger demos. For example, with Pluto, we now reached 80% of all 18 to 34s in the U.S. across our linear, digital and social products. This is the broadest reach we have ever had. And with this growth comes greater value for our advertising partners and for Viacom. And speaking of partners, we're also seeing strong early traction with Pluto TV when it comes to distributors.For Viacom, Pluto TV was always more than a D2C play. We saw it as an opportunity to broaden our partnerships with existing distributors and our early experience has proven just that. Comcast recently announced inclusion of Pluto TV in its Xfinity Flex service, which is available to Internet-only subs, and Pluto TV will be coming to Xfinity X1 soon.We have a second deal already signed with another large distributor, which we will announce at a later date and a few more in the pipeline. Things are moving quickly as distributors have come to understand the value of extending the Viacom partnership to Pluto TV. Supporting all of this is our expanding Pluto TV premium content offering. On May 1st, we launched Viacom library content on Pluto TV in a big way, adding 14 new channels with more to come. Viacom's extensive library of iconic IP is now featured through unique categories of branded channels expanding the Pluto TV content offering. Note that our freshest products remain in the pay-TV domain on our branded networks.In addition, in the last two months, we have significantly grown our roster of content partners, which now number over 150. Most recently, this includes the addition of CNN, BBC and Major League Soccer, and we see more opportunities ahead including the July launch of Pluto Latino, a U.S. Hispanic offering which include a set of specialized Spanish language channels, unlocking an entirely new segments for the business, which brings me to Pluto TV's international potential. We see a significant opportunity in leveraging Viacom's global operating footprint to drive Pluto TV's growth.To that end, we're currently launching the Pluto TV offering in Switzerland and expanding Pluto TV in the UK, Germany and Austria, where it is already launched. In addition, we'll have a Latin American launch in calendar 2019 and additional territories in 2020. And by the way, it's worth noting that the first AVOD product we got involved with. Viacom18's Loot service in India just crossed 50 million monthly active users and is now targeting 100 million in the next year.So, as you can see, there's a lot going on with Pluto. But big picture, the thing that really excites us is that we see Pluto TV as an opportunity to create a platform, a platform for content owners to exhibit their IP on, a platform upon which to create a very substantial advertising business, a platform from which to upsell consumers targeted SVOD and other products, and a platform to work with distributors to create incremental value in broadband, mobile and video sub bases both through advertising and by upselling additional video products. It's a powerful idea and it's a global one.The best news is we're already on our way, and that's why we're going to lean into it harder and invest some incremental money in 2019 to take advantage of the momentum we're already seeing, to capitalize on and extend our early leadership position.With that, let me turn it over to Wade to take you through our financials.Wade Cullen Davis -- Executive VP & CFOThanks Bob. As Bob just discussed, we made a lot of progress in the evolution of our company this quarter. It's really exciting for us that our strategies for the transformation of our business, the associated investments that we're making to support these strategies are beginning to pay off at a scale that's now being reflected on our consolidated financial performance. This momentum will continue to build in the second half of our fiscal year and we expect it will fully offset any headwinds associated with our linear business and drive overall top line revenue growth on a constant currency basis.On a consolidated basis which you can see on Slide 9, we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted EPS growth. This growth benefited from the continued improvement in Paramount adjusted OI, lower interest expense from our aggressive deleveraging and the bottom line impact of our ongoing cost transformation efforts. Beyond the P&L, we've driven very significant cash flow improvements where year-to-date free cash flow of $642 million is up over $400 million versus the prior year.Moving to the segment results on Slide 10. I'll start with Filmed Entertainment. The team at Paramount continues to deliver on the turnaround where adjusted OI of $29 million improved $20 million over the prior year, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of OI improvement. This quarter's profitability growth was driven by increased monetization of our library as well as the performance in carryover titles including Bumblebee.Total Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 1%, a stronger theatrical and ancillary revenue was offset by lower licensing revenue.Theatrical revenue more than tripled, primarily benefiting from the impressive carryover performance of Bumblebee. Ancillary revenue grew 75% or $38 million, due principally to a new music rights agreement. The decline in licensing revenue was a result of the timing of delivery of Paramount TV product as well as comparisons to last year's direct-to-SVOD released certain films.Now turning to Media Networks which is on Slide 11. My comments on Media Networks will be in constant currency terms. Please refer to our earnings release for detail on our reported results. Worldwide media networks' revenue declined 5% and adjusted operating income declined 4%, where we partially offset revenue declines with lower expenses. The improvement in expenses is due to the timing and mix of original programming and savings from our cost transformation efforts.Moving to domestic ad sales. The growth rate improved sequentially to a decline of 2% year-over-year. The sequential improvement was driven by accelerating growth in Advanced Marketing Solutions, partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of unfavorable impact from Easter falling later this year. AMS revenues increased 76% in the quarter compared to 54% in the December quarter. The impact that AMS is having on our domestic ad sales performance is an example of our focused and consistent execution against our stated strategies.Fiscal 2018 was AMS' first full year of operation and it delivered over $300 million of revenue, and we're on track to nearly double AMS this year, where it will represent around 20% of our domestic ad sales business. Given the scale and growth rate for the AMS business, we expect it to fully offset any linear headwinds for the balance of the year driving full year domestic ad sales growth. Domestic affiliate revenue declined 2% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline is largely due to the absence of library licensing to third-party as SVOD distributors, which we halted as we finalized our content strategy from Pluto. Beyond this, contractual rate increases were largely offset by subscriber declines. They're going to step back. And as Bob mentioned in his remarks, this was an excellent quarter for us in the execution of our distribution strategy.Deals we secured this quarter significantly de-risk the linear component of our business and set us up for consistent and predictable annual contractual rate increases for years to come. We also executed a number of agreements providing meaningful incremental penetration on new platforms, which will be an additional source of growth as our networks are lit up on these services.On slide 12 of the deck, we have an overview of international media networks, where total revenue declined 13% in the quarter. While revenue performance was soft, we have clear line of sight to meaningful growth in the back half of the year. International ad sales declined 6% in the quarter. While Channel 5's momentum continued achieving its third consecutive quarter of growth in viewership share, the UK ad marketplace continued to be soft given the macroeconomic uncertainty. Excluding the UK, international advertising revenues grew 2% in the quarter.Looking ahead for the June quarter, we expect to return to growth in international ad revenue driven by a handful of specific factors including modest improvement in the UK TV ad market which we're already seeing. Contractual UK ad sales commitments that are not marketplace dependent and ongoing strong growth at Telefe driven by the political advertising cycle in Argentina.International affiliate revenue was down 13% in the quarter. The decline was due to the timing of SVOD and OTT deliveries. We have significant deliveries of SVOD and OTT content plans in the back half of the year, which will yield a return to growth in the international affiliate revenue.Now, turning back to the consolidated results, and looking at the items below the line. Net interest expense was lower by $25 million due to the continued deleveraging actions. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5% which was comparable to the prior year.On Slide 13, there's the summary of our cash flow and debt. Our free cash flow generation year-to-date has increased significantly to $642 million compared to $235 million a year ago. The growth in free cash flow was largely a function of improved working capital management and timing of certain production spend.Moving to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had $9 billion of gross debt outstanding, a reduction of 11% compared to the prior year quarter. Our adjusted gross debt reflecting the equity credit we received from S&P and Fitch on our hybrid securities, was $8.3 billion.Turning to the remainder of the fiscal year. Now that we've closed on the Pluto transaction and are significantly into the integration phase, we're incorporating the impact of Pluto into our guidance. For the full year, we see total company revenue growth in the low to mid single-digits on a constant currency basis, with growth at Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. This updated guidance reflects slightly lower growth in Filmed Entertainment revenue than previously anticipated, due to shifting the release dates of certain titles out of FY '19 and into FY '20.In terms of domestic affiliate revenue, we reaffirm our expectations for growth in the low single-digits for full year 2019. Domestic affiliate revenue will benefit from rate escalators, virtual MVPD growth, content licensing and the scaling of our subscription products. We also continue to expect growth in domestic ad sales for the full year, driven by meaningful growth in the June and September quarters. While we have seen lower linear impression delivery, principally driven by Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite, this softness will be more than offset by accelerating growth in our AMS business including the benefit from the Pluto TV,.As I mentioned earlier, the scale and growth rate of our AMS business is now significant enough to mitigate ecosystem headwinds currently impacting the linear business. But beyond the growth of AMS, our linear business will benefit in the back half of the year from Easter holiday timing and advertiser mix shifts including increased volume from the studio category, which will result in higher weighted average price increases. Additionally, we expect to benefited from improved viewership share in Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite as the new management teams' programming strategy comes on air. But it's only been two months since we acquired Pluto TV, we have made significant progress on the integration, which is already manifesting in the marketplace.The strategic fit, audience momentum and associated financial results are already outperforming our initial expectations. We continue to see Pluto as a $1 billion opportunity as we expand the content offering, grow audience, launch new international services and enhance monetization. Based on the results we're already seeing, we're more bullish than ever. Inclusive of Pluto, the meaningful top line growth we will be delivering across the board in the second half of the year will require modest incremental investment. Because of this investment combined with the macroeconomic headwinds that impacted our first half international results and the increased purchase price amortization associated with Pluto, we now expect full year total company adjusted operating income to decline in the low to mid single-digits.We continue to expect to return to profitability at Filmed Entertainment. In wrapping up, I want to know the extent to which the strategies we've implemented to layer growth initiatives on top of the stabilized core business are paying off. We have been and will continue to be disciplined and relentless in the execution of our stated strategies. We're halfway through our fiscal third quarter and I couldn't feel better about the return to growth that we're seeing across our businesses.And now, we'll take your questions.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:OperatorThank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) our first question today is coming from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please proceed with your questions.Richard Greenfield -- BTIG. -- AnalystHi. Thanks for taking the question. So, I just want to make sure I understand the commentary on the drop from 5% growth in domestic affiliate last quarter year-over-year to the down 2% this quarter. Is that entire exchange due to SVOD licensing? Are there other non-recurrings, I don't remember you being a big licencor to things like Netflix or Hulu?So, just maybe I guess that the larger question is, what exactly is in your affiliate revenue line and how should we think about growth beyond 2019, now that you've renewed almost all of your deals, given that it seems like it's more than just the traditional distribution deals that are in there? So, if you could just help us with those pieces that would be great.Wade Cullen Davis -- Executive VP & CFOYeah. Sure, Rich. Thanks for your question. So, look, first, I want to reiterate what a successful quarter this was for us on the affiliate side, as we secured both expanded and new distribution agreements. And the deals we secured in the quarter including AT&T, really de-risk the linear component of our business and set us up for consistent and predictable annual contractual rate growth.Now, to your question. Probably, the best way to do it because you're all trying to do it, is look at Q1 versus Q2. In total, as you know and as you stated Rich, Q1 at 5% growth versus Q2's minus 2%. Within that, the core in Q1 was plus 2% and the core in Q2 is flat and then the balance the non-core in Q1 was plus 3% and in Q2 was minus 2%. So, let's talk about that.In reverse order, non-core. In Q2, we halted library SVOD licensing as we finalize the Pluto strategy, which cost us 200 basis points versus the prior year. And as I indicated by the numbers in Q1 non-core was a bit of a tailwind, again not massively but it shifted from tailwind to headwind. In terms of the core looking at Q2, as we said -- as I just said, it was flat. Within that, subs were negative in the 1.5% to 2% range which was consistent with our prior quarter. So, the driver of the core being flat is really the difference in the quarters, is really renewal activity in the second quarter. Beyond that, I can't really say as we take our confidentiality agreements very seriously.Now, pivoting to the future, which is the second part of your question really. In terms of our 2019 outlook as you know, we reaffirmed low single-digit full year domestic affiliate growth and as part of that we'll see sequential improvement in the third quarter. Why do we see that? A number of reasons. First, we renewed with all major distributors, which means we have predictability in terms of the positive impact of built-in rate escalators. Note that on the subscriber side, we're assuming very modestly higher sub declines in the back half of the year and this is all incorporated into our guidance.Second, we see continued benefit from vMVPDs both as we benefit from growth in places where we already work as well as from the new deals we struck in the second quarter, which of course include Charter Spectrum TV Essentials, fuboTV and the DirecTV Now Plus and Max offerings. We also anticipate a benefit later in the year from the forthcoming launch from T-Mobile.Third, we'll also benefit from our portfolio of subscription products continuing to scale, as we've added incremental distribution including from Apple channels as well as growing our portfolio of offerings which will include a new version of Noggin and the launch of MTV Hits both in June. But stepping back from all this Rich, this is another example where we clearly articulated a strategy. we've been executing against it and we are delivering results, and the strategy included broadening our partnerships with our existing distributors to unlock new opportunities and it's driving to accelerate our participation in next generation platforms including OTT and mobile to broaden consumer access to our brands and IP. Both of those elements put together are driving growth in this changing landscape, both are reflected in our Q2 and of course beyond.Richard Greenfield -- BTIG. -- AnalystAnd just to be clear Bob, you're basically saying that 2020 you feel comfortable that in fiscal 2020 you're going to grow affiliates at some level above what you're going to do and so you said low single-digit growth for '19, but you think you're going to do better than that in fiscal 2020.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorSo, we have talked about 2019 and reaffirm that we have not given 2020's guidance yet, as we always do, we will give that as part of our fourth quarter call.Richard Greenfield -- BTIG. -- AnalystThank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Alexia Quadrani -- JPMorganHi. Thank you very much. Just a question to clarify what you said about the distributors, and I have a question on Paramount. On the distribution side, you've mentioned the annual contracted rate increased several times in your prepared remarks. I just want to clarify, I understand it correctly that even if you may have an initial reset your market rate you may or may not depending on the contract, we can assume that all of your contracts with distributors have some sort of builts-in annual rate escalators.And then just on Paramount which continues to outperform and do you really, really -- well better than expected. Can we -- at this point, have recycled all the films that were green-lit by the previous management teams and sort of how do you see the balance of sort of film for box office release versus content sold other venues sort of longer term?Wade Cullen Davis -- Executive VP & CFOSure Alexia (sic). So to your question, yes, all of our affiliate deals have built at annual escalators, they're in the 5.25% range. So, yes, that was true before that continues to be true.Now, with respect to Paramount, let me start by emphasizing just how forward Paramount has come, this really is a remarkable turnaround where the team has improved profitability by over $500 million in three years. And under Jim's leadership, this is again an iconic studio where people would bring in projects first. The slate going forward is strong, is really coming together. It's worth noting that Paramount was really the talk on CinemaCon last month in Las Vegas. We got incredible excitement showing pieces of Rocketman; Terminator, yes with Arnold; Gemini Man with Will Smith, Sonic with Jim Carrey; and Top Gun, once again with Tom Cruise's Need for Speed, just to name a few . So, distributors can't wait and of course the TV business continues to ramp quickly.To your question, yes, Wonder Park was the last of the legacy slate. We're feeling great about the studio and its trajectory.OperatorThank you. The next question is from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research.Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research, LLCThank you. Two questions. First, Bob and Wade, you both mentioned that you halted your content licensing strategy as you were closing the Pluto deal. So, are you resuming the strategy, have you changed it, any update there?And then on Pluto, can you talk about the CPM differential for these ads relative to linear ads, and any numbers you can put behind this for us? Thanks.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorSure. So, first, let me apologize to Alexia, because I just called her Marci, and anyway. Then Marci, hello and thank you for your question.Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research, LLCThank you.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorYou know in terms of library licensing as we said, we halted that as we finalized our Pluto strategy and again it wasn't really material, but it was a piece of business in the comp quarter. On a going forward basis, what we're going to do is we're going to really continue to work to optimize the returns on our library assets, we're going to look at the performance of those assets on Pluto, which by the way in the first, very short period has been very strong and we're going to look at other opportunities should they present themselves worth noting that Pluto product tends to be not exclusive. So, we have a lot of flexibility there.Wade Cullen Davis -- Executive VP & CFOYeah. And in terms of the CPM and some more color around the ad opportunity on the Pluto. So, in general, digital CPMs are higher than linear CPMs that's reflective of the ability to target those ads on a more direct basis. That's the case here with Pluto. We currently see CPMs in kind of the mid-teens to low-20s. The real opportunity with Pluto that was taking advantage of increasing the monetization of that inventory from just selling more of it right. So, this business as we said in the past, I mean, the rate at which is scaling and that audiences' engagement with the product, I mean it has billions of monthly impressions and the significant majority of those impressions are going unsold today.Obviously for years now, we've had a big focused on advanced advertising and Pluto is part of the advanced advertising business. So, the Pluto inventory rolls into the advanced media component of AMS and the investments that we've made in AMS is building out in advanced ad business, building out a sales force that knows how to sell these products, integrating it into our upfront cycles, all of these are things that allow us to be highly confident in our ability to take the unsold inventory that Pluto has right now and significantly ramp monetization on that.Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research, LLCGreat. Thank you.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Jessica Reif with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Jessica Reif Ehrlich -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThank you. I have two questions. Just kind of maybe following on the total advertising commentary with all of the different platforms, do you have AMS opening to (inaudible) part of (inaudible) result Comcast. Can you talk about how you use the different platforms as you renew your distribution deals, there's always an advertising component? When there is -- some of your inventories being used for some of the deals, can you talk about who sells the inventory, how that evolves, and how do you use that effectively in various distribution deals?And then on Paramount, just could you -- are you considering or would you consider joining any of the direct-to-consumer services, because some of the ones that have been announced clearly need to scale or is it all been reserved for Pluto? And then as part of Paramount, could you talk a little bit about China, do you think there'll be any backlash from the current situation, the current rate situation?Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorDo you want me to take that and then you take...Wade Cullen Davis -- Executive VP & CFOYeah.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorSo, with respect to -- and I think the question really is about how our advanced ad sales deals work with our distributors. So as Bob talked about in the earlier -- in his earlier remarks, the strategy with our distributors has been the focus on how we can broaden the nature of our relationship with them and bring value beyond and in ways that's complementary to the core content licensing. And so, as we have obviously all of the affiliate deals than any other content companies do have an advertising component. The difference here is that we've brought to bear our capabilities with respect to advanced advertising and products and the technologies that we have resident advantage and obviously that integrates with things that we've done like open Open AFP.So -- and the way those deals are structured are really to build out the enablement and the processes that allow both us and our distributors to be able to capture incremental value from pivoting from linear broadcast ads to advanced targetable addressable media on their footprint. And so in terms of who actually sells that were setting up those processes and procedures to allow both parties to sell them depending on who can bring the most value of equation in any given time. Paramount?Yeah. And just again very simply Jessica, there has been inventory that was sold by networks, i.e., nationals say Viacom and local since the beginning of time in pay-TV. It was local avails and national avails. That continues to be the case today. The operators sell local, we sell national. What's different today again as we've said is, we have now have a direct connection into a subset of the operators plant, which allows us to deliver dynamically different ads into set-top boxes versus all the ads being the same, and that gives you all kind of targeting yields and efficiency gains. So, that's there.On the Paramount side, look Paramount is both has a massive library on the film side. And as we said, it has real momentum on the current and future slate side. And what part of their business is monetizing that content out of, call it, first window. So if you look at it led by, in this case again, sale is there, we're constantly looking for opportunities to monetize that asset and that includes licensing product to all kind of folks including on the D2C side. And yes, we're using Paramount product on Pluto as well. And you should expect that hybrid ecosystem to continue as we look to maximize both P&L value and asset value.With respect to China, clearly a lot of noise about China in the broad market today, a big negotiation going on, creating some uncertainty. Look, I believe that'll play through, there's huge demand underlying for film product in China, you've seen it become very material as Chinese consumers love American film product, and don't anticipate any kind of long-term problem here. But of course, we will have to see how the trade negotiations plays out exactly.Jessica Reif Ehrlich -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of David Miller with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.David W. Miller -- Imperial Capital, LLCYeah. Hey, guys. Congratulations on the back half guidance there that you said, I appreciate the clarity. Jim, could you just talk briefly about the -- how many Paramount series you expect to deliver in the second half of this year, and how many Paramount series you will expect to deliver next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorYeah. So, this is Bob. I'll take the question.David W. Miller -- Imperial Capital, LLCSorry about that.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorYou know, look. No, no Problem. But as I said, we're tremendously excited about Paramount that extends to what the whole Clemons is doing on the television side. As you've seen, we continue to ramp volume there and I'll get to the numbers in second. But importantly, they really are not just recent volume, they're producing hits, one title I didn't mention in my prepared remarks which I'd encourage you to check out as Catch-22 which we made it for Hulu, the reviews of that series are off the charts and it's yet another example of the fantastic work with Paramount TV team is doing in this space.With respect to all of the numbers, again, very high growth business. We now have 22 shows order to or in production, which will be delivered over the coming period. This is a mix of shows for SVOD players like Netflix and Hulu and the like. We are making shows for our own networks including like our Boomerang to BET. We are making shows for traditional players, cable networks, both basic and premium, and there is just a lot of activity there. It is a fast growth business creating incredible product that has a very bright road ahead.David W. Miller -- Imperial Capital, LLCOkay. And then Bob, on the slate for Paramount for both the back half of this year and into next year for the expensive films like Terminator and Top Gun and so and so forth. Should we assume that most of those or all of those are co-pros with Skydance, or I mean are you thinking on partners to kind of defray the risk there or are those purely your films?Wade Cullen Davis -- Executive VP & CFOWhy don't I take the slate question. So, as you think everybody knows, we made a pivot, we made a decision to pivot away from a slate financing structure a couple of years ago. As we've evolved our slate strategy to really have a balance of big franchise films, co-branded films with our big flagship brands and smaller budgeted more targeted films, we've decided to really look at on picture by picture basis at co-financing opportunities.In the places that as you point out is that you really want to share risk are on the bigger budgeted films. And there is no shortage of demand for any of the big franchise films to bring in co-financing partners. A number of these films are co-financed with Skydance, but they're not the only co-financing partners that we have. But for -- really for every one of the big franchise films that we have upcoming in the fiscal '20 slate which is a significant number of big exciting films, each one of those more or less has some risk sharing through co-financing partners.David W. Miller -- Imperial Capital, LLCOkay. Wonderful. Thanks you very much.OperatorThank you. The next question is from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please proceed with your questions.Tim Nollen -- Macquarie BankThanks. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Nickelodeon and the turnaround that you have referred to previously there. TV and the progress you're making -- they're making at MTV, I think with a bit more of a digital first strategy there. What are you doing similarly or differently with Nickelodeon, I do see the share gains you mentioned, but if you could talk a little bit more about the digital versus the linear strategy shift please?Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorYeah. Sure. So, big picture, it's important that we note that we did grow our flagship share in the quarter overall in MTV and Comedy have really done well, Paramount networks is improving, and BET, we'll see some significant benefit as Tyler Perry comes online in the fall. And by the way to your point on MTV, it is both a traditional rating story and a digital story, it's worth noting that MTV's prime time ratings are up on the order of 50% over the last couple of years. So, MTV is clearly resonating on television as well as generating pretty extraordinary consumption off television.Now to your question on Nickelodeon, I'm happy to say Brian continues to do great work here. As you know he has rebuilt the team and also the pipeline of shows. The first effort to come to air which is Ryan's Mystery Playdate has quickly emerged as the number one preschool show on television and it also actually has broader traction with 2 to 11s which is great. Fully 25% of the audience of the show is new to Nickelodeon, also great. And if you look at the Live+7 lift, which I know is a little esoteric, but it's comparable to PAW Patrol. So, that says this show has real potential. And they have a lot more coming. They'll have almost 40% more original hours this summer versus last summer and the stuff looks great.Now, beyond TV, because as you said and consistent with our flagship strategy, it is about multiple platforms, not just linear TV and beyond TV, Nick continues to expand as well. Direct-to-consumer side, Noggin had just short of 500,000 U.S. subs in March that was up 23% versus the prior quarter and over 300% versus year ago.Also, as I mentioned we have a new version, which is now in beta, and it'll launch in June. That's a significant upgrade from the prior version. It's got a whole new user front end that will improve content discovery. It's got a big added gaming component, which is something that obviously consumers love that Noggin hadn't traditionally supplied. And then we also did a bunch of back end work there to improve scalability that of course won't be viewable by the consumer.It's not just B2C, Nickelodeon and its studio initiative also closed another animation deal with Netflix for two feature-length versions of RIP, in this case, Rocko and Invader Zim, and we're also expanding the portfolio of live events, most recently we expanded the JoJo Siwa D.R.E.A.M. The Tour by adding dates in market. So, I'm really excited about what's going on at Nick and looking forward to the quarters ahead .Tim Nollen -- Macquarie BankOh great. And 10 more original programming coming to the virtual bundle deals that you've been doing recently, exclusive original stuff from the likes of MTV Nickelodeon.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorWell, our flagship brands have a deep component of original content that are carried wherever those are carried in the pay-TV environment. So, yes, that of course will continue. I'm not sure what you're referring to in terms of any specific in these virtual bundle point.Tim Nollen -- Macquarie BankNo. I was just wondering if there is new digital production going to those virtual bundles from those studios.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorWell, when you talk about the virtual bundle like Charter...Tim Nollen -- Macquarie BankAnd with the mobile -- I was thinking more about the mobile deals that you've got like AT&T Watch and some of those.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorSo, the AT&T Watch is a traditional vMVPD, its a entertainment-only skinny delivered via mobile. So, you can think about that as the same configuration you would get on DirecTV as an example, just obviously fewer selections thankfully. We now have nine of services on that. So, no, there isn't a lot -- a lot of, there isn't a difference there.Tim Nollen -- Macquarie BankOkay. All right. Thank you.OperatorThank you. The next question is from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.John Hodulik -- UBSOkay. Great. Maybe first, Bob and Wade you guys both mentioned some increased investment going into the back half of the year. First, could you size that and maybe give us some more granularity on -- is it on the Pluto side or some of the content initiatives that you guys that Bob you just talked about?And then maybe over on Pluto. Yeah. Wade, you talked about the 50% of the inventory going unsold and the $1 billion opportunity, is the $1 billion opportunity just fully selling out that inventory at that $20 CPM and maybe executing on the international opportunity? And how quickly can you close that gap and sell that inventory up to 100%? Thanks.Wade Cullen Davis -- Executive VP & CFOSure. Why don't I start with the Pluto piece since it's a little bit with embedded in the modification of our guidance. So, yeah, I'm going to keep on relating this is a -- as the $1 billion opportunity. And when I highlighted it as a $1 billion opportunity, I really want to underscore that that's in the U.S. alone. And when we highlight the $1 billion opportunity, we are just doing simple math on today's users and comparable monetization rates. And so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in doing more aggressive math, but we highlighted those dynamics when we closed on the transaction, and it was 12 million monthly average uniques. Three months later for all -- that was the announcement. Three months later, it's 16 million monthly average unique. So in three months, it grew 30%. So, the momentum continues to grow there. And when we do talk about the $1 billion opportunity on that relatively simple math, that is the domestic market alone.So, as we scale up the infrastructure to accelerate growth internationally, the first material thing you're going to see us do there and it's going to happen in this calendar year is to launch Pluto in Latin America. We're also scaling up the infrastructure to accelerate the fairly nascent services that Pluto had in the UK and then as Germany, Austria and Switzerland countries. So, we are excited about this being a global opportunity as well and it's one that really leverages the infrastructure that we have.In terms of incremental investments and how that impacts our guidance, so there are two pieces that impacted the adjustment to our OI guidance for the year. By far the biggest of those is accelerating the investments that we're making in our growth initiatives, principally Pluto.So, given the momentum that we talked about, we're going to be making some significant relative to Pluto's spend, not significant in the scheme of things, but we will be making incremental investments in Pluto. Those investments are principally going to be in expanding the team. Mostly, with respect to the expansion of the team, it's really product and engineering. We're investing money in accelerating the integration process, particularly in the ad tech and data infrastructure areas that allows us to integrate and sell their inventory more fluidly across our entire pools of advertisers, particularly as we enter the upfront. And then we're going to have a range of incremental product releases over the course of the summer as we continue to improve the product to grow consumption and engagement.So, yeah, I guess with that, I'd like to turn it over to Bob just to wrap up the call.Robert Marc Bakish -- President, CEO & DirectorYeah. Thanks, Wade. And thanks everyone for your questions. Look, as I hope you heard today, the second quarter marked another period of strong execution and evolution at Viacom. We unquestionably have momentum in the core, including having secured meaningful distribution wins, both extending the existing relationships and creating new ones in the U.S. and beyond, which together broaden the footprint of our services. And importantly, we are on track to deliver on key previously stated objectives for the year, including audience share growth for our flagships, a return to full year advertising and affiliate growth at domestic media networks as well as full year profitability for Paramount.In addition, we see a strong second half for our international business, including a return to growth. At the same time, in this rapidly changing TV ecosystem, we're leaning more and more into the evolution of our company. In that regard, we're extremely excited about the consumption of our brands that we're seeing off TV, including across social media and in real life, as well as what we're beginning to see in the mobile distribution space. And there is unquestionable momentum at our key new businesses, AMS, studio production, and of course, D2C, including Pluto TV. These businesses are transforming the composition of our company.So, thanks again for your support. We look forward to continuing to update you as we go through this exciting second half of fiscal 2019.Wade Cullen Davis -- Executive VP & CFOWe want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.OperatorToday's conference has concluded.
