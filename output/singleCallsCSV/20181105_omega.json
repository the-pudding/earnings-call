All participants will be in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) Please note, today's event is being recorded.\nAnd at this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Michele Reber. Ma'am, please go ahead.\nMichele Reber -- Investor Relations\nGood morning. With me today are Omega's CEO, Taylor Pickett; CFO, Bob Stephenson; COO, Dan Booth; and Chief Corporate Development Officer, Steven Insoft.\nComments made during this conference call that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements such as statements regarding our financial projections, dividend policy, portfolio restructurings, rent payments, financial condition or prospects of our operators, contemplated acquisitions, dispositions or transitions and our business and portfolio outlook generally. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially. Please see our press releases and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, our most recent report on Form 10-K, which identifies specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call today, we will refer to some non-GAAP financial measures such as FFO, adjusted FFO, FAD and EBITDA. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measure under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as well as an explanation of the usefulness of the non-GAAP measures are available under the Financial Information section of our website at www.omegahealthcare.com, and, in the case of FFO and adjusted FFO, in our press release issued today.\nI will now turn the call over to Taylor.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Michele.\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Today, I will discuss our strategic asset repositioning and portfolio restructuring and our third quarter dividend.\nWe've made considerable progress toward completing our strategic asset repositioning and portfolio restructurings. In the first three quarters of 2018, we disposed of 71 facilities for a total consideration of $340 million. The revenue reduction related to these sales was $38 million, while the trailing 12-month cash flow on these assets was $26 million. The cash flow on these assets did not cover the underlying rent, yet we were able to achieve sale proceeds that equate to a cash flow yield of 7.6%.\nWe believe we're going to be able to redeploy these proceeds into higher-quality assets with good rate coverage, while experiencing minimal revenue impact. We will likely sell 10 to 15 additional facilities, but the bulk of our asset repositioning sales are now complete, excluding the ultimate outcome of the Orianna portfolio.\n23 (ph) of the 42 Orianna facilities have been transitioned or sold. 22 facilities have been released to five existing Omega operators, with related annual rent of $16.8 million. One facility in Tennessee was sold for $4.3 million. There are 19 facilities remaining that will be sold or released. We expect that these facilities will generate rent or rent equivalents in excess of $15 million, which is in line with our expectations and previous disclosures.\nWith the bulk of our asset sales and repositioning behind us, we expect that in 2019 acquisitions will meaningfully outpace dispositions as we return to our historical growth model.\nTurning to our third quarter dividend. Our third quarter dividend of $0.66 per share reflects a payout ratio of 85% of adjusted FFO and 96% of funds available for distribution. While these ratios are high from a historical perspective, we continue to feel comfortable with the payout ratio given that we incurred third quarter Orianna legal fees of $2 million in excess of our budget.\nI will now turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Taylor, and good morning.\nOur reportable FFO on a dilutive basis was $159 million or $0.76 per share for the quarter as compared to a loss of $47 million or a loss of $0.24 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Our adjusted FFO was $163 million or $0.77 per share for the quarter and excludes the impact of a $2 million recovery for uncollectible accounts, a $1.2 million mark-to-market loss on our Genesis warrants and $4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nOperating revenue for the quarter was approximately $222 million versus $220 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily a result of $8 million of incremental revenue from a combination of $445 million of new investments completed and capital renovations made to our facilities since the third quarter of 2017 as well as lease amendments made during that same time period and $4 million of revenue related to the Orianna transferred assets that were transitioned to existing Omega operators in the third quarter of 2018. Those two increases in revenue were partially offset by $8 million in reduced revenue, resulting from asset sales, transitions and loan payoffs that occurred since June of 2017.\nThe $222 million of revenue for the quarter includes $18 million of non-cash revenue. For revenue modeling purposes, we project our non-cash quarterly revenue will continue at approximately $18 million. We expect to transition the preferred care portfolio and generate annual revenue between $5 million and $6 million starting in late 2018 or early 2019. We expect the Orianna facilities to generate annual rent and rent equivalents of $32 million to $38 million when the restructuring is complete with over $4 million per quarter already completed related to the 22 legacy Orianna facilities that transitioned in Q3.\nOur G&A expense was $10.3 million for the quarter, which was $2.6 million greater than our third quarter 2017 G&A expense. The increase was primarily due to legal expenses related to operator workouts and restructurings. For modeling purposes, we project our G&A for the fourth quarter of 2018 to be consistent with or slightly greater than our third quarter G&A as a result of continued legal expenses related to operator workouts and transitions before returning to our traditional $8 million to $9 million of quarterly G&A run rate.\nIn addition, we expect our non-cash stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $4 million per quarter for the fourth quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019, consistent with the first three quarters of 2018.\nInterest expense for the quarter, when excluding non-cash deferred financing costs, was $48 million or roughly the same as the third quarter of 2017 as lower debt balances were offset by a higher blended cost of debt primarily as a result of higher LIBOR rates. In the third quarter, we sold seven assets for consideration of $26 million in net cash proceeds and a $5 million seller note recognizing a loss of approximately $5 million. In the third quarter, we reported approximately $300,000 in revenue related to these seven dispositions.\nDuring the quarter we recorded a $2 million recovery in provision for uncollectible accounts related to $2 million in cash payments received from Orianna that was required as part of the bankruptcy plan and was applied to accounts receivable written off in 2017. We also recorded approximately $23 million in real estate impairment charges to reduce the net book value on eight facilities to their estimated fair values or expected selling prices.\nTurning to the balance sheet. At September 30, we had 10 facilities valued at approximately $18 million classified as assets held for sale, and we're still evaluating approximately $60 million in potential asset disposition opportunities that could occur over the next several quarters. Our balance sheet remained strong for the three months ended September 30th.\nOur net debt to adjusted annualized EBITDA was 5.42 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 4 times. It's important to note, EBITDA in these calculations has only $17 million of annual revenue related to Orianna facilities and no revenue related to construction in process related to new builds. When adjusting for the likely range of expected rental outcome from Orianna, the known revenue on the new builds and removing revenue related to our third quarter asset sales, our pro forma leverage would be roughly 5 times.\nI'll now turn the call over to Dan Booth.\nDaniel Booth -- Chief Operating Officer\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone.\nAs of September 30th, 2018, Omega had an operating asset portfolio of 917 facilities, with approximately 92,000 operating beds. These facilities were spread across 67 third-party operators and located within 40 states and the United Kingdom.\nTrailing 12-month operator EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage for our core portfolio was up slightly during the second (ph) quarter of 2018 at 1.7 and 1.34 times respectively versus 1.69 and 1.33 times respectively for the trailing 12-month period ended March 31, 2018.\nTurning to portfolio matters. In addition to the ongoing Orianna situation, which Taylor spoke about earlier, effective November 1st, Omega transferred nine former preferred care facilities, five in New Mexico and four in Arizona, to an existing Omega operator. Over the next several months, we expect to release two facilities in Oklahoma and sell three additional facilities in New Mexico, which will conclude our preferred care relationship.\nTurning to new investments. On September 28th, 2018, Omega entered into a $131 million secured term loan with an unrelated third party. The loan is secured by a collateral assignment of mortgages covering seven skilled nursing facilities, three independent living facilities and one assisted living facility located in Pennsylvania and Virginia with approximately 1,200 total operating beds.\nThe loan bears an interest rate of 9.35% and matures on February 28th, 2019, subject to a one-time 90-day extension. On or before the maturity, Omega expects to obtain fee simple title to the facilities and add them to an existing master lease with a current Omega operator.\nDuring the third quarter, Omega also completed $44 million in capital expenditures. These transactions in aggregate bring Omega's year-to-date investment total through September 30th to $374 million, inclusive of capital expenditures.\nTurning to Omega's repositioning activities. During the third quarter of 2018, Omega sold seven facilities for approximately $31 million with an additional eight facilities sold so far in the fourth quarter of 2018. This brings the year-to-date dispositions to 79 facilities, inclusive of three mortgage loan payoffs, for total consideration of approximately $357 million. In addition to facility sales, Omega has released 62 facilities year-to-date, which includes 22 facilities transferred from the Orianna portfolio mentioned earlier by Taylor and 11 facilities from the preferred care portfolio. We are currently evaluating approximately 20 additional facilities to sell or release in the coming quarters. As always, Omega continues to review our portfolio and discuss strategic repositioning opportunities with each of our operators.\nI will now turn the call over to Steven.\nSteven Insoft -- Chief Corporate Development Officer\nThanks, Dan, and thanks to everyone on the line for joining today.\nIn conjunction with Maplewood Senior Living, we continue work on our ALF Memory Care High Rise at Second Avenue and 93rd Street in Manhattan. The project is expected to cost approximately $285 million including accrued rent and is scheduled to open in late 2019.\nIncluding the land and CIP of our New York City project, at the end of the third quarter, Omega Senior Housing portfolio totaled $1.5 billion of investments in our balance sheet. Anchored by our growing relationship with Maplewood Senior Living and their best-in-class properties, as well as Healthcare Homes and Gold Care in the UK, our overall senior housing investment now comprises 124 assisted living, independent living and memory care assets in the US and UK.\nOn a stand-alone basis, the core portfolio not only covers its lease obligations at 1.2 times, but also represents one of the largest senior housing portfolios among the publicly listed healthcare REITs. Our ability to successfully continue to grow this important component of our portfolio is highlighted by our 14 Maplewood facilities and the related pipeline is predicated on coupling our tenants' operating capabilities with our commitment to having in-house design and construction expertise.\nThrough this same capability, we invested $43.6 million in the third quarter in new construction and strategic reinvestment. $32.4 million of this investment is predominantly related to 13 active new construction projects, with a total budget of approximately $500 million inclusive of Manhattan. The remaining $11.2 million of this investment was related to our ongoing portfolio CapEx reinvestment program.\nI will now turn the call over to Taylor for some final comments.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Steven.\nWhile labor costs and occupancy rates will continue to pose near-term industry challenges, we remain confident that aging demographics and the new PDPM reimbursement system commencing next year will be very positive for the skilled nursing facility industry in the back half of 2019 and going into 2020.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call up for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Chad Vanacore from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\nChad Vanacore -- Stifel -- Analyst\nGood morning all.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Chad.\nChad Vanacore -- Stifel -- Analyst\nRight. So, I'm going to ask this in an odd way because you're in a good pace to be on the high end of your guidance. So flip that around -- what factors could -- or are being contemplated that might put you on the lower end of your guidance?\nRobert Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Chad. Bob. We have -- as you saw on what makes up the guidance on the one page, we have about $60 million of asset sales. So the timing of the asset sales. Dan just mentioned some have already occurred. For modeling purposes, always put them at the middle of the quarter. So, some of that has already happened sooner than I expected. Also the LIBOR rates -- 20% of our debt's variable based, so depending on what happens with LIBOR rates during the fourth quarter. And we have a number of -- there are a few operators who want a cash basis -- so timing of cash payments -- payments. And the last thing would be our G&A. As I said, we expect it to be right around what our third quarter, but as you know, the restructuring, primarily around Orianna is still -- the bankruptcy still going on. So I can't really predict with a total accuracy what that number is going to be. So (inaudible).\nChad Vanacore -- Stifel -- Analyst\nAll right, that's helpful. And then just -- the one other thing, the $2 million legal fee -- I'm sorry, the $2 million recovery of bad debt, what was that from?\nRobert Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer\nThat was Orianna, which required to pay us $1 million a month. We received $2 million during the quarter. We applied it to outstanding or AR that was written off in 2017.\nChad Vanacore -- Stifel -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. Well, good quarter. And I'll talk to you soon. Thanks.\nRobert Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nTodd Stender -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nHi, thanks. Can you just give more color on the --- the loan you made, the $131 million for the portfolio? It sounds like it won't stick around very long if it converts to own real estate, but just want to hear a little bit more about that. Thanks.\nRobert Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure, you're exactly right. It some -- we expect it to be a short-term loan. It actually has a maturity of six months. So sometime in the first quarter we expect it to flip from a loan to fee simple interest in the properties in Pennsylvania and Virginia. The structure was really a nuance, that your question, it was a combination to the seller, so.\nTodd Stender -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nFor tax purposes, I imagine. For tax reasons, is that a way to make the loan upfront like this?\nRobert Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer\nI can't speak for the seller, to be honest.\nTodd Stender -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nAll right. But that's fair. Okay. Will it even cash flow --- will you collect any loan payments or this is kind of -- it will just immediately roll into a lease and you'll just factor that into the initial lease yield?\nRobert Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo. We're actually -- we're absolutely getting monthly payments of interest based on the known -- 3.75% ph) rate.\nTodd Stender -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you. And then just on dispositions, with the FAD payout ratio getting up around 100%. Do you delay timing on asset sales at all or do you have a sense of urgency to clean up the portfolio? And there may be a gap in cash flow to cover the dividend. How do you think about moving those asset sales quicker or do you hold on to them and spread them out?\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. We're -- from our perspective, Todd, we're going to -- we will be as aggressive as we can in terms of repositioning the portfolio. And as we've mentioned, the vast majority of that (inaudible). We've got a handful of things we'll clean up in Q4 and then we will really be talking about asset repositioning as a program more like forwarded to (ph) 2019 on just be regular sales. But from a timing perspective, we want to clean that up as fast as we can. And we go, on a forward basis, we have lots of -- we still have assets on the sideline that improve that FAD coverage ratio. I noted in my comments that it's at 96%, which is actually a little bit better than Q2, and we think that will continue to improve going into '19.\nTodd Stender -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.\nLukas Hartwich -- Green Street Advisors. -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. On the $130 million loan, are there any additional costs when that converts to fee simple ownership?\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo, there is not. We've -- those documents are done.\nLukas Hartwich -- Green Street Advisors. -- Analyst\nOkay. And then the yield, once those convert, is that going to be in line with the interest rate?\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, exactly.\nLukas Hartwich -- Green Street Advisors. -- Analyst\nGreat. That's it. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. Please go ahead with your question.\nDaniel Bernstein -- Capital One -- Analyst\nHi, guys. Good morning.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nDaniel Bernstein -- Capital One -- Analyst\nSeems to me like you're almost getting really back to business of growing through acquisitions, again, so maybe if we could talk a little bit about the pipeline that's out there. Are you seeing any better opportunities on the SNF side, whether that's lease coverages or yield and maybe the mix between what you're looking to go after in terms of seniors housing versus this?\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So let me start by saying just so that we're clear on pipeline, when Omega talks about pipeline we've really talked about transactions that we feel are going to close. We've got something generally find out -- it's not as many people refer to pipeline, it's just what's come across our desk. At any given time, we're seeing millions if not hundreds of millions if not at times billions of transactions that are coming across our desk. We're seeing -- we feel most of everything that's out there. As far as our pipeline goes, in the -- coming into the fourth quarter or end of the fourth quarter -- once again, it's still not terribly robust. We're seeing a lot of stuff, but we're not trading a lot of stuff. It's really a combination of a bunch of factors. I mean, obviously we've been in a little bit of reposition mode over the course of the last year and a half. We've seen cap rates jump around quite a bit and we've sort of hoped and waited for those to settle in. And then our operators, as you can imagine, have been repositioning themselves, so they're really paying attention to their -- their existing portfolios and getting their house of cards in order. It seems to us as we look out at '19, this is more intuitive than anything that -- people are starting to pay more attention to the deals that are out there, I think, and we do believe that it will be a more acquisitive year in 2019 as some of our operators sort of get back in the game.\nDaniel Bernstein -- Capital One -- Analyst\n(technical difficulty) Coming out of Nick (ph), we also heard that maybe private equity wasn't quite as aggressive in their underwriting for SNFs. Is that something you're seeing? And again, I'm just trying to gauge -- for you and for maybe other -- your peers, whether it's going to be a better investment opportunities set for '19 than it had been in '18, '17 -- the REIT's going to gain an advantage of a private equity? That that's really the question.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I think -- it's Taylor. In terms of yields, Dan, we're starting to see a little bit more stability in the (inaudible) for SNFs, and that may be exactly what you say that private equity is a little bit less aggressive. On the senior housing side, I'm not sure that I can speak to that as definitively although I'd expect it's going to be similar.\nDaniel Bernstein -- Capital One -- Analyst\nOkay. Okay. And then one last question and I'll hop off. In terms of -- I mean, it seems like your lease coverage is starting to stabilize. You did mention right there at the end of the call about some of the -- the wage pressures that are out there. So I was trying to get a little bit better sense from you for what the operators are saying in terms of what you're seeing as headwinds, what you're seeing as opportunities, I guess maybe pre- PDPM for '19. Just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about the stability or risk to the lease coverage in the next 12 months.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think coverages will be relatively stable, but I don't see them improving. I think the headwinds of labor and the ongoing battle around occupancy, which I'll note that our operators have held occupancy fairly stable. But different geographies are different. I mean, Texas has been a particularly tough market in terms of occupancy for our portfolio and others. So I think we're going to see general stability as we continue to battle the headwinds. And we do have the benefit of a decent Medicare increase October 1st, some decent Medicaid rate increases. So -- it's not all, it's not all headwinds even the next 12 months, but certainly I don't expect coverages to come rebounding up into the 1.4s (ph) over the next 12 months. We think post-PDPM and the demographics really taking hold, we'll start to see some positive momentum in '20, for sure.\nDaniel Bernstein -- Capital One -- Analyst\nOkay. Okay. That's all I have. See you guys out there in San Francisco.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\n(inaudible).\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Karin Ford from MUFG Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nKarin Ford -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Wanted to ask a question on Orianna just for modeling purposes more than anything else. Do you have any more visibility on the timing of when you think the final set of properties will be resolved next year? And do you have a bias toward the -- either the low or the high end of the range on your rent projection from Orianna?\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo -- we had talked over the last few quarters, thinking that Orianna would finalize this year, and that's not going to be the case. Bankruptcy is its own beast. And you're right, it's going to be next year. Our view, it's probably Q1 of '19. And then in terms of where we are in the range, we're still looking at the middle of the range as a pretty good estimate. So you got $3 million in either side of that, but I think in terms of modeling, I would take the middle of the range.\nKarin Ford -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And then my second question is just on investments. If the pipeline does play out and you end up being a net buyer next year, can you just talk about how you're viewing your sources of capital today, what do you find most attractive and your thoughts around equity issuance at this level?\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nWe will certainly use equity to the extent that we find opportunities consistent with the past. I mean, we're going to maintain our leverage at 5 or below. Bob had mentioned on pro forma basis, when you put Orianna back to work and put the assets, the biggest being 2nd Avenue, to work, you get into that range. But we will continue to issue equity parallel to our investment activity. The one comment I would make is to the extent that Orianna is resolved and we have cash proceeds come back to us that's obviously a source, which will be our first source in terms of capital deployment.\nKarin Ford -- MUFG Securities -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, at this time I'm showing no additional questions. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nTaylor Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Jamie. And thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning. As always, the management team, in particular, Bob Stephenson and Matthew Gourmand will be available for any questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for attending today's presentation.
