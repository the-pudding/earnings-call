GMV reached RMB3.08 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 58.5% increase. The fourth quarter is a traditional strong season for online consumption, and we also realized strong users and sales growth by maximizing the opportunity to sell during the influential consumer events, such as Double-11 and Secoo's own Luxury Festival, which begins annually on December 17th.

Behind the scene, Secoo extensively utilized Big Data in analyzing consumption habit, preference and demand of our upscale customers. In this way, we are able to optimize the product mix from our existing business while leveraging the advantage of superior external resources to curate a optimal mix of offerings. Also, we have been able to successfully extend our premium offering using a rotation of fresh service and product, which meet our customer's unique taste for both boutique brands and services, which provide our customer with elevated shopping experiences.\nAnother highlight of 2018 Global Luxury Festival was the achievement of integrating our omni-channel strategies in an effort to build on collaborations with strategic partners. This is showcased by a tourism exhibition featuring exclusive tourism offering at a average price about RMB13,000 through integrated online and offline marketing activities in collaboration with Caissa Travel, as well as a variety of mutual sales promotion activities in collaboration with SASSEUR Group.

To further add to this, more and more consumer demand is emerging especially among the millennials, who favor adventurous and interactive experience, high quality goods contributing to the sense that they have made well informed purchases.

According to the agreement, Secoo is the exclusive online co-organizer, will simultaneously exhibit more than 400 art works from 30 famous domestic and foreign galleries for sale.\n(foreign language) I also wanted to address a bit on our business expansion in the first fashion lifestyle offerings. We officially launched the Secoo Sports in 2018, catering to a elite community who engage in the active sports lifestyle. Secoo Sports covers a wide range of businesses, including selling professional sports equipment, providing high end sports services and promoting sought-after sports brands.

It demonstrates our brand strength and footprint in this field, aiming to lead a trend toward boutique lifestyle. Taking a few examples of our effort in the fourth quarter, we continue to tap into the rising popularity of winter sports. In addition to working with major ski equipment brands, setting up a winter sports social community with Secoo's membership brands to offer shopping recommendations and discovery services.\nSecoo also hosted a membership event in partnership with premium golf equipment brand Callaway, extended upscale sports lifestyle into children centered activities such as American Football trials for kids, Golf Family Day and horse riding adventures for teenagers.\n(foreign language) We believe our ability to leverage premium and securities product and services offerings combined with superior B2C data analytics round out our core capacity and position us well to capture the rapid growth and the significant market potential in our industry. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Secoo upgraded its operating infrastructure based on Oracle's Cloud Platform architecture and utilizing Big Data. Secoo's front and back-end systems now have higher inter-operational from a financial reporting and operational standpoint. Operational data and information flow are now consolidated, shared and transferred to the financial system in real time, providing intelligence driven digital platform for faster domestic expansion, as well as serving as the technological backbone of the global platform as a whole.\nWe are confident that digitalization will serve as important booster for Secoo's growth.

In 2018, we served 36 advertisers operation top tier brands in segments such as automotive, luxury goods line, financial services and smart product. Notably, Secoo partnered with Sina Weibo to publish a white paper for luxury spending power, addressing user profile of luxury shoppers on Weibo. This combined shopping data from Secoo's online platform and online social behavior of customers through Weibo accounts including their engagement habits, rich KOL and collaborative referrals.

Additionally, leveraging transaction data on Secoo's platform, we continue to sync up this Tencent user behavior data having several luxury including Roger Vivier, TSF, (inaudible) on the WeChat platform.\n(foreign language)\nWith 2019 as the start of our second package of operation, we will embrace the evolution of our business.

We will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please ask your question.\nKaren Chan -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n(foreign language) I'll go ahead and translate myself. My first question is for within the other revenue, what's the mix between marketplace service and others and can management give us more color on the breakdown of marketplace by category, including direct brand partnership, advertising, travel services, et cetera? What's the commission rate by category and how do we guarantee our product authentication process for online marketplace products?\nSecond question is, given the structural business mix change, how should we think about 2019 GMV and revenue growth, respectively, and is there any implications to outgrow the operating margin expansion target? And lastly, from a big picture perspective, any thoughts you can share with us regarding the change in competitive landscape given the partnership between Alibaba and Net-a-Porter and also JD and Glenfiddich? How do we plan to differentiate against the peers? Thank you very much.\nShaojun Chen -- Chief Financial Officer\n(foreign language) Hello, our CFO, Mr. Shaojun Chen answered the first and second question. So for the first question, Secoo is strategically positioned to build up a boutique lifestyle and service platform. In the year 2018, we continued to reinforce the well developed categories, such as apparel, watch and bags while expanding offerings in new categories that consumers have substantial interest, such as beauty products, the 3C (ph) electronic appliance, (inaudible) to diversify and create a comprehensive structure of trendsetting product (ph) offering.\n(foreign language)\nIn the fourth quarter, especially taking the opportunity during the influential promotional activities such as the Double-11 and Luxury Festival of December '17, we not only achieved the strong sales in dominant categories, but also to some extent promote sales in tourism (inaudible) as such our GMV in the fourth quarter grew by 58.5% on year-over-year basis with market based business generating approximately 30% of the total GMV. Currently, depending on our collaboration with suppliers, we now have three corporation (ph) models, namely marketplace, consignment, and stocking.\n(foreign language) I would like to you a breakdown in terms of categories. (foreign language) So the 3C -- the electronics appliance takes the overall GMV at 4.03%. (foreign language) Beauty takes 2.92%. (foreign language) The footwear and accessories take around 8.6%. (foreign language) The tourism and luxury takes around 7.8%.\n(foreign language) Besides a few interest in the suppliers and products that we engage with for market based models, including first a direct-to-brand cooperation; second, a standardized 3C digital product; third, for the service offering, we choose well-known brand with high-quality services; the fourth is, we have long-term collaboration (inaudible) product and it can guarantee high quality. In the meantime, we require the product or marketplace must complying with our platform's policy of quality. We attach great importance to customers' feedback so as to implement entire process control.\n(foreign language)\nSo, for the first question -- for the second question, so as we remain focused on executing our strategies we expect our GMV will continue to scale up to fastest pace.\n(foreign language)\nThe estimate our GMV for the first quarter of 2019 will grow over 55% on a year-over-year basis. However, the accounting treatment for marketplace business is different from merchandise sales and revenue growth is a slower than the GMV growth. In terms of the gross margin, increasing contribution from the marketplace business is good for us to improve our margins. We estimate the gross margin for the 2019 will be up approximately 200 basis points.\n(foreign language) Our Founder answered the third question. We are pleased there is a tremendous market demand and great potential for long-term development in China's upscale market. Secoo is positioned to provide premium lifestyle products and services to address this market demand and clearly differentiate us this competitive advantages. So there will not be substantial change in the competitive landscape. We will continue our strategy of strengthening brands, channel and crossover collaborations, increase more high-end goods and services, improve our supply chain system around the world, integrating online and offline omni-channel operations and vigorously developing premium membership programs. This is the difference between the us and other competitors.\n(foreign language) So our active user have been rapidly growing with 78% year-over-year increase for the full year of 2018. Our accumulated registered users reached 27 million as of the end of 2018 with ever growing customer loyalty, which is reflected by a 51% retention rate. The excellent performance of our business demonstrates our advantages and potential in the space of high-end consumption and service segments. So we are quite competent.\nKaren Chan -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThank you very much.\nRichard Rixue Li -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you.
