[Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Heather Schmidt, director of investor relations. Thank you.Â You may begin.\nHeather Schmidt -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Nine Energy Service earnings conference call to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2018. With me today are Ann Fox, president and chief executive officer, and Clinton Roeder, chief financial officer. We appreciate your participation.\nSome of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Nine's views about future events. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC.\n\nWe undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are also included in our third quarter press release and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. For today's call, we'll begin with Q3 financial and operational results for the legacy Nine business only.\nMagnum Q3 numbers are still under review by their auditors and nine-month actuals as of September 30, 2018, will be filed on an 8-K by January 9, 2019, which is within 75 days of the acquisition date of October 25 of this year. All of Magnum's financial information from the acquisition date forward will be included in our consolidated results and reported under our completion solutions segment as part of our completion tools service line. Finally, to end the call, we will provide an update on our technology trials, Q4 guidance, and our 2019 outlook. I will now turn the call over to Ann Fox.\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third-quarter results for 2018. We had another strong band differentiated quarter of growth exceeding the midpoint of management's original revenue guidance by approximately 3% and the midpoint of original adjusted EBITDA guidance by approximately 8%.\nAll of our service lines across the completion solutions segment outperformed this quarter, adding approximately 4 percentage points to the adjusted gross profit margin in that segment. Company revenue for the quarter was $218.4 million, an approximate 6% increase over Q2; net income was $13.7 million, an increase of approximately 51%; and adjusted EBITDA was $38.4 million, an increase of approximately 25%. Incremental adjusted EBITDA margins for the company were approximately 60% and incremental adjusted gross profit margins in our completion solutions segment were approximately 90%. Cash flow from operations was $25.6 million, an increase of over 220% quarter over quarter, and we generated a cash flow yield of approximately 6% for Q3.\nROIC for the third quarter was 12%, up 400 basis points over Q2 ROIC of 8%. We are very pleased with our performance this quarter and continue to see activity increases across almost all of our service lines with the strongest increases in completion tools and wireline as well as price increases across all of our service lines with the exception of completion tools with the strongest increases coming from coil tubing and wireline. The outperformance this quarter is due in large part to the incredible team in the field, who continues to execute day in and day out on the well site by providing both the best technology and service to our customers. Throughout the year, we have seen profitable market share gains.\nAt the end of Q3, our U.S. Wireline and Completion Tools business participated in 16% of stages completed in the U.S., an increase of over 160% since 2014, and increased our total stages completed as a company by approximately 9% quarter over quarter. In cementing, we have increased our total jobs by quarter since the end of 2017 by 36% without adding any incremental equipment until the back half of this quarter, while simultaneously increasing our average revenue per job. We continue to hear from operators about their focus on reducing cycle times and increasing efficiencies, and they have begun measuring service providers down to the minute.\nAll of these trends benefit Nine as we solidify partnerships with our customers. We always try to provide a value proposition that is built and sustained on performance. For example, our Scorpion Composite Plugs is reducing cycle times and saving operators more than two days per well. Recently an operator in the Northeast drilled out 144 of our Scorpion plugs with a single drill bit, eliminating the costly process of tripping in and out of the well and replacing the bit.\nWe also provided the wireline work on this well and completed all 144 stages as numerous runs. At Nine, we thrive on working with the most forward-leaning operators and completing the most complex wells across North America. Moving forward, we will remain focused on providing technology and service to push the limits on completion to help our customers reduce cost and increase production. As we have previously discussed, labor has been a bottleneck in the industry, and we saw significant wage inflation in the first half of this year.\nThis quarter, wage inflation was relatively flat contributing to margin expansion quarter over quarter. We anticipate the majority of wage inflation for the company in 2018 was taken during the first half of the year, and I will speak more to 2019 later in the call. During Q3, we increased our headcount by approximately 3% versus 7% in Q2. And since the end of 2017, we have added over 300 incremental employees and increased our headcount by approximately 18%.\nOur average stages per employee per month in Q3 was approximately 14.5 stages, an increase of approximately 164% over 2014. We anticipate this trend continuing as more operators transition to manufacturing mode on their multi-well pads. I am extremely excited to welcome Magnum to Nine. Later in the call, we will also be discussing another team, who we are thrilled to have join us through an acquisition we completed in October.\nAs a reminder, we successfully closed the acquisition of Magnum Oil Tools on October 25, positioning Nine as one of the premier providers of completion-focused technology combined with excellence in both service execution and conveyance capability. We now have a strong first-mover advantage in dissolvable technology and a proven internal R&D team to ensure we are staying ahead of trends. With this transaction, we put a new capital structure in place with long-dated maturities and enhanced financial flexibility, including a private offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.75% senior unsecured notes due in 2023, and we closed its new $200 million, five-year ABL credit facility. I want to reiterate our conservative approach to debt and believe that one-time net debt to EBITDA is the optimal leverage profile.\nWith the company becoming so much more cash generative, we still anticipate a reasonable cap rate to reach our target leverage within the next 12 to 24 months. We were extremely pleased with the continued growth and execution this quarter. I remain confident in the team we have in place and our ability to differentiate. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Clinton to walk through segment and other detailed financial information for the quarter.\nClinton Roeder -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Ann. As a reminder, all financial information and operational metrics are for the legacy Nine business only and do not include any Magnum numbers or metrics. In our completion solutions segment, third-quarter 2018 revenue totaled $196.6 million, an increase of approximately 6% compared to second-quarter revenue of $185.1 million. Third-quarter 2018 adjusted gross profit was $49.4 million, an increase of approximately 26% over Q2 and an incremental adjusted gross profit margin of approximately 90%.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we completed 1,072 cementing jobs, an increase of approximately 3% over the second quarter. The average blended revenue per job increased by approximately 2%. Cementing revenue for the quarter increased by approximately 5%. Towards the back half of Q3, we received one double and one single pump unit and expect to receive delivery of one single-pump and one double-pump spread in Q4.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we completed 10,698 wireline stages, an increase of approximately 6% versus second quarter. The average blended revenue per stage increased approximately 4%. Wireline revenue for the quarter increased by approximately 10%. We received two incremental growth capital wireline units toward the back half of Q3, and we'll not receive any additional units this year.\nFor completion tools, we completed 18,620 stages, an increase of approximately 11% versus the second quarter. Completion tool revenue increased by approximately 8%. During the third quarter, our coiled tubing days were decreased by approximately 6% due to a unit being down for maintenance for 30-plus days this quarter. We continue to see strong demand for our large diameter coil units with the average blended day rate for Q3 increasing by approximately 8%.\nCoiled tubing utilization during the third quarter was 79%. Coiled tubing revenue increased by approximately 2%. We completed the conversion of our 2 3/8th unit at the end of September, which provided no revenue contribution this quarter. We will not be adding any additional new units this year.\nIn our production solutions segment, third-quarter 2018 revenue totaled $21.8 million, an increase of approximately 7% compared to second quarter 2018 revenue of $20.4 million. Adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $3.1 million, compared to second quarter adjusted gross profit of $2.8 million, an increase of approximately 12%. During the third quarter, well services had utilization of 65%, an increase of 5%. Total rig hours for the quarter was 49,665, an increase of approximately 3%.\nAverage revenue per rig hour during the second quarter was $439, an increase of approximately 4%. During the third quarter, the company reported net income of $13.7 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018. Company reported selling, general, and administrative expenses of $21.8 million, compared to $16.1 million for the second quarter. This increase was largely due to transaction expenses and professional and legal costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $15.5 million, compared to $15.1 million in the second quarter. During the third quarter of 2018, the company's effective tax rate was 7.6%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was primarily attributable to changes in pre-tax book income and valuation allowance positions as well as tax liabilities in states where income is expected to exceed available net operating losses. During the third quarter, the company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $25.6 million, compared to $7.9 million in Q2, an increase of approximately 224%.\nThe average DSO for the third quarter was 62 days, compared to 59 days in Q2 and is averaged approximately 59 days for the full year. We estimate DSO increase approximately two days due to a major customer implementing a system change, which has been resolved. Total capital expenditures were $11.5 million, of which approximately 22% was maintenance capex. This compares to total capital expenditures of $11.6 million in Q2.\nWe anticipate full-year capex to be within the original guidance of $53 million to $57 million, with a significant portion being taken during Q4. As of September 30, 2018, Nine's cash and cash-equivalents totaled $86.5 million. With a revolver capacity of $49.5 million, Nine's total liquidity position was $136 million on September 30, 2018. I'll now turn it back to Ann to discuss our technology trials and guidance.\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Clinton. Throughout the year, we have been trialing a number of downhole completion tools sourced through either strategic alliances or developed through internal R&Ds. We have said many times, we do not feel in anyway GAAP with our competition with our current technology portfolio. But as an industry, we need to develop reliable completion tools and methodologies that will continue to allow our customers to extend lateral lengths without compromising production, while reducing overall risk, cycle time and intervention in the wellbore.\nAll three of the tools we will discuss today are designed for this purpose. At Nine, we have been searching for reliable interventionless cemented sleeve application, which was the catalyst for our exclusive distribution agreement for the EON sleeve system. As a reminder, the EON system is an interventionless single-size ball activated pinpoint frac-sleeve system, which Nine has exclusive distribution rights for in the U.S. and Canada.\nDuring the year, the team at Nine ran a number of trials, the majority of which took place in Canada. While some trials were successful, the tool did experience challenges downhole and will need further development before being ready for commercialization. We will continue to work with our strategic partner on the evolution of the EON system. Dissolvable technology will play a significant role in the reduction of cycle time, risk and intervention in the wellbore.\nWe believe that having reliable dissolvable offering is imperative. Today, dissolvables are anywhere from 10% to 15% of the total plugs sold and will grow to 35% to 50% in the next three to five years. While still in the early innings of dissolvable technology, we recognized how important it was to participate in this growing market. This year, we started working on our own internal magnesium dissolvable plugs and experienced first-hand barriers to entry.\nWhen the opportunity to partner with Magnum presented itself, we knew this would allow Nine to capture a growing addressable market in dissolvable technology. Magnum has a proven dissolvable portfolio, including a plastic offering and No. 2 market share in the overall dissolvable market. We believe dissolvable technology will be prolific and necessary and the total addressable market will expand as stages are forecasted to grow and lateral lengths extend.\nMagnum introduced a low-temperature plastic dissolvable plug this year, which is well-suited for the Permian and Northeast, and our internal teams are already working on the next generation of dissolvable technology for the future. Our final technology is the Breakthru Casing Flotation Tool, designed and developed by a Norwegian company called Frac Technology. This team is focused on the development of downhole technology and has introduced a number of patents throughout their 30-year history in the industry. The trials have been extremely successful.\nBecause of this success and what we see as a large and growing addressable market, combined with an incredible team, Nine acquired Frac Technology and all related IT and patents in October. The team will remain in Norway, but operationally will fall under Clair Holley, our chief technology officer, and will work in conjunction with Nine and Magnum's R&D teams to continue to work on tool development. The Breakthru Tool provides a durable and cost-efficient method for floating casing to bottom and long lateral wells. To date, we have run over 70 trials with no failures in the Northeast, Permian, Eagle Ford, DJ and MidCon with the first runs in Canada scheduled for Q4 of this year.\nThis system is unique and that it allows operators to reach total depth by eliminating components added to the casing strength commonly used with conventional techniques. The highly engineered plug in the device uses the material barrier to shatter at a precise differential pressure and eliminates the need for debris traps and significantly shortens the shoe trap. The two will not only help to ensure casing will reach bottom efficiently and reliably, but by eliminating the debris trap, the operator saves money and can access more of the lateral potentially increasing EUR. We see substantial growth for the tool in the U.S., Canada and abroad.\nThe tools are sold per well and are most applicable for longer laterals. We feel confident that we will be able to not only take market share from similar products in the market, but also propel adoption with those operators not currently using a flotation device. The reliability and assurance the tool provides far exceed the upfront cost. While we are excited about the potential of the Breakthru Tool, as always, we are focused on the tools of the future.\nThe Frac Technology team has deep expertise in completion and are currently working on the next generation of tools throughout the wellbore. We are extremely excited about what we will be able to do for our customers by combining the Nine, Magnum,Â and Frac Technology R&D teams with the knowledge, intel and execution abilities of our service teams in field. Lastly, I would like to talk about Q4 and what we see for 2019. Please note Q4 guidance is consolidated for Nine and Magnum and includes the legacy Nine business and only two months and six days of Magnum contribution, reflecting the close of the transaction on October 25.\nFor Q4, we expect total revenue between $225 million and $235 million and consolidated adjusted EBITDA between $40 million and $45 million. I want to emphasize that Q4 is not as accurate proxy for the run rate for OFS. And every year, we see slowdowns related to weather, holidays and budget exhaustion. While operators are being more cautious about being within budgets this year, we remain very positive on the overall fundamentals for the industry and outlook for 2019 and 2020.\nWe have been working with our customers to reduce the cost per lateral foot. They are doing more with less, allocating capital toward more large-scale developments with mega well pads and longer laterals with a more balanced consistent approach to 2019. Customer completion efficiencies translate to both OPEX and capital efficiencies within Nine as well as the ability to differentiate and gain market share and price. Operators are seeking the best service providers to ensure production timing, cost predictability and safety at the well site.\nThose are the type of customers we work for today and will continue to focus on in the future. We are currently working with our customers on our 2019 plans with most indicating increases in both activity and production. While we will not provide formal 2019 guidance on this call, we have already ordered a portion of our 2019 growth capital equipment within our completion solutions service line because demand for our work is there. Because of these conversations, we expect another year of growth for Nine in 2019.\nWe will continue to monitor labor and are anticipating another year of wage inflation. Similar to 2018, our 2019 capital plan will prioritize returns, while maintaining our brand and service execution. With the addition of Magnum Oil Tools, Frac Technology and the operational and capital efficiencies, we continue to gain through multi-well pad development, Nine as less capital and labor intensive and much more cash generative with higher barriers to entry. Because of this, in 2019, we see a pathway to margin expansion, increase free cash flow generation as well as a positive trajectory in our ROIC as we can invest less, while increasing profitability.\nOur ultimate goal is to build a sustainable oilfield service platform, better able to service our customers, while mitigating financial risk and increasing return for our shareholders. Today, we believe we have the right blend of service and technology with the best team focused on being good stewards of capital for our shareholders. We will now open up the call to Q&A.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nNine Energy Service, Inc. (NINE) Q1 2019 Earnings Call Transcript\n\n\nNine Energy Service, Inc.

[Operator instructions] Our first question is from James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Wicklund -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys, and congratulations on another quarterly beat. It's appreciated.\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Jim.\nClinton Roeder -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nJim Wicklund -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nAnn, you're obviously positive on dissolvables. Dissolvable technologies were first introduced about four or five years ago into the market. They were first done as just dissolving balls, now we're up to completely dissolving plugs. The chemistry's changed.\nSome people have complained that it's great for farther out, it's not for closer in on the laterals. And after four or five years, we're only at 10% to 15% of the market. Can you tell us where you expect to be in a couple of years and why you expect an acceleration in the adoption of dissolvables?\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Sure. I think it's a great question, Jim. So I think one thing to keep in mind is we think the majority of the traction of 10% to 15% has been gained in the past 18 months.\nSo when we entered the decline beginning in 2015 and then obviously much worse through '15 and '16, that two years really saw, one, a lot of completion engineer is getting fired across North America, a great level of unwillingness to sign any upfront AFE that was increased relative to what composite plug could be. So I think that really [indiscernible] the adoption rate. We also had a large job that occurred in Canada early in 2015 with early dissolvable technology, not Magnum technology, that was a real disaster and that shook a lot of completion engineers. So I think, we've seen a huge proliferation of dissolvables again.\nBeginning in 2017, as the market backdrop became healthier, we also have seen radical shifts in multi-well pad movement and lateral length in the Permian from 2014. It was very rare for us to get up on a two-well pad in 2014. So that concentration of risk on the multiwell pad and the extension of the lateral length has really deferred growth in dissolvable technology, again '17 into this year. We have not seen a tool climb so quickly across the field that we have with dissolvables over the past six months.\nAnd I would sayÂ we've also seen a lot of operators playing around with full wellbore dissolvables. So I'm not sure if that answers your question. I'm happy to go into more detail, but count out two years there in that four years that you were talking about.\nJim Wicklund -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nNo, that's very helpful. I appreciated it. It makes a huge amount of sense and every technology has gotten better over time. My follow-up, if I could, you just demonstrated with the acquisition of Magnum, your willingness to step out and grow in an area where you don't currently play.\nWhere is another area that you don't currently play that you wouldn't mind stepping out to?\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think, we've said many times, there is a lot of geography and terrain for us to concur here in North America, a lot of 2019 will be marked by disciplined organic growth for the company. We have now a very established management team within these service lines. We've got a lot of work to do to really leverage the tools and technology in Magnum and Frac Technology. So we'll be combining both of those and growing across North America, but I would say that 2019 will be very marked by disciplined organic growth.\nAnd at this time, we don't feel a gap in service line and/or technology. We're, obviously, always looking for nice strategic alliances in technology as well as any bolt-on acquisitions that may make sense, but there's not some service line hanging out there that we're keen to get into that we don't have exposure to right now.\nJim Wicklund -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nSo we should expect that beefed-up exposure in places like the MidCon and the Rockies from an organic basis as opposed to adding new product lines?\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I mean, we never want to say never, Jim. But again, we find it hard to justify the premium when we're sitting here with such a talented team. So we've often always said publicly that we're underexposed in the Midcontinent and the Rockies area and, obviously, we'll be focused on those areas.\nJim Wicklund -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nPerfect. Thank you very much. Good job, guys. Appreciate it.\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Jim.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nMarshall Adkins -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGood morning, Ann. You guys seem to have -- I want it pretty fast, but seemed to in almost every subsegment be posting higher revenue per unit or per stage or whatever. That implies you're getting pricing improvement or is that a mix issue or technology adoption? What I'm really asking is, talk about pricing because it seems like you're an outlier in terms of your ability to realize price like across the board in almost every one of your segments last quarter. And if indeed that's the case, how does that look going into '19?\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Well, yes, we did. The only service line where we didn't show an increase in price was completion tools and not just relative to the mix. You're going to see that fluctuate on a quarterly basis.\nSome of our tools, obviously, carry different prices than others. But you are absolutely correct, every other service line, including production solutions, increased price quarter over quarter as well as activity gains. So we're very proud of that. I think we've said many times that combining the technology with the service execution is paramount.\nThe tolerance for the operators that we're working with for mistakes and misruns is just -- I don't want to say it's zero defect, but it's pretty darn close to that. And our team out in the field is just continuing to execute every single day and so we've seen our CP improved significantly. We've seen our operational efficiencies continue to improve significantly. Sometimes that's facilitated by throwing centers all of our equipment, sometimes it's facilitated by good industrial profits that we're infusing in Nine.\nBut mostly it's the differentiation at a supervisor level up through the district manager level, of which we have over a five-, seven-year tenure. We really do feel we've got the most exceptional folks out there. We think they're very motivated, well-incented and certainly extremely differentiated. So we are able to continue to provide that service execution for our customer partners.\nI would also say that we select into customers that have learning cultures and have a relentless focus on reducing the cost to complete. If we were mismatched or misaligned, then you wouldn't see that, but those incremental price increases for our customers are just pale in comparison to them being able to reduce their costs per lateral foot and reliably predict when they're going to bring that well online as well as predict their cost to complete going forward. I think, when you think about 2019, it'll be very, very activity-driven. As we've said many times this year, we drift pricing based on value proposition.\nSo every time we put a tool downhole, that creates time efficiency. Every time we execute and we're creating service execution efficiency, we're providing a value proposition and that's when we'll say here's the economics, here's what your savings are, here's that casing floating tool, and here's your incremental 20 feet of lateral you get per well. So we're always talking in terms of value proposition with price, but I would definitely say '19 will be driven by activity.\nMarshall Adkins -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nPerfect. That's helpful and differentiated. Second question, I know you've had it in-house for whopping two or maybe even three weeks here. Now that you have Magnum on board, any surprises, anything,Â as you've gotten to know theÂ people that you didn't think before? Or insights that may be useful for us to understand how this will fit going forward?\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I mean, I think the big surprise is we knew the team is excellent and we knew that through diligence. But obviously, we weren't able to contact with the broader team. And I think what's been very surprising is how these two teams have jelled so quickly.\nThey have connected on, what I'll call, just a self-starter basis. It's not like, I've had to throw down some [Inaudible] of an integration plan to get people to pick up the phone and talk to each other. So the integration already in the first few weeks has been a lot more seamless than even I would have anticipated. And so I think, that has been very surprising to us with joint customer calls already, and we're obviously in the very heavy planning phase with the engineering teams to figure out how to attack this North American land market in the most successful and efficient way next year, but it's just, to be honest, the team is even better than had expected.\nMarshall Adkins -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGood to hear. Thank y'all.\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our next question is from John Daniel with Simmons & Co. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Daniel -- Simmons & Company -- Analyst\nYes. Thanks a lot. Ann, Q4 guidance, is it possible to get a breakdown between the Magnum contribution and the legacy nonbusiness?\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, John. No, we're not breaking that down. We'll be reporting Magnum under completion tools. And so we will be breaking down that consolidated top line as it relates to the percentages driven from, for instance, cementing, wireline, completion tools, etc.\nBut we will not be breaking out those two lines anymore going forward. One team, one site here.\nJohn Daniel -- Simmons & Company -- Analyst\nOK. Fine. 2019 CAPEX, you mentioned disciplined organic growth. So just on that point, have you placed any orders for new equipment to be delivered next year? And if so, can you walk us through what some of those orders might include?\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAt this time, we're not walking you through what those orders are, but we absolutely did put equipment on order. There's still very real supply chain bottlenecks, as you know, in the industry. So we were very keen to get that on order. And I would say, obviously, the service lines that were within and the ones that were not anticipating supplying a lot of growth capital to, I would say, the one service line that won't be receiving a lot of growth capital is production.\nBut every service line within our completion solutions business is going to get attention from the senior management team relative to their margin contribution and the demand and call in their work. So lot more market out there for us to grab for sure. So again, we'll be more detailed on that plan as time goes on, John, but it's safe to say that, yes, we have put a chunk of equipment on order.\nJohn Daniel -- Simmons & Company -- Analyst\nOK. Fair enough. And then one final sort of closing question. You're making great progress on transitioning Nine to a higher tech, less labor-intensive business.\nBut one business as you know that doesn't really fit that mold is well servicing. I'm just curious how do you look at that business going forward?\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I've said this year that I am relatively new to the well service business, and so I'm taking my time to get to know that business. We have often and openly stated that does not have the differentiation of completion solutions. And so we're still evaluating it. We've got some tools out there that we may be able to cross-pollinate into that service line, but I would say, we're obviously always evaluating that industry -- or that segment of our business.\nJohn Daniel -- Simmons & Company -- Analyst\nAnd then I'm just going to squeeze one more in on that segment. Some of the larger peers have talked about efforts to continue pushing pricing. Are you seeing to do that?\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think we've all been pushing pricing together, and we increased our pricing in that service line 4% quarter over quarter. So we're all working on pushing that pricing and it needs to be pushed. As you know, we're in an inflationary environment on wages. And so that's critically important that we keep doing that.\nThink a lot of our serve -- a lot of our customers have also acknowledged that they will have service inflation next year. And as you said, it's a very labor-intensive business.\nJohn Daniel -- Simmons & Company -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you very much.\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John.\nOperator\nWe have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments.\nAnn Fox -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you all for your participation in the call today.
