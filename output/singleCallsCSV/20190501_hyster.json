My name is Christine and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Hyster-Yale Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nChristina Kmetko, you may begin your conference.\nChristina Kmetko -- Investor Relations Consultant\nThank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our 2019 first quarter earnings call. I am Christina Kmetko and I am responsible for Investor Relations at Hyster-Yale. Joining me on today's call are Al Rankin, Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer of Hyster-Yale Materials Handling; Colin Wilson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hyster-Yale Group; and Ken Schilling our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday evening, we published our first quarter 2019 results and filed our 10-Q. Copies of the earnings release and 10-Q are available on our website. For anyone who is not able to listen to today's entire call an archived version of this webcast will be on our website later this afternoon and available for approximately 12 months. I would also like to remind participants of this conference call may contain certain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements made here today in either our prepared remarks or during the following question-and-answer session.\nWe disclaim any obligation to update these forward looking statements which may not be updated until our next quarterly conference call if at all. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties, was set forth in our earnings release and in our 10-Q. Also certain amounts discussed during this call are considered non-GAAP. The non-GAAP reconciliations of these amounts are included in our earnings release and available on our website.\nBefore we talk about the quarter results, let me quickly discuss a change we made to our segment as of the first of this year. If you recall, in late 2018, we announced that Bolzoni's North America attachment manufacturing would be moved out of its location in Illinois into the lift truck businesses in Alabama manufacturing facility. As part of a plan to expand Bolzoni's capabilities in the United States. Effective January 1st, 2019, the Sulligent facility became a Bolzoni facility, and as a result the 2019 financial information and comparative 2018 financial information have been reclassified to reflect the Sulligent facility financial results within our Bolzoni segment.\nOur earnings release provides to revise 2019 and 2018 first quarter information only. However the historical financial data schedules that we filed last night as an 8-K and put on our website provide the revised 2018 information for all quarters and the 2018 full year.\nNow let me discuss our first quarter results activities. I will discuss the highlights first and then get into the detail. On a consolidated basis, our revenues increased almost 6% to $834.8 million up from $788.5 million in last year's first quarter. Each of our three businesses contributed to this increase. The lift truck revenues included $16.4 million of revenues from shipments of 1,300 units at our Hyster-Yale Maximal subsidiary which was acquired in June 2018 and therefore did not have any comparable revenues in the prior year first quarter.\nDespite this revenue growth, we reported a decrease in both our consolidated operating profit and net income to $3.4 million or $0.20 per share compared with operating profit of $19.2 million and net income of $14.9 million or $0.90 per share in the first quarter of 2018. Our core lift truck business, Hyster-Yale Group's first quarter consolidated revenue increased with revenues of $788 million up from $743.3 million last year. The revenue increase was generated primarily from the favorable effect of price increases implemented to offset last year's significant material cost inflation and non-comparable revenues from Hyster-Yale Maximal.\nHowever this segment primarily the Americas and JAPIC divisions also drove the decrease in our consolidated operating profit and net income. Hyster-Yale Group operating profit decreased to $10.8 million in the first quarter down from $26.6 million last year. There are a number of factors contributing to this decline. In the first quarter, the global lift truck market softened particularly in the Americas. I would talk more about that later. The 2019 first quarter unit backlog decreased from the 2018 fourth quarter mainly because of a 2,900 unit decline in the Americas as the rate of bookings in North America decreased due to the softer market. That said, the average sales price per unit in backlog actually increased over both the prior year first and fourth quarters because of the mix of product within backlog.\nConsolidated unit shipments excluding non-comparable Hyster-Yale Maximal shipments decreased from both the prior year first and fourth quarter mainly because of a decline in North America. Overall shipments of lower priced, lower margin units increased during the first quarter or shipments of higher priced units including big trucks were primarily because of ongoing although abating supplier part shortages. These supplier part shortages also caused inefficiencies that created higher manufacturing costs and reduced profits.\nFinally also contributing to the decrease in operating profit were higher operating expenses, unfavorable currency movements of $3.7 million and operating losses of $2 million at Hyster-Yale Maximal. Price increases, net material cost and freight inflation including import tariffs and higher parts volume and margins partly offset the decrease in operating profit.\nMoving to our Bolzoni segment. Bolzoni reported net income of $300,000 and revenues of $91.8 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared with net income of $1.9 million and revenues of $89.5 million in last year's first quarter. As mentioned earlier these revenues have been restated to include the sales of traditional products out of Sulligent. Bolzoni's operating profit decreased to $1.2 million down from $2.7 million last year. The decrease in Bolzoni's operating profit was primarily due to $1.4 million of costs for severance, plant rearrangement and moving expenses related to the transfer of Bolzoni's North America attachment manufacturing from Homewood, Illinois to Sulligent, Alabama which commenced in the first quarter. The impact of US tariffs on imported Chinese components also had an unfavorable effect on Bolzoni's results.\nFinally, in our Nuvera segment, Nuvera reported revenues of $4.5 million in the first quarter compared with $600,000 in the prior year. Revenues increased because of development funding received associated with Nuvera's third party development agreements and increased recognized sales of fuel cell battery box replacements which we refer to as BBRs. Nuvera's first quarter operating loss decreased $8.4 million from $10 million last year. The reduction was mainly because of the product development funding received from third party.\nLooking forward, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives and the many projects we are undertaking to execute these initiatives which we believe will help us obtaining much higher level of competitiveness, market position and economic performance over the next three to five years. Our longer term outlook did not change from what we said at year end. But I have a few updates to our thoughts on 2019. In total the projects, we discussed last quarter have required and continue to require, significant upfront expense and capital expenditure investments.\nWe expect further increased investments to continue to be made in the remainder of 2019 and then generally remain at the 2019 level for the next several years. But we believe the return from these investments has started to be realized and is expected to increase over the next five years. Before I provide an update on our full year outlook, let me provide some updates on specific, more immediate projects and how those are expected to affect 2019.\nWe launched a new end rider and a new automated Reach Truck for the North America market in the first quarter of 2019 and new lower-cost Class 3 walkie and stacker global products are expected to be introduced later in the year. Consolidation of our China production activities into the Hyster-Yale Maximal facility will be ongoing and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.\nAs I already mentioned in the first quarter, Bolzoni began to phase up production at its current Homewood, Illinois facility and we expect to shift the manufacturing to Sulligent to be mostly completed by the end of the 2019 second quarter. Bolzoni recorded a restructuring charge associated with these plans as of March 31st. Payments related to this plan -- this restructuring plan are expected to be made throughout 2019.\nIn addition to the restructuring charge, we are anticipating that Bolzoni will incur subsequent charges during the remainder of the year of approximately $1.5 million to $3 million for additional costs related to restructuring. Finally the transfer the responsibility for the development of non-fuel-cell engine components and the overall assembly of BBRs to Hyster-Yale Group is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.\nTurning now to the overall outlook. In summary while the second quarter is expected to reflect continued investment in all of our program similar to what you saw in our first quarter results, the second half of the year is expected to be significantly improved in comparison to the second half of 2018. Efforts we have taken to abate the most critical supplier issues, which include working with existing suppliers and in some cases finding additional suppliers are succeeding, and improvement has been made in many areas since the end of last year. But there are still some issues that are not expected to be resolved until midyear.\nIn addition, plans established in 2018 to find offsets for the tariff-driven unprecedented material cost in place and witnessed last year will mature during 2019. To augment the plans we have put in place. On April 18th, the US trade representative posted a notice announcing its determination to grant additional exclusion requests for certain duties on Chinese goods. The exclusions will apply retroactively to the July 6, 2018 effective date and will extend for one year after the notice of exclusions, or April of 2020. Certain components of fork lift trucks, including counterweights and forks were listed in the notice as exclusions for the duties, while other components that we and our suppliers import from China are still subjected to certain tariffs. We are currently in the process of determining duties recoverable from the government and suppliers.\nIn addition, our current lift truck backlog contains certain deal-specific pricing agreements at less than target margins to gain targeted accounts and for which margin improvement efforts will take some time to mature. We expect these agreements to reduce profitability in the second quarter and to a lesser degree in the third\nquarter of this year. However margins are expected to recover fully from the 2018 material cost inflation and the heavily discounted deals by late third quarter or the fourth quarter of 2019. Margins will also be enhanced over the remainder of this year by the exemption of tariffs on certain Chinese components.\nIn this context we expect 2019 operating profit of Hyster-Yale Group to improve over 2018. But was also in the first half of the year expected to be lower than the first half of last year and then improve in the second half. Beginning in 2020, further improved results are expected with significant continuing increases through 2023. Bolzoni's results are expected to improve in 2019 and in the following years with the target of 7% operating profit margin being reached in the shorter term. Nuvera's results are expected to improve moderately over the course of 2019 with Nuvera's objective being to reduce its loss significantly in the fourth quarter of this year and to reach breakeven in 2020.\nAt each of these three businesses, we expect that the investments being undertaken will lead to increased operating profit through higher volume, decreased product costs and improved pricing partially offset by a higher level of operating expense.\nAs a result, broadly expect 2019 consolidated operating profit to increase significantly over 2018 with the improvement coming in the second half of the year. Of course the absolute level of profitability will reflect actual market demand levels which showed substantial softening particularly in the Americas in the first quarter. While markets are still at historically high levels we are uncertain about whether this market decline is the beginning of a downturn or a reduction from abnormal prior year first quarter market growth resulting from customers placing orders early in anticipation of increasing prices for material cost inflation and new tariffs.\nTherefore in 2019, we are currently forecasting strong but moderating lift truck market levels with the US market expected to be down by single digits for the 2019 full year, and we expect a resolution to Brexit in a way that does not significantly harm our business prospects.\nBefore I call -- open up the call for your questions, I wanted to make a comment about our cash position. Our cash position at March 31st was $55.7 million compared with $83.7 million at the end of 2018. Our debt balance was $309.4 million up modestly from $301.5 million at December 31st.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks, I will now open up the call for your questions.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nHyster-Yale Materials Handling Inc (HY) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript\n\n\nThis Troubling Trend Held Back Hyster-Yale\n\n\nHyster-Yale Puts 2017 in the Record Books\n\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joe Mondello from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.\nChristina Kmetko -- Investor Relations Consultant\nJoe?\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nYeah, can you hear me?\nChristina Kmetko -- Investor Relations Consultant\nYeah, we can.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. Sorry about that. Good morning, everyone.\nChristina Kmetko -- Investor Relations Consultant\nGood morning.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nFirst question I just wanted to tackle sort of that geographic end markets, I know in the press release as well as I think in your prepared commentary you talked about how the Americas seemed to be slowing a little bit but could we just sort of go over what you're seeing among the major end markets and how your things are trending.\nKenneth C. Schilling -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAl, you want to address that?\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. The -- I mean as we said in the release the Americas market was down, North America was down over 20% in the first quarter compared to the apply. But again the prior was unusually high because of all of the price increases and buying forward and what have you. Latin America really the same factor, that was down sort of mid teens. Brazil, that market is recovering very nicely. It was up almost 20% in the first quarter. You go across to Europe the northern part of Europe which includes the UK surprisingly doing very well it's up above 5% on prior year.\nMost of the other regions in Europe, itself it sort of down a little bit, 3%, 4% the big market that was down over there was Middle East Africa. Big driver there was Turkey that market basically has collapsed showing a little bit of sign of a recovery but significantly down on where it's been. And then in the JAPIC region, China was very strong, I mean it was up double-digits, 11%, 12%. Asia Pacific markets were down around about the 10% mark. And you know as a region the entire region was up 6%, 7%. So just one other comment, Joe about the US market, you know, coal activity is very high, rental activity is high. You know there is no sort of sales teams really don't have any sort of negative sentiment. So, you know as we sort of look forward, we're sort of almost keeping to our original plan assumptions for the balance of the year, except that, the first quarter is in the books and so, that's influencing our full year outlook.\nKenneth C. Schilling -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThe only thing I'd add to that is that in some sense we had become concern over the course of last year certainly to some degree the year before that the markets around the world were increasing at a rate that was too rapid to be sustainable. From our vantage point we'd rather see more moderate growth on a regular basis in our markets and so some pullback from those very high levels in my view is probably desirable. Of course, the question is, the one we posed in the release and Christy mentioned at the end of her comments which is, our working assumption at the moment is kind of a pullback, we don't see indications that it's heading toward a significant major downturn, but that's something we'll watch very, very closely. But the levels that we're at now are by historical standards pretty significant market levels and probably more sustainable than the ones we had last year and the year before.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay, just one follow up on this topic, for North America just wondering how did the orders trend throughout, January to April. Did they get worse or did they, you know, finish a little better. How did the orders trend throughout that time period and where was the weakness in terms of class of trucks?\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWeakness in terms of class of trucks, the first quarter was very, very weak in class 2. But again, I think that's because a lot of trucks got purchased last year as our class 2 was down on the quarter compared to the same period last year by over 35%, you know, the class 4 and 5 markets are down about 20%. Class 1 market down in about 15%. So again if you, some -- that's included, I mean with some just very, very large orders placed in the first quarter. So the comparable is that you can be a little bit of the first quarter of last year, you know the comparables can be a little bit misleading as to what's actually happening in the market. As far as it trending we saw stuff to early on I mean as we look at where we are now our bookings have been increasing as we've gone out of the first quarter into the second quarter.\nKenneth C. Schilling -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd remember that class 2 is not an area of real market strength for us.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay, great. That's great color. Thank you. And then I wanted to touch on sort of price cost and supplier constraints. First on price costs where what quarter did you sort of see the worst of the net effects of that headwind and I assume you going forward you see sort of an improvement on a quarter to quarter basis throughout this year.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah I think we were calling out the third quarter of last year really our most difficult quarter, because we still had steel and aluminum pricing issues that we had not yet pricing to offset the increase to material costs driven by the first round of tariffs, and then of course we had the imposition of the Chinese component tariffs. Since that point in time of course the price increases we've put in place have begun to phase in and begin to balance those out.\nKenneth C. Schilling -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI think on the big deal -- the deal as we took it aggressive pricing, I think right in the middle of it now, I think it'll be there for the second quarter, and then as Chris you said that will ease up in the third quarter. So you have the two factors playing together. One is the price/cost recovery from the inflation of the tariffs and then it's the (inaudible) going through the (inaudible) on the big deals. So that's why we're calling out third quarter as a sort of a halfway back and then fourth quarter which to be right on track.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, and I think another part of the answer is that in the first quarter actually there was an improvement overall in the relationship of priced in and cost. So we are starting to get ahead of the game in the first quarter itself. And that continues in the quarter throughout the year with the largest impact coming out with very significant impact in the fourth quarter.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. So by 4Q you know considering where commodity prices are and where you're forecasting commodity costs all your cost side, you anticipate sort of back to neutral or back to normal by 4Q on a price cost basis.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think that the second half we've called out is a better half than the first half. And all of those trends come together. And don't forget we haven't calibrated at this point the impact of the duty regulation, exemption and you know just as we were hurt in the -- when those duties were imposed because our backlog didn't impact prices that took those duties into account. One says those are relieved. We certainly expect to net maintain some benefit on the way up just as we got hurt on the way down. So there's a factor in the year that didn't calibrated that is worth keeping in mind as a part of all of this process.\nLittle bit of relief on the PPE on the purchasing side. I mean we're seeing a little bit less inflation coming through, rather than we originally expecting in the plan. So it's actually running the -- material costs are actually running little better than we had been anticipating already.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay, good to know. Looking at --\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nBut that number that's significantly better as the year goes along.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nRight, right. Looking at the backlog and this just sort of goes back to sort of the questionings on how the 1Q orders have trended. The -- you mentioned, the bookings and dollar per unit has improved. I assume that's suggesting that your bigger trucks are -- you're receiving more orders or at a faster rate than some of your smaller trucks at least in the booking side of things. And I'm wondering why it seems a little surprising to me, because you have -- you know Europe is not doing so great. North America seems to have -- has slowed a little bit in 1Q from 4Q and I'm just wondering what you're sort of seeing and why you think you know the demand for those heavy, high priced trucks.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nLet's distinguish between the heavy -- heavier and lighter. It's not really heavy trucks that we're necessarily talking about here. Remember that our strength worldwide does not lie in the warehouse side of the business which is Class 2 and 3 and those are the lower priced trucks. So to the extent that the market is flowing particularly in those areas, our backlog tends to get richer because we're strong and counterbalance trucks so it's not just big trucks it's generally Class 4 and 5 and also plants 1 where we have very -- a better market position and those trucks are holding up somewhat better.\nI think another factor Joe is that we -- last year and beginning of this year we had a lot of supplier issues at our plant in Nijmegen. And so the ability to ship trucks was was impeded. Those issues are basically behind us. But you know it takes a while to get those trucks over and then shipped an invoice. So some of the reason for the size of the backlog is that you know we've had the orders and we haven't been able to satisfy them and those a lot of those units will actually be shipped in the second quarter of the undone the third quarter as we get. Again we're back on date in terms of supplying to customers expectations. We haven't been there for some time. I think the demand for big trucks in the US. That was very very strong last year, and we're expecting it to sort of continue at a strong level. You know maybe a little bit of last year's pace but last year's pace was a record by some margin in terms of how many big trucks are sold.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. I also wanted to ask on your sort of the cost/investment side of things and I know over the last couple of years you've been certainly investing in the long term and it seems like 2019 and this is not a huge surprise this quarter. You talked about it last quarter that investment and costs are going to rise in 2019 again. Is there any way I don't know quantify or help us understand to what degree those costs are rising? Are they're going to rise sequentially from where they were in the first quarter. Anything that you can do to sort of help us how to think about that?\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I think the best data we have out there Joe is in our capital expense disclosure in the queue that was issued. We don't break out the remainder of 2019 by quarter, but you will see the number and you will see that we have $76.5 million of expected CapEx and we break it down by lift truck, Bolzoni and Nuvera, so you can see that detail as well. And then...\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. And what...\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThere are SG&A expenses associated with accomplishing what those capital expenditures are for, and that whole process is continuing to go on. And I think what we said is we expect additional costs in 2019 and then we expect them to stabilize in 2020. So I think that's really the best way to do think about it -- is that we're putting in place broadly all the capabilities and that we need to have out there.\nSo that is the start of the one time set of programs if you will or the level of them any way that is associated with the new products that we're going to be introducing particularly beginning in 2020. And that's the major program and that's what most of the capital expenditures are associated with and there's a great deal of expense associated with the -- with those programs right at this point.\nThen secondly we've also called out the fact that we've strengthened our phone coverage capabilities to supplement our dealer's coverage capabilities on certain kinds of accounts and reinforce that with industry strategies and a particular focus on how our products and particularly including the new products that we have coming out can be tailored to meet the needs of those customers. And so that process could be pretty much completed this year and in 2020 we'll be running at that level.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOk. So then your CapEx is assuming that there's a pretty significant increase in CapEx for the remainder of the year. Is it fair to assume that SG&A will ramp up sequentially as CapEx does as well.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, we've been putting this in place over the course of the last couple of years. So, it'll probably begin to moderate in the second half of the year. We do have some product development activity increasing in the course of 2020 that's associated with the product development, because those products are being launched in -- in the course of 2020 and 2021. So there'll be some Increases there, but the SG&A will be pretty much, the regular sales and marketing costs will be pretty much this year.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. And then I have a couple of questions on Nuvera, wondering when does BBR revenue fully move over to Hyster-Yale Group and then also in terms of the backlog at Nuvera that you have right now with those third party, those two third party agreements. Could you help us understand sort of the cadence and how that backlog flows over the next two or three years. Not necessarily looking for any quantified numbers, but you know without any other orders beyond that I'm just wondering you know what the timing of this is and over what period?\nKenneth C. Schilling -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell I think that you know there's so many factors that are at work at Nuvera that sort of separating out any one is, makes it more complicated rather than last to understand the situation in terms of the financial outcome. I think what we said was that we're going to be, what Christy outlined in her remarks was that for the next couple of quarters we're going to continue to see significant investments, but we were a little bit lower in the first quarter than we were in the first quarter of 2018. And then in the fourth quarter we, you know on it -- it's hard to pinpoint exactly what's going to happen say in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter of next year, because there are a lot of moving parts here, but we see as significantly improved profitability in our reduced losses in the fourth quarter. And then as we've indicated, our objective is to have a breakeven year in the course of 2020.\nAnd I think those are the key factors that you should keep in mind because they involve our point of view with regard to the product development agreements that we're doing to different kinds of sales to different types of customers including both the BBR customers, but also other customers for heavier duty type applications. They include significant cost reduction. They include a significant improvements in the warranty, the expense associated with our products is as we fully commercialise them. So there are a whole series of things that are coming together and over the course of this year and particularly in the fourth quarter and in 2020 and that's the way I'd really think about it.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. And what is the risk I guess one of the reasons why I'm asking about the timing of the backlog. I'm just wondering what the risk is of us seeing this big couple of orders are you know a couple of agreements that you have...\nKenneth C. Schilling -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nLet's talk about -- you're talking about a big couple of orders. We need to be clear with you about that. We don't have a couple of big orders. Those are contracts for development of products and then subsequent sale of products. So they're not exactly dependent on sales in the time periods that we're talking about here. They are actually developing products that will be sold into different markets and we're being paid for that work, because the purchasers believe that the technology that we have in Nuvera is the superior technology, one that is particularly suited to the types of applications that those customers have. And so I don't think that, thinking of them as big contracts are is the right way to do it. Their development contracts with follow on production.\nOn the other hand, the BBR business, we do expect to contribute and we see the opportunity in the sales efforts that we're making to have that sort of numbers of trucks booked and sold that will accomplish the objectives that I just outlined.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Joe, it really is just reflective of our strategy where Nuvera is morphing into a fuel cell engine company both up from a contract development perspective with third parties as well as the producer of fuel cell stacks and engines. We will become from the lift truck company's perspective, we will become a customer of Nuvera. So there still will be sales to Hyster-Yale Group before those components that will become part of BBRs that Hyster-Yale Group will sell in to the market.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nRight. Yeah, I understand that. That's why I asked.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThe point that can just made because the -- the only sale that you know I think Christy noted that by midyear we expect all of the production of the battery box replacement systems to be up and operating in Greenville. And at that point, Nuvera will no longer be in the business of manufacturing BBRs. They will be manufacturing only fuel cells and fuel cell engines. They will sell fuel cell engine to Hyster-Yale Group, Hyster-Yale Group will then turn that fuel cell engine into a battery box replacement or other forms of fuel cell engines for forklift. And then it's up to Hyster-Yale to carry out the selling, service and support of those BBRs in the field just like we do on any other engine.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. Just one last follow up question I'll hop back in queue if there's anyone that wants to ask any of the questions. The Nuvera fuel cell engine business just to -- so I understand because I think it's important terms of these third party agreements. Is there a risk that they're paying you right now as you -- in your terms to design and produce these engines that can work with their products. Is there a risk that there's not as much follow on revenue that maybe you anticipate in 2020 or beyond.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell I suppose there is, from an intellectual point of view there's always a risk. But I think there's sort of two comments one in one of these contracts there are commitments to certain levels of the volume and an underpinning in those contracts which means that very substantial revenue should be generated and the other one the real production is a bit outside the periods that we're talking about here and comes into play later and it's sort of development and quayside development for the other contract.\nAnd I think that's the best way to think about all this. So we don't see at this point huge risk in that area if we have any concern about the volumes, it's our -- making sure that we have the ability to have be able to manufacture them to have the supply base to support the manufacturing at the levels that we have contracts for and that's what we're really intensely focused on at this time.\nJoe Mondello -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. Well, thank you. I apologize if my questions were a little not as clear just trying to understand the business as much as possible. Thanks.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd that's fine. Thanks.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time. Ms. Christie Kmetko. I turn the call back over to you.\nChristina Kmetko -- Investor Relations Consultant\nJoe, did you have other questions you wanted to ask? Okay.\nAlfred M. Rankin -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nYou know let me just make a couple of concluding comments. I hope that all of you on the call have read the second part of our earnings release which we've called the investor perspective and we've done that because you wanted to distinguish it between an outlook which is very much focused on 2019 and really focused on the fact that we are making a lot of capital expenditure investment and a lot of expense investment right at the moment.\nAnd we see increasing payoff from those in 2020 and 2021 and 2022 and really having many of these programs coming together with reinforcing impact. Now as you'll remember we had an investor perspective on our first quarter earnings release. And so there are some adjustments, there no radical, radically different changes.\nI would just point out what those were or the more significant ones because there are many that, they are words that weren't particularly material that we felt were better language or conveyed what we wanted to say more thoughtfully. I think we did say that while we continue to shoot for break even in the fourth quarter at Nuvera that we now think that we won't get all the way there, we'll be in a position of being significantly improved in having a less -- lower loss. And so that's a bit of a change.\nThe second point that I would call out to you is that at Bolzoni, we have some one-time restructuring charges that were incurred in the first quarter, there'd be some additional ones, but I think it's very important to look at that and a highly positive stance because we have made the decision to put solid agenda in the hands of Bolzoni as a component manufacturing plants where we make our cylinders and a variety of other things.\nAnd Bolzoni will be taking responsibility. It has taken responsibility for that plan and is moving in closing the Homewood plant which as you can imagine just has some significant cost reductions in total because we're taking a plant out of the system. At the same time we've also given Bolzoni, a responsibility to begin to think about selling components as they do with their attachments like cylinders to other participants in both the forklift truck business and other industries. So on the one hand there's a charge but also there is a formalization of a very important project that's going to build a value for the Company.\nAnd I'd call that out for you. I'd call out the decision by the US trade representative with regard to the exclusion request that we had for certain duties. That's that granting of an exemption for us is a new development that was not in the investor perspective. And it's a very focused exemption and we'll be analyzing just how it affects us over the next month or so. But it's a significant issue and then we've already commented.\nThe other thing I'd call out is we do have language about the market levels. And that -- on the one hand we're comfortable with the current market levels that we're going to be watching make very clear closely to see exactly how the market will evolve. But at the current time our thinking is that we still are going to be in a strong market but not quite as buoyant as it had previously been. So all of those are sort of adjustments to our investor perspective. But in total they don't change the fundamentals story which is one of a large number of programs beginning that we've been working on for several years beginning to come together with an influence on the bottom line toward the end of this year and then into next year.\nAnd all three of our businesses and further in a significant way in 2022 and 2023. So I think I'd close with that overview on the investor perspective and what's changed. And generally speaking, I think there are adjustments to the perspective not a fundamental change to the perspective that we laid out and at our fourth quarter earnings announcement. And I would ask if Ken or Colin want to add anything in concluding that was with me -- my thoughts anyway. Christy, anything else from you.\nChristina Kmetko -- Investor Relations Consultant\nNo just that if you do have any follow-up questions my phone number is in the earnings release and I would be happy to follow up with you. Thanks so much for joining us and have a good day.\nOperator\nThank you for participating in today's Hyster-Yale Q1 2019 earnings conference call.
