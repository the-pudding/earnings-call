My name is Christie and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChristian Greyenbuhl -- Vice President-Investor Relations\nThank you, Christie; and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. These materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the quarterly investor presentation that accompanies today's call, as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.\nDuring our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items in the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2019, as well as the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2018. Description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nToday's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.\nFinally, I would like to remind you that last quarter we outlined various changes to our disclosures and reporting, which are now fully implemented. As a result of some of these changes, we noted the desire for supplemental information regarding our new PEO disclosures and guidance. Accordingly, we have provided you with additional slides in our accompanying investor presentation, which we believe will help enhance the understanding of these new disclosures.\nAs always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Christian; and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our first quarter fiscal 2019 results with a revenue of $3.3 billion, up 8% reported, and 7% organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was above our expectations and which was aided in part by the better-than-expected performance of our PEO segment and continued strength in our Employer Services down market offerings. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 28% to $1.20 per share; and in addition to strong revenue and margin performance, benefited from fewer shares outstanding, as well as a lower effective tax rate.\nWe also saw positive momentum in our Employer Services New Business Bookings, which grew 8% in the first quarter, slightly ahead of our expectations. In addition, while we no longer report consolidated bookings, we were especially pleased that the renewed momentum in our PEO from last quarter has continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with strong double-digit bookings growth. In both Employer Services and the PEO, we once again saw improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores and we also continue to expect a 25 to 50 basis point improvement in ES revenue retention for fiscal 2019.\nOverall, we are pleased with our start to the fiscal year, which supports our confidence in our long-term strategy, and our efforts to accelerate our pace of change with care.\nAt our June Investor Day, we had the opportunity to discuss with you our efforts around innovation, and we were excited to continue those discussions in September when we attended HR Tech in Las Vegas and the following week at our annual industry Analyst Day at our Chelsea Innovation Lab. At each of these events we discussed our transformation from a service company supported by technology to a technology company that offers great service, one with a proven ability to anticipate the changing demands of employers from small businesses to global enterprises.\nOur transformation is taking place in the midst of a rapidly evolving landscape. Quite literally, the evolution of work is redefining how work gets done. We believe in our innovation journey and in the opportunities it represents for our clients and our stakeholders. At ADP, we embrace this kind of change and we are excited about what it means for our business and our growth.\nChange has always served as a driving force behind our innovative spirit and we were thrilled to take home this year's HR Tech Awesome New Tech Award for Wisely by ADP, our unique way to help workers manage their financial wellness needs. This is ADP's fourth consecutive year winning this category, an unparalleled accomplishment among HCM companies. Each year that we have earned this award, we find ourselves in the company of impressive tech start-ups, underscoring that while we are big, we are also innovative and nimble.\nAt our industry analyst day, we hosted more than 20 HCM industry analysts. And similar to what we shared with many of you at our Investor Day, we discussed with them our next-gen HCM solutions. We were pleased with the reception that we received as we firmly believe that our solutions are uniquely built to address the key challenges and needs of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world of work. In fact, one well respected analyst summarized this point after the event when he described our new platforms as the disruption that could change the entire HCM market. We are excited to have several clients live on our new platforms and we continue to make good progress on our targets and our development efforts.\nAs the traditional model of work continues to evolve, it is being augmented by a new pay-on-demand model, which is beginning to replace traditional weekly and bi-weekly payrolls. With this evolution in mind, we are excited about our development efforts to build and scale our new payroll and tax engines, which are designed to provide full payroll calculations in real-time at the individual worker level. Taking this a step further with Wisely by ADP, employers of any size and industry can, today, have access to tools to better engage their workforce by providing attractive services such as instant pay, access to a digital wallet, and other financial management and wellness features.\nIn addition to leading with great technology, we are leveraging our unmatched data set to empower our clients, HR practitioners and business leaders with actionable insights. ADP pays one in six US employees, and this scale drives unmatched depth to the insights we can offer through our data cloud and benchmarking solutions. One such solution which is already integrated into the ADP Mobile Solutions app is our Executive and Manager insights tool which leverages machine learning to continually sift through wage, time, location, industry and many other types of data to uncover insights that HR leaders can use to make better, faster and smarter decisions.\nDuring the quarter we also completed our acquisition of Celergo, a provider of multi-country payroll management services. The acquisition further solidifies our global HCM leadership position and enhances our ability to deliver multi-country payroll solutions with a strong platform and new capabilities, including cross-currency and expat payment services.\nIn addition to these new offerings, Celergo also extends our footprint to over 140 countries and brings with it a talented team with significant experience in multi-country payroll, which remains a key area of opportunity for ADP. We're incredibly excited about the potential of Celergo and other recent investment in acquisitions including Global Cash Card and WorkMarket, which collectively expand our ability to address a changing workforce that is increasingly global, freelance and in demand of flexible payment solutions.\nNow, I'd like to touch on some of the key initiatives coming out of our Transformation Office, which has been helping to formalize structure and create the accountability needed to achieve our financial objectives. While our transformation continues to progress at a healthy pace, we are being careful to balance speed with care, underscoring our focus on the long-term and our commitment not to compromise quality for short-term gains. Maintaining the highest standards for our clients, associates and shareholders is our utmost priority. And we are pleased with our ability to execute on our transformation objectives, while also driving improvements in client satisfaction, productivity and the associate experience.\nOur Voluntary Early Retirement Program is progressing as planned. We remain focused on managing this initiative in an orderly and timely manner. Additionally, through our Service Alignment Initiative, we continue to reduce our footprint in subscale locations. And at our new strategic service locations, we are seeing greater efficiency and collaboration, which is helping to enhance the level of service we provide our clients.\nBefore I turn the call over to Jan, I'd like to highlight that we were recently named 2018 Working Mother 100 Best Company. As a leader in the HR community, this is an especially great honor and I am thrilled to see ADP receive the credit for creating an inclusive and diverse workplace, where everyone can bring their best self to work each day. I am proud to lead a company that values the contribution of every individual and has a proven track record for attracting and retaining top talent. This allows us to remain competitive in a dynamic HCM market and has a profound impact on our continued growth and success.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for his commentary on our first quarter results and fiscal 2019 outlook.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Carlos; and good morning, everyone. Our consolidated revenue this quarter was $3.3 billion, up 8% reported and 7% organic constant currency, both above expectations. On a reported basis, earnings before income taxes increased 14%, while our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT increased 18%. Adjusted EBIT margin was slightly above our expectation and was up about 180 basis points compared to last year's fiscal quarter, despite about 50 basis points of pressure from acquisitions, and a $12 million charge related to the write-off of certain internally developed software costs, following our acquisition of Celergo.\nOverall, our margin performance continues to benefit from improvements in our IT infrastructure spend, the lapping of dual operating costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative and the successful execution of our broader transformation initiative, including our Voluntary Early Retirement Program. We were also particularly pleased with our international businesses, where the results of our automation efforts continue to generate positive momentum. Clearly, our efforts to reduce our costs, while also improving our service are beginning to pay off. And we are pleased with the progress that we are making.\nOur adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted by unplanned stock compensation tax benefits, which drove approximately 330 basis points of benefit for the quarter or $0.05 on our adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 28% to $1.20. And in addition from benefiting from our margin performance and a lower effective tax rate was also aided by a fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.\nAs you can tell from these overall results, we are off to a good start this year and we're progressing well as we execute on our strategic plans that we outlined at our June Investor Day.\nNow let me take you through our segment results. For Employer Services, revenues grew 7% for the quarter, 6% organic constant currency, both ahead of our expectations. Interest from client funds grew 19% and benefited from a 30 basis points improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments and growth in average client fund balances of about 5% compared to a year ago. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control offset by a pressure from the corporate tax reform and lower state unemployment insurance collections. Our same-store pays per control metric in the US grew 2.4% for the quarter.\nOur international solutions continued to perform well, supported by the continued strong double-digit growth of our multinational offerings. Investing in our global solutions and leveraging our global presence to service our clients wherever they do business remains a key strategic pillar for us. And we were especially pleased this quarter to be able to complete our recent strategic acquisition of Celergo to further complement our offerings in this space.\nMoving on to Employer Services margin, we saw an increase of about 260 basis points in the quarter, which included approximately 90 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions. As you will recall, our Voluntary Early Retirement Program is being managed over the course of multiple phases throughout this fiscal year. As we progress against our backfill targets for the year, this quarter we saw benefits from early exits which we do not anticipate to carry forward into the remainder of the fiscal year, as we accelerate our targeted backfill hiring plans.\nPEO revenue grew 10% for the quarter with average Worksite Employees growing 9% to 528,000. Following a difficult fiscal year 2018 in the 50 employee and above market, we were pleased to see signs of a continued recovery in our PEO New Business Bookings this quarter and also some early signs of improvements in our client retention. While we are pleased with this performance, it's also important to remember that we're nearing the calendar-end when clients in our industries are more likely to reevaluate their provider.\nThe PEO segment margins increased 110 basis points for the quarter and benefited from operating leverage and selling efficiencies, partially offset by the impact from changes in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity.\nNow on to our fiscal year 2019 outlook. This quarter, I would like to start first by talking about the segment outlook before we move on to our consolidated outlook. As a reminder, as of last quarter, we're providing incremental guidance for our segment revenue in particular. We believe, you will find this helpful and we encourage you to leverage this, and the long-term revenue model that we shared at our Investor Day.\nWith that said, let's discuss our outlook. While our first quarter Employer Services revenue growth was ahead of our expectations, we now anticipate incremental pressure from FX as the year progresses. We also want to remind you that we are lapping our acquisition of Global Cash Card in the second quarter, and as such, we continue to expect 4% to 6% revenue growth for the ES segment. We still anticipate growth of 2.5% in our pays per control metric. There's no change in our forecasted growth of ES New Business Bookings of 6% to 8% and we continue to anticipate a more difficult grow-over in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Carlos mentioned, we also continue to anticipate an increase in ES retention of 25 to 50 basis points for fiscal year 2019.\nFinally, while our ES margins were stronger than expected this quarter, we continue to anticipate a ramp-up in resources as we execute on our backfill hiring plans related to our Voluntary Early Retirement Program. As such, we do not anticipate as strong a margin expansion in the latter half of the fiscal year 2018, as we saw in the first quarter. And therefore, we continue to anticipate full-year margin expansion of about 150 to 175 basis points, inclusive of 50 basis points of acquisition drag.\nWith that said, let's now touch on the PEO. We now expect 8% to 9% PEO revenue growth in fiscal year 2019, driven by 8% to 9% growth in average Worksite Employees, as compared to our prior forecasted increase of 7% to 9% for revenue and 7% to 8% for average Worksite Employees. As Carlos mentioned, we have seen some progress in our PEO bookings this quarter, following some of our targeted adjustments that we made last year to our PEO distribution process. We now expect to see a slight improvement in our PEO performance relative to prior expectations. With that, we had a fairly strong second quarter revenue growth last year driven in part by a combination of solid Worksite Employee growth and strong pass-throughs.\nWith these adjustments in mind, we now anticipate 6% to 7% growth in the PEO revenues excluding zero margin pass-throughs, as compared to our prior forecast of 5% to 7%. As a reminder, the reason this growth is slightly below that of average Worksite Employees is due to the impact in fiscal year 2019 from the decline in our workers' compensation and SUI rates relative to fiscal year 2018. This does not affect the administrative services pricing environment which has remained a stable contributor to our overall revenue growth.\nLast quarter, we received a few questions regarding our new pass-through disclosures. With that in mind, in our effort to help you better understand the dynamics that we anticipate experienced in this year, we have provided you with some additional details in the appendix of our quarterly investor presentation. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these slides as they help to illustrate the impact from lower workers' compensation and SUI rates, as well as other drivers in the business.\nMoving on to PEO margins, with a better-than-expected performance in our PEO margin this quarter, we now expect 50 to 25 points margin decrease as compared to our prior forecasted decrease of 75 to 50 basis points. For the reasons we mentioned before, we continue to anticipate our Voluntary Early Retirement backfill hiring to accelerate over the next few months. Accordingly, we do not expect this quarter's margin over performance to carry fully through for the remainder of the year.\nFinally, I would like to remind you that the results of ADP Indemnity are now recorded within the PEO segment. This quarter, we had lower-than-anticipated grow-over pressure from adjustments to our lost reserve estimates. And as a result, we now anticipate approximately 50 basis points of grow-over pressure on a full-year basis as compared to our prior forecast of approximately 75 basis points.\nMoving on to the consolidated outlook. We now anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019, with the upper end of our forecast range dependent on the continued steady improvements and the performance of our PEO. We are now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase $90 million to $100 million compared to our prior forecasted increase of $80 million to $90 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $70 million to $80 million compared to the prior forecasted increase of $60 million to $70 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides in our Investor Relations website.\nWe continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand 100 to 125 basis points including approximately 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions.\nWith the impact of the first quarter stock compensation related tax benefit, we now expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24.5% in fiscal year 2019, as compared to our prior adjusted effective tax rate of 25.1%.\nWith these various adjustments to our outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 15% to 17%.\nOverall, I think you can tell we are happy with our start into the year with the continued momentum that we're building from our investments in the business, we are executing well on our key initiatives and we were pleased to see a positive trend in our bookings this quarter.\nSo with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, guys. Nice job here. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the bookings here. So you came in at the high end of the full year range in Q1. But based on the disclosures you gave us on ES bookings for last year, obviously, the comps actually get a lot harder, especially in the back-half which you highlighted. It sounds like you've got a lot of confidence still in the 6% to 8%. Anything you'd highlight from a pipeline perspective, whether it's down-market, mid-market, enterprise, et cetera, just supporting that confidence in the full year number? Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I think our confidence is really driven by our -- I guess, the information that we have around where we are around headcount, where we are around kind of new product rollouts and where we are around kind of productivity improvements, which are kind of the three ways that we kind of add up to the overall sales growth. As you know, it can vary from quarter-to-quarter, but I think we built a great plan, I think, with the right number of people, I think, with the right products. And I think we've shown over the last probably three to four quarters, I think, really improvements in underlying productivity that then support kind of that third pillar of what leads to the overall growth.\nSo I think, we feel -- I think you're right that the tone is probably one of confidence, but there's always, for us, the sales number is the one that has the most variability and the most volatility, because every sale is a new sale every quarter, whereas -- and our revenue model is really a recurring revenue model. So there's always more variability in sales, but I would say, nothing has changed in terms of the level of content that we have in our ability to reach our full year numbers.\nWe did have a very strong fourth quarter. Sometimes historically that has led to challenges in the first quarter just because of the way our incentives work. So in some respects, I would probably say that I was pleased with the fact that we were able to even though we had an easier comparison to the prior year, the fact that we came off of a very strong fourth quarter, I think sometimes presents some headwinds, so the ability to kind of hit the numbers that we did this quarter which as -- you're seeing, obviously, Employer Services number, but as Jan maybe alluded to, even though we're not giving specific guidance, our PEO results were also very strong. So when you look at kind of New Business Bookings collectively, if you did it the way we used to do it, which we're not doing anymore, we would say that we were extremely pleased and it adds to our confidence for the full year.\nJason Kupferberg -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOkay. And let me just --\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nOne comment.\nJason Kupferberg -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nYeah, please. Go ahead, Jan. Sorry.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThe success was fairly broad-based. And so when I look at the different components of our sales force, the different channels and the different market segments that we sell into, it was really a broad-based contribution of many. So it was not focused on a single segment at all, actually broad-based participation is always a good start to the year.\nJason Kupferberg -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nFor sure. Let me just ask a follow-up on PEO since you highlighted that, and I know last quarter there was a little bit of controversy or concern there, clearly a nice rebound. So just wanted to test the sustainability of that; maybe you can talk about some of the strategies that you've employed to actually drive the improved performance and the outlook there. I think last quarter you were talking about tweaking some incentive programs, but any other strategies you would highlight there?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I think that -- Jan probably has a couple of comments as well, but I would say that we did tweak the incentives. I would say that it's beginning to roll its way through. But I wouldn't say -- I wish I could say that, it all was because of how smart we were and changing those incentives, but I think we see big improvements in pipeline in the up-market as a result of some of those incentive changes, but not necessarily yet affecting the numbers.\nSo ironically, this was really a kind of a rebound of kind of what I will call core PEO performance. So, again, that makes me again very optimistic about the next couple of quarters and the full year for PEO New Business Bookings, because we have to see, have the benefits of some of the incentive changes we made, which I think, makes sense and I think are really just adjustments back to frankly prior we didn't do anything artificial or aggressive to try to overcome some kind of externality, we we were kind of readjusting back to normal levels some of incentives that we had changed to other HR BPO products a couple of years ago.\nSo I think that when I add all the things together, it feels like just really as usual, it comes back to great execution. I think, there's just more focus and more attention on kind of the basics and the core of generating new leads by our sales force, as well as making sure that they are more effective in getting the leads from our other -- the other parts of our sales force in ADP. So I think it's just overall just much better execution.\nAnd then, lastly, I would say that again here you have maybe the opposite effect of what I described, but what usually happens when you have a strong finish, sometimes you get into a stronger -- sorry, a weaker start which didn't happen to us this first quarter. But in the PEO, we did have a challenging year and sometimes in some parts of our organization when you come off of a challenging year, you have a -- so last year may have been not as weak as maybe it looked and this first quarter was, I think, it's probably the strongest growth we've had, I think, ever in the PEO.\nSorry, since -- I'm being corrected here, probably since Q2 of fiscal year 2014. But the numbers are -- were already big in 2014, and they're even bigger today. So I think to generate in percentage terms kind of growth rate we generated this quarter is quite impressive, I think, and it shows that the value proposition is still intact and the sales leadership and sales execution still has the ability to kind of take advantage, if you will, of that value proposition and get it to the market in a competitive way.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nI just have a few data points that really support what Carlos said. We saw not only improvement in our deals over 50 which we accelerated, but we had overall for the PEO channel very brisk new logo growth in the high-double digits, so a very impressive broad base. So it's not only a single thing like a commission change for the mid-market or an incentive change in the mid-market that drove this. It's a management focus and have created a broad-based acceleration of New Business Bookings that I think we've managed also to improve with very solid client satisfaction scores and great execution. So that created then our confidence to really up the guidance for that segment.\nJason Kupferberg -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOkay. Well, great. That's nice color. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning, guys. In fiscal 2018, I believe, you grew client growth down in the lower end of the market in like the 12% range, a really strong number. Can you give a little color as to whether that momentum in those share gains in the small and medium business market are continuing as you look into 2019?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I think the first quarter was very consistent with kind of the momentum and the trend we've had for, I don't think it was just fiscal year 2018, it probably wasn't quite as strong in 2017, but we've had good strong momentum I think in our down-market business and I think it continued into the first quarter.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nFirst quarter is right in line with the trend that we have seen in 2018, Lisa.\nLisa Ellis -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. And then I think, complementary question is just one around the mid-market where I know as you were going through the workforce now transition, you were sort of hanging on to your client counts in that market, which we know it's very competitive. Now that you're through the workforce, now migrations, are you seeing some improvements there, some growth in the client base in that market, if nothing else just driven by improvements in retention?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, so we have seen a very consistent improvement in our retention rates out of the -- from the lows that we had about 2 and 2.5 year ago. And so we are very pleased with the improvement that we have seen, A, through all the clients being now on a single platform, the stabilization and improvement in the new service models that we rolled out as part of the Service Alignment Initiative, and very steady retention has been improving.\nAnd so the new sale success, if I -- in this market if I just take like an average for the last rolling 12 months or so, we have also seen much, much stronger focus on the new logo execution that we reported to you on focusing on new distribution channels to partners, as well as leveraging sales force adjustments to focus on this. And I think we're still in the early stages of seeing a full turnaround for that, but we're seeing very good signs that this new logos focus will pay off over time.\nYeah. And in this quarter -- I would just add that this quarter we actually happened to have good logo growth in the upper end of the mid-market, which for us is, call it, 500 to 1,000 or 150 to 500 and kind of that space there. And so, again, quarter-to-quarter numbers is tricky in terms of the sales results, but I think there's definitely renewed focus and attention and these are incentives that we adjusted different from what we were talking about in the PEO case, more call it, 18 to 24 months ago as we exited ACA. We try to get our sales force more focused on core logo growth and I would say that we feel like it's working and we're making progress and the combination of that along with improving retention. I think is -- we still have work to do, but I think is getting our mid-market business into a stronger position especially now that we're on one platform.\nLisa Ellis -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst\nTerrific. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJames Schneider -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up to Lisa's question. I understand you're not giving explicit retention metrics on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but it sounds like on the basis of the consumer satisfaction scores, you talked about improving, that retention probably is just directionally up year-over-year. Can you confirm that's the case or not? And maybe just kind of talk about whether there's any pockets of down, mid or up market, they're kind of falling above or below your expectations?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nSo I think, as you heard, I think, in the comments we confirmed our forecast for increased retention of, I believe, it's 25 to 50 basis points for the year. So you could probably interpret that as directionally up for the year. But given that we're not providing retention guidance as part of the package of -- we had a lot of disclosures, and I think, if you look at the amount of stuff that we just put out, I think, historically in response to some extent to some of the feedback we got after the proxy contests we're doing what we can to add additional disclosure and I think that's one of the items that we're not going to be getting into on a quarterly basis. But I think that you should interpret our confidence and reaffirmation of our guidance as confidence that the trend of retention is up.\nJames Schneider -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. And then maybe kind of as a follow-up, with respect to your full year guidance, I know you talked about several grow-over issues with respect to acquisitions and a couple of other things that kind of get harder in terms of comps for the year. But I think for the full year guidance, it implies that growth slows down across almost every metric relative to what you already reported in Q1. So I'm just trying to understand whether there is anything that kind of give you pause about a potential slowdown in growth or whether there is some wiggle room potentially baked into the guidance? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nSo as you can imagine, we spent some time talking about that. Make sure you guys walked away with the right message which is one of confidence and optimism and pride and really were good results. But there are some mathematical issues that I think are just important noting. So I think two that stand out for me are Global Cash Card was not quite a 1% impact, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 1% impact on revenue growth, and that we lap, I believe, it's in the middle of October. And then FX pressure not just for us, but for all companies is picking up a little bit. It's not a huge headwind, but that obviously can change in either directions.\nBut based on the information that we have today and the math, we kind of laid out what we thought was reasonable changes in guidance, while trying to convey really our sense of optimism and confidence and positiveness in what the results were. So it's hard to -- given that it's the first quarter, it's also frankly hard for us to just kind of come out and kind of across the board change everything given that we still have three quarters ahead of us. But we want to make sure that you've got a message of confidence and optimism and pride in the first quarter, but we want to make sure that the math rolls through in the appropriate manner.\nJames Schneider -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nReceived loud and clear. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. A strong start to FY 2019. I'd like to ask about pricing trends as you head into the critical year-end selling season. What are you seeing in terms of kind of price net of discounting on a year-over-year basis?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nFunny you should mention that, because back to the previous question in terms of one thing that we just don't want to take one quarter and assume that it's going to continue on, but we have seen, I would say, a better environment in terms of overall discounting and pricing and so forth. And the issue is there's no scientific way to know how much of that is -- I don't think the competition is getting any easier. I think we're getting better and stronger, our value proposition and our client satisfaction scores, other things that probably work into that mix, so in a very difficult environment where you have challenges like we had during ACA because of high volumes and caused them deterioration, short-term deterioration in our service level, that probably leaves elevated concessions and pricing on pressure, et cetera, the sales force gets -- starts to lose a little bit of its confidence. And so I think we've regained a lot of that momentum and it comes through, in part, it comes through in retention, it comes through in bookings and it comes through in pricing and discounting.\nSo I guess, it's a long way of saying I can't answer your question, because we don't know how much of what appears to be a better environment for us is related to economic versus issues around our own house being in better order versus the competition. If I had to guess, I would say it has not to do with the competition, because the competition is still very fierce and there's plenty of competitors, and we are always out there sharpening our pencils, especially when we're so focused on bringing in new new logos. So I think it's just we're just doing a better job and it's translating to overall a better level of -- and that translates into our revenue growth, translates into retention, it just has a lot of positive impacts.\nDavid Togut -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nUnderstood. And then as a follow-up, you seem very optimistic about Celergo and the potential for multi-country payroll. We haven't heard that much about international payroll processing in a while. Can you tell us how you're pulling together global view Vantage HCM and now Celergo to go to market internationally?\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. David, two answers for that. Actually, this quarter we had particularly strong performance of our international operations, which resulted in create New Business Bookings in that sector, create margin expansion, really very, very solid good retentions, very solid performance internationally. When we talk internationally, this extends in this quarter for both the best of the countries where we serve local clients outside the US, as well as our strength in our multi-country and multinational solutions.\nAnd Celergo and our business that we call streamline will be fully integrated and become our multi-country solution that services client needs with smaller employee populations in those countries. And global view has always been targeted for our multinational clients that have large populations in each of these countries. But both product components or service components are basically sold together today as bundles and an integrated multi-country solution.\nSo we are so excited about it, because we see that ADP is truly differentiated, and our ability, basically, we would claim the only vendor who can offer multi-country solutions at this scale, at this consistency to that many clients of different needs. And we made an investment into Celergo to further expand that differentiation in the space, which has been so successful for us. So view Celergo as a technology addition that will enhance our serviceability for many of these clients big or small and broaden our depth and in particular kind of enhances our differentiation versus our competitors in that space.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I think that -- only I would add to that which is I completely echo all those comments. I think, in the prepared comments we made a comment that it still remains one of our biggest opportunities. So that's part of why we're excited. We're excited because of the call of the acquisition and the team that we got and the product and the technology, but also because it's a large growth opportunity for us. So there's a large market out there. Even though we are, I think, a market leader, there's still a lot more opportunities there, and obviously any time that we have the ability to go into and accelerate into markets that have big opportunities, that's exciting to us.\nDavid Togut -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you very much. Hey, I wonder if you could just give us a little more color on what allows you to increase the -- or decrease kind of the margin impact from the PEO on the ADP Indemnity side. It sounds like maybe it wasn't as bad as feared, just a little more context on that.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nKevin, I appreciate the question. This has largely to do with our change in financial disclosures that we instituted for this fiscal year. Last year and really in prior years we undergo a process in which our workers' compensation indemnity evaluates the expected future losses that we have anticipated. And if there are changes to the expected future payments, we book adjustments, we historically have booked these adjustments in other segment.\nAnd we changed now with our financial disclosures to include the results of indemnity into the PEO where they belong, so that you have a true picture of the full performance of the PEO including these loss reserve adjustments that we book basically on a quarterly basis when warranted. And we had last year meaningful benefit for these loss reserve adjustments that created for us a grow-over pressure of 75 basis points which we have not forecasted for the PEO when we gave guidance in August. And so the first quarter is now over and we booked a loss reserve adjustment that was favorable and enhanced the results of the PEO. We had not put that into our guidance and now the results are better. So we let that positive expected loss reserve adjustment flow through and that basically adds to profit in the PEO sector.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So I think you made the comment that it wasn't as bad as you expected. To be clear, what Jan is saying is, we had a big benefit in the first quarter last year and we were worried about whether we would have that site as the -- you can't really forecast these things a year in advance, which is why with good intentions we used to have this in other, to avoid exactly these discussions and these kind of ups and downs in the PEO segment. But I think we did come to the conclusion that we believe that it does belong in the PEO segment, we're putting it there. So now we have to, going forward, make sure we give you the appropriate amount of color, so you understand what's happening. So this was in essence a large benefiting gain that we had through an adjustment of lost reserves in the first quarter of last year compared to a smaller gain this first quarter, but that smaller gain was bigger than what we anticipated, if that makes any sense.\nKevin McVeigh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nNo, it does. I apologize for the verbiage. It was more just I guess relative to the initial expectations of 50 to 75 -- 50 to 25. Awesome. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nNandan Amladi -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So at the June Investor Day, you talked about the Early Retirement Plan being more successful, I guess, higher uptake than you were initially expecting. You've touched a little bit on the backfill plans. Can you describe a little bit more what your plans are for the remainder of the year for total headcount and what areas of the business you are hiring in?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So I think one of the key words in some of the prepared comments we had, we used the word care in a few places. And I just want to reemphasize that that in June the implication that it was kind of more successful because it was more people that -- it was more successful from a financial standpoint, so on the spreadsheets it looks great. But we do have to execute on all of these transformation efforts with care, we have to maintain high NPS scores and good execution.\nAnd so we, I think, adjusted our backfill plans based on the volume of uptake that we got and also based on timing of the exits and which parts of the business were critical. It was critical for us to make sure that we had the right people in place to be able to handle the right volumes, especially at calendar year-end.\nSo saying all that, I think we had a plan that as you can imagine we would never have a Voluntary Early Retirement Program and then plan to backfill every single position; that would have not been, I think, probably a good use of our capital and that was not what our intention was. So we thought that because of some of the work we had been doing previously around transformation to take work out that we had an opportunity to, over the course of, call it, 12 months, to offer this attractive package to some of our tenured associates, and it feels like it's working.\nAnd so if you think through what we've done is we have three different waves of departures, and so they are scheduled to leave over different periods of time over the 12 months since the date we announced the Early Retirement Program and we also had plans to backfill some of those positions over the same 12-month period of time. So what you're hearing in our comments is, if that process, there was a plan around all that process, and the one that we control the most is the departures. And that's exactly on track and on schedule.\nBut in terms of the backfills, we were a little bit quote-unquote behind on the backfills, which creates a short-term financial benefit that we saw in the first quarter. But if you roll forward and you look at our original plans which we're sticking to for the rest of the year, it creates not as big a benefit in the first quarter.\nHaving said all that, we feel that when you look at the momentum in the PEO and Employer Services and other parts of our business, it gives us confidence in the performance of the business overall. So the first quarter financial performance was not solely and only because of this issue around the timing of backfills. It was one part and I would say it was a relatively small part. So we don't want to give you the wrong impression about our confidence in the future going forward, but we just wanted to make sure we clarified that we do have more backfills in the next few quarters than we had in the first quarter, and we think some of that was due to timing.\nIf we feel like we've taken out more work than we thought we were able to take out, we might not have as many of the backfills as we had in the original plan. But for now, the most important thing for us to focus on is quality and year-end, and NPS scores and client retention. So we're not ready to come off of our original plans yet.\nNandan Amladi -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst\nThank you. Very helpful.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. Just wanted to follow up on that, on Employer Services, besides hiring, is there any other additional reasons why the margins would drop back down to the fiscal year 2019 guidance range?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nAgain, another one we spent a lot of time talking about. I think, that's a fair question. That's one of the -- one of the items is that one. I think that we have -- the FX headwind is probably some part of it, because we did have some FX benefit. Just to clarify, even though we had a FX headwind on the revenue side, we had some FX benefit in the first quarter, as some of our costs that we have overseas went down faster than planned or more than what we had planned. Specifically, we have a large offshore operation in India and I think that cost came in very favorable in the first quarter and well ahead of our plan.\nSo I think there's probably a number of things that when you roll them together including the fact that it's only the first quarter and so we're just not prepared, for example, the strength that I mentioned in terms of improvement in concessions and pricing and so forth, if you roll those things forward and you assume they're going to continue, then we would expect a better second, third and fourth quarter. We're just not prepared this early in the year. And I think it's traditional for us like we -- the fact that we raised PEO guidance is unusual for us, because -- and I think it's prudent and I'm not sure what other companies do, but until we have more visibility and until we get through calendar year-end, as a reminder, the next quarter, this quarter that we are in now today is an important part of our New Business Bookings for the year and also December 31st represents an important measure of retention, because clients tend to switch providers at that time of the year. So I think you should expect us coming out of the second quarter to have a stronger view and position.\nBryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOkay. No, that's helpful. Go ahead, Jan. Yeah, go ahead.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nI'm sorry to -- I add a few more comments of insights about the drivers of our margin expansion that may help you to do. And so part is that rehiring anticipation for our VERP, but we had also -- I think, as it turns out, the second-half is not as good as the first-half. And I think there's a little bit of this left in our asymmetry of margin that compares to prior years. So the second-half is a little bit more difficult grow-over, I think, for us and some of the success that we had with some of the initiatives that we initiated in the last half of the fiscal year, we had great scale for example in our INO organization, our IT infrastructure is making progress and contributed, we had exceptional productivity improvements on our sales force for the start of the year that would be not reasonable to assume that that type of level of productivity improvement is continuing throughout the year as we go through. So they are like some just natural business reasons that make you think as early in the fiscal year to kind of keep the margin expectations as we had them.\nBryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGot it. And then I wanted to ask about the US outlook. ADP has a great look at the US economy and currently lots of concern in the market. Are you guys seeing any cracks in the US economy at this point?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nZero.\nBryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nYes. All right. Well, that's a good sign. All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman -- Stifel Financial -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning. Carlos, maybe you could spend a little bit more time and just on the up-market, obviously we've been making some product modifications and you talked a little bit about sales strategies in the up-market. Can you give us a little more detail in terms of where we are, not necessarily focusing on the quarter, but just kind of how you feel about that business and the progress that you're making?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nFeeling really good about the progress that we're making there. I think we talked about several quarters ago the fact that we kind of more institutionalized our ability to sell workforce now in the lower end of the up-market, I think, 1,000 to 3,000 or 1,000 to 5,000 Worksite Employees where we think that workforce now can really compete very strongly with certain parts of that segment, whereas Vantage can compete in that segment, but competes even better in larger more complex clients in the up-market.\nSo I think that adjustment in strategy has paid off. When you combine the new logo growth in the up-market between workforce now and Vantage, I would say we're very pleased by the progress. And I think new logo growth, as you can hear in our comments, we're constantly talking about that because we love new -- we love additional revenue from other products, we love incremental sales to existing clients, but the heart and soul, the strength of a business is market share and new logo growth. And I think on that metric, we're feeling good about the progress that we're making in the up-market.\nIt's still early days for some of the next-gen solutions that we're selling, but we're making some headway there, also where we have a handful of clients. So clearly at our size and our scale, a handful of clients isn't making a difference on the numbers, but it's building confidence in both our sales force and in the marketplace. And so, by the way, we're also seeing really good progress in client satisfaction scores in the up-market, which I think, are usually leading indicators of retention and also of New Business Bookings. And even if I look at the underlying revenue growth of that business, it's better than it was last year. We still have work to do, but we're feeling good about the progress.\nDavid Grossman -- Stifel Financial -- Analyst\nAnd are there any milestone dates we should think about in terms of product enhancements or anything like that coming up?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nWell, not that we can share with you, because we've had some challenges with the competitors saying things that are not accurate in the marketplace around our products and our strategy, which is a shame, because we usually try to take the highroad. I won't mention who those competitors are, but I think it's not helpful for us to talk about specific dates, because we're trying to provide investors with transparency and clarity and so forth. And unfortunately, some people take advantage of that situation. But I think, at Investor Day, we gave you a decent amount of information around what we were doing around Vantage and then also what our plans were in terms of our next-gen product. And I think I would probably refer back to that.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nAnd we're on plan and feeling good about those plans.\nDavid Grossman -- Stifel Financial -- Analyst\nOkay. Got it. Thanks. And just one last one just in terms of -- you mentioned these changing employment models and I know you've made some acquisitions there. But can you give us any sense of just how impactful or the timing of when that really becomes an important competitive dynamic in the marketplace to have those capabilities or maybe it's happening right now, I don't know?\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nI mean, I think it's an important competitive dynamic right now. I think it helps our value proposition and our story which is part of the -- what's important is the value proposition and the outcomes you deliver. I think, on that front, given our scale and the size of these acquisitions, we haven't rolled these products out to 100% of our client base or even to probably even 1% of our client base. But it does add to the strength of our sales force in terms of what they have as a value proposition in the marketplace. And medium-to-long term, I think, we believe it's going to be a very significant enhancement.\nSo I think in the short-term, the biggest short-term benefit has been and probably continue to be Global Cash Card, because it's such an in-demand product, and it's such a strong and good value proposition and they're executing so well, that -- and they were already somewhat large in comparison to some of the other acquisitions that we made, that I would say that's the one that has the most immediate short-term impact. But I think, Celergo, WorkMarket and I would even go back to TMBC, The Marcus Buckingham Company, all these acquisitions are big strengtheners to our value proposition and our ability to win share in the marketplace.\nDavid Grossman -- Stifel Financial -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks very much.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThanks. Good results here. On the PEO, that 8% to 9% Worksite Employee growth, I'm curious how would you benchmark that against industry growth for PEO, because we've had mixed reviews or mixed numbers figures from the peer group, so I thought I'd ask you.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nI would say that if you take the two numbers that you have that you're referring to and you average them, ours is higher.\nTien-tsin Huang -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nYeah, simple math.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n(multiple speakers) The PEO industry has a long-term growth that we shared with you in the Investor Day and we are obviously aiming to be in -- getting back to double-digits which has been a big discussion for us in particular since the last quarter and we're well on our way and that would help us to drive market -- continue our long story of market share gains.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nIt's impressive, like this is a big PEO (inaudible) with a lot of Worksite Employees. And the number of new Worksite Employees that we have to sell each month and each quarter to generate the kind of growth rate that we just generated this quarter is impressive.\nTien-tsin Huang -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nYeah. No, you're the biggest player, just not lost on us. Thanks for that. On the bookings, just to clarify, I know you noted the tougher second-half comps. Just curious, can you replenish the backlog and produce enough new sales and still land in that 6% to 8% zone in the second half of the year. I suppose, mathematically you can go to 5%, 6% and still be at the low-end, but I'm curious because it's such a big comp as the year progresses.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, look, there are different selling seasons in our business and different markets have different things. When I compare the first half of growth to our second half of growth, it looks pretty good -- not quite as good, we clearly recognize the fourth quarter is difficult, so we have a different thing. But the confidence in the sales force to achieve the overall plan which is obviously helped us to establish our guidance is high, so.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nWe're definitely not trying to manage to the full year number.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nNo, we won't do it (multiple speakers).\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nI mean, our goal would be to do what you just described, which is, we want to outperform and not just get what we need in order to meet the forecast.\nTien-tsin Huang -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thanks for the time.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our last question is from James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJames Berkley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick follow up on an earlier PEO question. Do you see any risk to your 11% to 14% medium-term guidance? I assume there's no reason to back off there, given the strength you're seeing now. And could you quantify maybe in growth or basis point terms what the headwind is that you saw or seeing still from, to some extent, from the incentive changes and then the ACA related downgrades and other factors you mentioned on last quarter's call, so we can get a feel.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nLet me tie this back to the long-term outlook that we gave in our Investor Day. And there are two main factors that I would think about this is related to achieving our revenue targets for the PEO in the longer term. One is, I think that we don't control and which is the growth of our zero margin pass-through revenue growth, which is actually the biggest factor. And so we have changes in healthcare inflation, changes in participation rates in the health insurance way that are driven by industry dynamics that we don't control. And so that trend had shown some pressure in the last year of our fiscal year and is ongoing really if we think so. So that will put pressure on that long-term goal, we have zero economic benefit to -- zero economic impact to ADP, but so from that I think that's a pressure that we would have acknowledged in that, that is there for the revenue number, but for the bottom-line number, it would have no impact.\nAnd then the second component is clearly what we have been focusing on in this call, which is the drive of our Worksite Employee growth, which is, of course, a factor of our sales execution, as well as our retention. And we feel optimistic that our sales force has enough potential to sell these new clients even though the scale is kind of big and it's hard work, but the increased momentum in the last two quarters of our sales give us optimism that the model reacts to it. And you saw that we are upticking our Worksite Employee and revenue growth already after a couple of quarters of good sales success. So that works for us and it has been aided also by very good retention pretty good this quarter in the PEO.\nSo those factors drive the revenue growth more than anything that we control and we have a lot of focus in the management team on it. So I think we -- aside from that pass-through pressure that I really don't work to offset here in order to make the revenue number, we feel good about the strategic outlook of the PEO.\nJames Berkley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks. And then just lastly on the multinational side, I think, you said they grew low-double digits in the quarter. I don't know if you possibly could just kind of size that and where do you think maybe the TAM is for that and talk about your recent acquisitions and the potential for that to maybe accelerate and just kind of your plans in the international market or multinational space in general?\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, for a very long time, our multinational solutions have really grown in the mid-teens very consistently, and in that we see that's -- those are all plans we execute and there's really no change in our outlook. I think the Celergo thing is just another component if you think in the longer term that drives our differentiation, will enhance our opportunities for an ambitious growth rate.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I think the TAM is large. I mean, we have it somewhere in the data that I get, but I honestly can't remember (inaudible) you look at our market share and you look at the size of the market, I think we actually may have even had it in our Investor Day materials, if you want to go back and refer to it. But the one of the things that Jan mentioned in his comments, he used the term multi-country payroll, so we have these multinational solutions which are in some cases we're referring to very large companies that are in 15, 20 countries. But there also are a lot of companies that are operating in two or three countries, maybe in France, but you have two other countries in Europe or a couple of countries in Asia and they may be mid-sized companies. So the TAM is also something that probably is growing over time as people realize that the market is actually bigger than what we thought. So I think if you talk to our international leaders, they would say that this was very, very crucial because of the size of that multi-country payroll market that was kind of underserved. So we're hoping that that kind of opens up new opportunities as well.\nJan Siegmund -- Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nAnd just to state the obvious, in this market, our clients are not only HCM clients of ourselves but we partner a lot with ERP systems and large ERP vendors for clients who choose to partner with us on their multi-country payroll solutions. So the market size that we address really spans a variety of client types which allows us really for long and sustained revenue growth.\nJames Berkley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThanks a lot. Great quarter.\nOperator\nThank you. And this does conclude our Q&A portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nSo thank you very much for your questions today. As you probably could tell we're off to a really good start. Even though we have a lot to accomplish, still we're very pleased with the progress that we've made. I also want to thank our associates, because besides having our investors embrace, change in our transformation, I think it can't happen without the support of our associates and our leaders. So I really appreciate the support we're getting internally as we drive our transformation, so that we create, as Jan just referred to, a long and sustainable revenue growth for another 70 years. So next I believe it's next June we actually reach our 70th birthday and we didn't get here by not making it through multiple changes in technology and economic cycles. And this transformation effort is intended to position us to be successful for another 70 years. So I think we're well on our way to doing that, at least, positioning ourselves for the 70 years not the actual 70 years, but we appreciate the support of all of our stakeholders including all of you, but also our associates in what has obviously been a very fast-changing environment for us.\nSo with that, I will thank you once again and appreciate your continued interest in ADP.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.
